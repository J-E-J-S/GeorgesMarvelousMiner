The protein comprises a photosensitive light-, oxygen- and voltage-sensitive (LOV) domain and a basic zipper (bZIP) domain that binds DNA rendering aureochrome 1 a prospective optogenetic tool. Here, we studied the photoreaction of full-length aureochrome 1 by molecular spectroscopy. The kinetics of the decay of the red-shifted triplet state and the blue-shifted signaling state were determined by time-resolved UV/Vis spectroscopy. It is shown that the presence of the bZIP domain further prolongs the lifetime of the LOV<sub>390</sub> signaling state in comparison to the isolated LOV domain whereas bound DNA does not influence the photocycle kinetics. The light-dark Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectrum shows the characteristic features of the flavin mononucleotide chromophore except that the S-H stretching vibration of cysteine 254, which is involved in the formation of the thio-adduct state, is significantly shifted to lower frequencies compared to other LOV domains. The presence of the target DNA influences the light-induced FTIR difference spectrum of aureochrome 1. Vibrational bands that can be assigned to arginine and lysine side chains as well to the phosphate backbone, indicate crucial changes in interactions between transcription factor and DNA.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) within the Forschergruppe 1279 &#x0201c;Protein-based photoswitches as optogenetic tools&#x0201d; given to IS and JH. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dfg.de">www.dfg.de</ext-link>.

The recently discovered BL receptor aureochrome (Aureo) from <italic>Vaucheria frigida</italic> controls the light dependent development of these Xanthophytes. <italic>Vaucheria frigida</italic> owns two different aureochromes, aureochrome 1 and aureochrome 2. While aureochrome 1 mediates the BL-induced branching process of the cell/filaments <xref rid="pone.0103307-Takahashi1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, aureochrome 2 controls the development of a sex organ. Both aureochromes contain a LOV (light-, oxygen- and voltage-sensitive) domain and a basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) domain <xref rid="pone.0103307-Takahashi2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>LOV domains, a subfamily of the Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) family, are common BL sensitive domains, present in many light-sensitive proteins <xref rid="pone.0103307-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. These domains show a typical PAS domain fold consisting of a five-stranded antiparallel &#x003b2;-sheet and four helices. A non-covalently bound flavin mononucleotide (FMN) moiety located within this fold acts as the chromophore of the domain <xref rid="pone.0103307-Christie1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The ground state (LOV<sub>447</sub>) of LOV domains has an absorption maximum at around 447 nm. When a blue photon is absorbed by the FMN chromophore, the protein undergoes a photocycle that includes two spectrally distinct intermediate states. The first intermediate LOV<sub>715</sub> is formed on a nano-second timescale due to intersystem crossing from the exited FMN to the triplet state. The characteristic absorption maxima are at 650 and 715 nm <xref rid="pone.0103307-Swartz1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Subsequently the triplet state decays through a neutral radical state <xref rid="pone.0103307-Bauer1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> into the LOV<sub>390</sub> intermediate which is characterized by a covalent bond between the C<sub>4a</sub> of the isoalloxazine ring of FMN and a nearby cysteine residue and an absorption maximum at 390 nm <xref rid="pone.0103307-Swartz1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103307-Kottke1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.

The effector domains can have various functions, e.g. kinase activity, sulfate transporter or transcription factor <xref rid="pone.0103307-Losi2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103307-Crosson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In contrast, the J<sub>&#x003b1;</sub>-helix is not the linker between the two domains of aureochromes <xref rid="pone.0103307-Mitra1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> as the effector domain, here a bZIP domain, is located at the N-terminus. bZIP domains consist of a basic region that is responsible for DNA recognition and a leucine zipper helix. This leucine zipper comprises a leucine residue at each seventh amino acid (minimum three of a kind) and can form a coiled-coil structure <xref rid="pone.0103307-Ellenberger1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103307-Vinson1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

However, the functional mechanism of signal transfer from the blue-light absorbing LOV domain to the downstream bZIP domain has not been explored, yet. In phototropin and YtvA the J<sub>&#x003b1;</sub>-helix, which is a conserved structure element between the LOV and the effector domain, plays a crucial role. Thus, FTIR studies showed that the helix unfold upon illumination, leading to kinase activation <xref rid="pone.0103307-Pfeifer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103307-Pfeifer2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In contrast, STAS domain activation in YtvA probably takes place via light-induced dimerization as shown by SEC and CD <xref rid="pone.0103307-Buttani1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103307-Mglich1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In fact, dimerization and structural changes like &#x003b1;-helical unfolding also seem to play an essential role in the signal transfer of aureochrome 1 as recently shown <xref rid="pone.0103307-Hisatomi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103307-Herman1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However, the blue-light activated dimerization is still under debate. While Herman et al. and Toyooka et al. claim the J<sub>&#x003b1;</sub>-helix to be mandatory for light-induced dimerization of the isolated LOV domain <xref rid="pone.0103307-Toyooka1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103307-Herman1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, Hisatomi et al. observed only monomers of this construct, irrespective of illumination <xref rid="pone.0103307-Hisatomi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. However, all studies agree on the presence of dimers independent of illumination as soon as longer constructs are used, most probably due to disulfide bond formation <xref rid="pone.0103307-Hisatomi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. These results give evidence that light induced dimerization is not the activation step for DNA binding. Furthermore, it is discussed, also for other LOV domains like VVD, that the N-terminal located &#x003b1;-helical cap can replace the J<sub>&#x003b1;</sub>-helix in its function <xref rid="pone.0103307-Zoltowski1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>Here, we describe studies of the photoreaction of full-length aureochrome 1 by time-resolved UV/Vis spectroscopy. The kinetics of the decay of the triplet state as well as of the adduct state were determined. The full-length aureochrome 1 shows a longer life time of the signaling state compared to the isolated LOV domain. Furthermore, light-induced FTIR difference spectroscopy was used to elucidate the influence of binding the target DNA to aureochrome 1 on the photocycle intermediate LOV<sub>390</sub>. We were able to demonstrate interactions of arginine and lysine side chains of aureochrome 1 with the phosphate group of the DNA backbone. Based on homology we propose formation of a Y shaped DNA-aureochrome 1 complex, where the DNA is bound in between the two basic regions of the bZIP domain in the major grove.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Protein Expression and Purification</title><p>A codon optimized synthetic construct (GenScript) of full length aureochrome1 (Uniprot ID: A8QW55) was cloned into pET28a (Novagen) containing an N-terminal 6xHis-tag and a Thrombin cleavage site.

The sequence identity between both LOV domain is 52%. As expected, the two spectra share similarities but detailed inspection reveals crucial differences.

The negative band at 1676 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of dark-state YtvA is absent in the spectrum of aureochrome 1 and the intensity of the positive peak at 1684 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> is decreased. In contrast, the negative band at 1641 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, which is assigned to the &#x003bd;(C&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;C) vibration of ring I of the isoalloxazine moiety <xref rid="pone.0103307-Ataka1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, is more intense than in the YtvA spectrum. We suspect contributions from changes in the amide I band, which are indicative for changes in the secondary structure of aureochrome 1, and overlap with the chromophore mode. Furthermore, the stretching vibration of C<sub>4</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;O<sub>4</sub> oscillates with a frequency of 1712 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, the in-plane bending vibration of N<sub>3</sub>-H at 1374 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and the ring vibration involving mainly &#x003bd;(C<sub>4</sub>-N<sub>3</sub>), &#x003bd;(C<sub>2</sub>-N<sub>3</sub>), &#x003bd;(C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>4a</sub>), &#x003bd;(C<sub>2</sub>-N<sub>1</sub>), &#x003b4;(C<sub>2</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;O<sub>2</sub>) at 1246 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. In aureochrome 1, the atoms O<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>3</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> of ring III of the FMN form hydrogen bonds with the side chains of N286, N296 and Q317, residues that are highly conserved in LOV domains <xref rid="pone.0103307-Mitra1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Thus, the vibrations of ring III are influenced by the strength of the hydrogen bonds. The observed shift by 3 to 5 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to lower wavenumbers corresponds to an increase of the strength of the hydrogen bond network formed with the chromophore.</p><fig id="pone-0103307-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0103307.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>FTIR difference spectrum of aureochrome 1 in the region of 1800 to 1100<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.</title><p>FTIR difference spectrum (light-dark) of aureochrome 1 (top spectrum) recorded under continuous illumination with blue-light (light emitting diode with &#x003bb;<sub>max</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;455 nm).

The latter is known to bind DNA after dimerization of the leucine zipper domain with its basic region at the major grove. By formation of a coiled coil of two helices, a Y shape structure is created that can bind the target DNA by specific interactions of the C-terminal basic region with the DNA, mostly via hydrogen bonds (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103307-g006">Fig.6</xref> left).</p><p>The interaction of DNA and the bZIP domain is reflected in the FTIR difference spectrum (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103307-g006">Fig.6</xref>, lower trace).

Formation of a hydrogen bond to one of the phosphate oxygens leads to strengthening of the double bond character of the other P-O bond.

At the present stage, we are not able to assign the vibrations to specific arginine residues due to the lack of proper point mutants. Additionally, peaks at 1539 and 1630 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric deformation vibration of the NH<sub>3</sub>
<sup>+</sup> group, indicate the involvement of lysine side chains. The rise of these bands reflects the formation of hydrogen bonds between the terminal NH<sub>3</sub>
<sup>+</sup> groups of lysine residues and the P-O<sup>&#x02212;</sup> groups of the phosphate sugar backbones. The increase in intensities of the bands in the amide I and II region that are overlapping with the C&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;O stretching region of the nucleotide bases, are indicative for structural changes of the apoprotein as well as changes in the hydrogen bonded network itself. The structural changes probably include the partially unfolding of the J<sub>&#x003b1;</sub>-helix which was suggested to be involved in the internal signal transduction as concluded from previous FTIR studies <xref rid="pone.0103307-Herman1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Furthermore, a similar reaction mechanism as in EL222 might be valid for aureochrome 1 as well. EL222 consists of a LOV domain that is coupled to an N-terminal HTH domain. In the dark state the DNA binding domain is bound to the &#x003b2;-sheet of the LOV domain <xref rid="pone.0103307-Nash1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. This surface is directly interacting with the FMN chromophore and, consequently, illumination releases the HTH domain which is followed by dimerization and DNA binding. Aureochrome 1 might react in similar way, although the crystal structure of the LOV domain shows that the J<sub>&#x003b1;</sub>-helix is attached loosely to the &#x003b2;-sheet surface <xref rid="pone.0103307-Mitra1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Aureochrome 1 shares high homology with the general control protein (GCN4) from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (PDB entry: 1YSA <xref rid="pone.0103307-Ellenberger1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>) not only in its primary sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103307-g007">Fig. 7</xref>) but also in the sequences of the respective target DNA which is ATGACTCAT for GCN4 and TGACGT for aureochrome 1, respectively.
