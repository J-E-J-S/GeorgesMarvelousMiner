In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, YtvA is part of the stress response complex that is activated under threatening environmental conditions. <xref rid="pone.0107489-Gaidenko1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> When the dark adapted species (YtvAD) is illuminated with blue light, a photocycle is initiated, which proceeds through a triplet state leading in high yield (0.49 <xref rid="pone.0107489-Salomon1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>) to reversible formation of a blue-shifted FMN-cysteine C(4a)-thiol adduct (YtvAL). YtvAL is considered to be the biologically active, signalling state. The photoadduct slowly reverts in the dark to the parental state YtvAD with lifetime ca. 4500 s at 25&#x000b0;C. <xref rid="pone.0107489-Losi2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> This dark relaxation of YtvAL is a thermally activated process with a substantial enthalpic barrier (102 kJ M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and a favorable entropic barrier (31 J K<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Whereas the parental state shows a notable fluorescence (&#x003a6;<sub>fl</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.22), the photoadduct state has lost the fluorescence capacity entirely.</p><p>Photochromicity between two moderately or fully stable states is an intriguing property of many photoreceptors as it implies potential employment of such proteins in biotechnological applications. In that respect, we could recently demonstrate that besides the thermally driven process, illumination of YtvAL with violet or near UV light results in population of YtvAD in appreciable yield (ca. 0.05). <xref rid="pone.0107489-Losi3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> The possibility of switching YtvA between the fluorescent YtvAD state and the non-fluorescent YtvAL state with light of different wavelength opens a variety of applications including super-resolution microscopy with random activation of fluorophores and bidirectional control of the photosensitive actuator <xref rid="pone.0107489-Betzig1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107489-Rust1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107489-Hess1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Clearly, the rate constant for dark relaxation of the photoadduct YtvAL is a parameter of fundamental relevance both for fluorescence imaging studies and for optogenetic applications exploiting the photoswitchable chromophore as a bidirectional actuator.</p><p>However, in view of foreseen applications in cells it appears important to estimate the effect of cellular environment on photocycle rate constants, in particular, as experiments have revealed an extended hydrogen bonding network existing between the flavin chromophore and the surrounding amino acids that over a wide range modulates the thermal recovery kinetics. <xref rid="pone.0107489-Raffelberg1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107489-Raffelberg2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> Moreover, the level of hydration has been shown to affect the latter kinetics in the LOV2 domain of <italic>Avena sativa</italic> phot1 (referred to as <italic>As</italic>LOV2). <xref rid="pone.0107489-Zayner1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> We have thus measured dark recovery kinetics of YtvA in its natural host, <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, and in <italic>E. coli</italic> colonies overexpressing YtvA under different humidity level for the wild type protein (wt) and some mutants that had been identified to be instrumental for the dark recovery process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>E. coli and B. subtilis cultures</title><p>Heterologous expression of wt and mutated YtvA in <italic>E. coli</italic> was performed as described. <xref rid="pone.0107489-Raffelberg2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> Proteins in solution used for these experiments were affinity purified from overexpressing <italic>E. coli</italic> cells employing a His6-tag at their C-terminal end. <xref rid="pone.0107489-Raffelberg2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>

A 150 W Xe arc lamp (LOT-Oriel) was used as excitation source. The white light intensity was modulated with a mechanical chopper (EG&#x00026;G PARC 192) and entered into the epifluorescence excitation port through a fiber bundle. A filter cube allowed to excite the fluorescence emission by 390 nm light (Thorlabs MF390-18 excitation filter, Thorlabs MD416 Dichroic Filter) and collect fluorescence emission by YtvA through a suitable emission filter (Thorlabs MF525-39). The intensity modulated wide field fluorescence emission (collected over a &#x0223c;1 mm diameter area) was detected by a single channel photometer (model 814, PTI). The voltage output was fed into a dual channel lock-in amplifier (EG&#x00026;G PARC, 5208) which allowed to efficiently reject the noise. The retrieved DC amplitude was recorded on a computer using a signal acquisition board (National Instruments 6013). Finally, actinic beams at 465 nm (LED456) and 405 nm (LED405) were entered through the bottom port of the microscope (see reference <xref rid="pone.0107489-Losi3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> for spectral characteristics).

<italic>E. coli</italic> cells overexpressing YtvA were withdrawn from the Petri dish and placed on a microscope glass plate. By this preparation, the cells were exposed to air and kept in the dark for 1 hour. Irradiation of cells, prepared in this manner (i.e., fully adapted in its YtvAD state) by blue light (LED465), leads to reduction of the fluorescence emission from YtvAD due to the formation of the non-fluorescent adduct state YtvAL. When the blue light was turned off and cells were kept in the dark, fluorescence emission intensity increased with time, as a consequence of the thermal relaxation to YtvAD. This process is similar to the well characterized behavior of the purified protein, kept in buffer of given pH and salt concentration. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107489-g001">Figure 1A</xref> shows several subsequent dark relaxation kinetics following illumination cycles of the cell culture (duration 5 minutes, blue bars at the bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107489-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). In these experiments it was not possible to monitor the (forward) photoconversion of YtvAD to YtvAL upon LED465 illumination since the detection system was saturated by the fluorescence emission excited by the intense actinic beam. The kinetics of the dark relaxation is quite reproducible from cycle to cycle, with some loss (&#x0223c;10%) in the fluorescence emission level attained upon recovery of YtvAD. It remains to be established whether this is due to some partial irreversible bleaching of the photoreceptor or to lack of complete recovery on the accessible time scale of our experiment, which is difficult to extend beyond &#x0223c;10<sup>4</sup> s. Control experiments on <italic>E. coli</italic> colonies expressing the C62S YtvA mutant, for which the photocycle is inhibited, showed no modulation of the fluorescence intensity upon illumination (data not shown), thus demonstrating that the observed cyclic effect is indeed related to the photochemistry of the expressed photoreceptor. As a further control, the fluorescence emission intensity from <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures, which were not transformed to express YtvA, was detected and found to be at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the level observed for transformed bacteria.</p><fig id="pone-0107489-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0107489.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Dark recovery kinetics of YtvAL to YtvAD.</title><p>

R63 is part of an extended HB network that involves the terminal phosphate of FMN and Asp36 and is directly succeeding the reactive cysteine (C62). <xref rid="pone.0107489-Mglich1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> Substitution with a lysine is expected to partially destroy this network and to induce local structural changes, possibly by clamping the lysine lateral chain to the ribityl chain of the flavin. The role of this residue has been poorly investigated, but the corresponding mutation in phot-LOV1 from <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> (R58K) also shortens the recovery lifetime from 200 s to ca. 70 s at 20&#x000b0;C <xref rid="pone.0107489-Losi4" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>Given that the rate limiting step of splitting the covalent bond between FMN and protein in the photoadduct is suggested to be base-catalyzed by water, <xref rid="pone.0107489-Alexandre2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107489-Laan1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> i.e., should be initiated by a proton abstraction from N(5), <xref rid="pone.0107489-SilvaJunior1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> it is hardly imaginable that the effects of R63K on the recovery kinetics relating to hydration level of cells, rely on this process. In the absence of structural information, we do not have a definite answer but it can be suggested that, at least in this case, conformational/structural effects are predominant. Given that this mutation does not impair protein stability <xref rid="pone.0107489-Losi4" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> or interdomain signaling, <xref rid="pone.0107489-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> it could be exerted for other LOV proteins, both in vitro and in vivo and also might be considered as an important factor for structural investigations.</p><p>The faster dark relaxation of YtvAL to YtvAD observed within <italic>E. coli</italic> cells has profound implications for cellular applications of flavin binding LOV domains. We have recently presented YtvA as a genetically encoded fluorescent probe for super-resolution microscopy based on random activation of single molecules. In particular we reported Fluorescence Photo-Activation Localization Microscopy (FPALM) studies of live <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, expressing YtvA molecules, thus demonstrating the photoswitching properties of YtvA in living cells <xref rid="pone.0107489-Losi3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>In FPALM, molecules are normally kept in their light adapted, non-fluorescent state, and fluorescence from individual molecules is activated by exposing the sample to a suitable laser source of low intensity. In our application we found necessary to apply a continuously running laser source emitting at 488 nm to inhibit build-up of an appreciable population of fluorescent molecules through dark relaxation. <xref rid="pone.0107489-Losi3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> This fact was at odds with the very slow dark relaxation observed for YtvA in solution, suggesting that once photoconverted to YtvAL, the molecules should remain in their non-fluorescent state for very long times, inconsistent with the observation of fast recovery of the fluorescent state YtvAD.</p><p>The shorter dark recovery time may have consequences for optogenetic applications of actuators based on the flavin binding LOV domains as photosensitive elements, if the physiologically active state confers to a light-induced enzyme activity or similar. Due to the cellular environment, the biologically active, light adapted state will have a shorter persistence and thus allow a faster recovery of the inactive state. This is a relevant property that could be exploited to tailor the recovery kinetics to specific needs, in view of the prospected wide range of optogenetic applications of LOV domains <xref rid="pone.0107489-MottaMena1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107489-Pathak1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107489-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p><p>It is thus worth considering that the observed change in rate constants may be rationalized also in a different perspective. When co-solutes are present at high concentrations, as inside a living cell, the volume available for diffusion of reactants participating in a chemical reaction is dramatically reduced due to the mutual impenetrability of all solute molecules. This effect is often referred to as molecular crowding. <xref rid="pone.0107489-Ellis1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107489-Ellis2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107489-Minton1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> Effects of crowding on biochemical reaction rates are complex, because although crowding reduces diffusion, it increases thermodynamic activities. For a transition-state-limited reaction, crowding is expected to increase the rate constant because crowding increases the activity. This argument appears relevant also in view of our previous FPALM studies on live <italic>E. coli</italic> cells overexpressing YtvA, demonstrating preferential allocation of the protein in the membrane regions of the bacteria. <xref rid="pone.0107489-Losi3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> At present it is unclear whether this location is due to its interactions with proteins similar to those naturally occurring in the stressosome of <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, or to artifactual accumulation inside inclusion bodies. In any event, a dense packing into multicomponent assemblies is expected to lead to substantial molecular crowding effect which may account for the observed changes in the measured rate constants.</p><p>Further studies under strictly controlled water content conditions on purified proteins and in the presence of crowding agents will yield a more quantitative connection between the observed effect and hydration of the protein. Furthermore, a possible role of the specific ions in the salts used to stabilize the pH and define the ionic strength cannot be ruled out at this stage and will be also the subject of future investigations.</p><p>The complex kinetics observed for purified YtvA proteins dried on a glass plate with respect to buffer solutions can be compared to the results obtained with <italic>As</italic>LOV2 under similar conditions, for which removal of water causes a significant increase in the recovery lifetime, raising from 80 s to 1726 s at 22&#x000b0;C. <xref rid="pone.0107489-Zayner1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> For this system, several lines of evidence have suggested that formation of the adduct induces a conformational change concomitant with an increased solvent accessibility, and that water may catalyze N5 deprotonation and splitting of the covalent bond. Nevertheless this might not be the sole effect of water on LOV domain dynamics, as it has been observed that de-hydration impairs the large light-induced conformational changes centered on the &#x003b2;-sheet of the LOV core. <xref rid="pone.0107489-Alexandre1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> FTIR studies demonstrated that light-induced conformational changes of the LOV core seem to be sequential after formation of the adduct, with one intermediate that could be trapped at low hydration levels. <xref rid="pone.0107489-Alexandre1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> Catalytic activity of water on covalent bond splitting and water-assisted conformational changes during the photocycle might exert opposite effects on the recovery kinetics, in that a conformational intermediate trapped at low hydration levels would most probably have a higher energy content, thus lowering the activation barrier. Further studies will aim at characterizing the light-induced protein conformational changes of YtvA at different levels of hydration.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank U.
