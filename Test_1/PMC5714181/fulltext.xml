To date, several optogenetic tools have been developed in order to control and/or monitor mammalian transcription (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), enzyme function (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), protein translocation (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), receptor tyrosine kinase activity (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and neuronal activity (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In order to develop an optogenetic tool that maintains a minimal background interaction in the dark, we previously developed a system using the light-induced binding of FKF1 (Flavin-binding, Kelch-repeat, F-box 1) to GIGANTEA (GI) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Flavin mononucleotide, a chromophore of the FKF1 family, is known to form a covalent bond with a cysteine residue on a light, oxygen or voltage (LOV) domain in FKF1, leading to interaction with GI upon blue-light exposure. Using a G128D variant of FKF1 family molecule ZEITLUPE (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), we demonstrated light-dependent regulation of a split Gal4-VP16 transcriptional system in mammalian cells (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The FKF1/GI-based system was used in further applications (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, the induction of transcription using the existing FKF1/GI systems with light was modest (3- to 5-fold), such that it was not practical for application <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here we describe an optimized FKF1/GI transcriptional system using a newly identified mutant (H105L) and a single vector construct, which shows &#x0223c;300-fold induction with blue light. In addition, we have also optimized the CRY2/CIB1-based light-inducible transcription (&#x0223c;100-fold induction with blue light). When compared with other existing optogenetic approaches such as CRY2/CIB1 to regulate transcription, this system using FKF1/GI is unique in showing a long-lived transcriptional response to a single pulse of light and extremely low background activity in the dark.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells (ATCC, #CRL-3216) and NIH 3T3 cells (ATCC, #CRL-1658) were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM, Invitrogen #10313021) supplemented with 1% GlutaMax I and 100 unit/ml penicillin and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin (P.S., all reagents from Life Technologies) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, not heat-inactivated, HyClone, #SH30071.03, Thermo Scientific) under normoxia (20% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, at 37&#x000b0;C) using HERAcell (Thermo Scientific).

Therefore, we carried out the subsequent experiments with this new DNA ratio to summarize the results using optimized FKF1/GI- and CRY2/CIB1-based system.</p><p>To test the reversibility of both systems, we exposed the cells to either 6 h of illumination cycles followed by 6 h of darkness or a 30-min illumination followed by 23.5 h in the dark (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">H</xref>). From these experiments, we found that the FKF1 system did not show any significant decrease in induction while the CRY2/CIB1 system had a significantly less induction when kept in the dark after stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">J</xref>). Next, we tested the dependence of each system to the amount of light to which the cells were exposed. This was accomplished by decreasing the illumination length of each cycle in Protocol B to 8 and 2 s illumination with 72 and 78 s of darkness, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8F and G</xref>). FKF1/GI was not affected by the decrease from 20 to 8 s illumination but was detrimentally affected by the decrease to 2 s (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8H</xref>). CRY2/CIB1, on the other hand, showed a significant decrease in induction when decreasing the illumination times to 8 and 2 s (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8I</xref>).</p><p>To assess these optogenetic systems outside of the Luc assay, we used a Gal4 UAS-dsGFP reporter and gauged their activity through western blot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4K</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">L</xref>). Here, the data demonstrates that the CRY2/CIB1 system has a significantly higher increase in dsGFP expression as compared with FKF1/GI. In addition, we used FACS to quantify the expression of Gal4 UAS-dsGFP in various mammalian cells: HEK 293T cells, human patient skin primary fibroblasts and NIH 3T3 cells as controlled by each system (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4M</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">N</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). From this test, we found that the there was no difference in HEK 293T cells for either system while the expression of CRY2/CIBI had a higher population of cells expressing dsGFP in human fibroblasts and NIH 3T3 cells.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-7"><title>Further biological applications of the FKF1/GI-based system <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>We were interested in testing the utility of the FKF1/GI system in controlling the expression of transcription factors. A recent publication noted that Sox9 is an important regulator in the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells to cholangiocytes (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Therefore we tested whether the FKF1/GI system can increase the expression of Sox9 in HEK 293T cells. To do this, we expressed Gal4 UAS- Sox9 and illuminated the cells following protocol B. These experiments showed that the FKF1/GI system is capable of a significant induction of Sox9 expression in this system (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">C</xref>). To validate light-induced Sox9 expression with light further, we conducted quantitative RT-PCR and observed significantly increased expressions of Sox9 target genes such as Aggrecan, LXH2, GAS1 and TLE4 in the illuminated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). These results reveal that the improved FKF1/GI-based system is capable of light-dependent induction of target gene expressions in mammalian cells.</p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>

Using a hydrodynamic tail vein (HTV) injection method (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), we transiently transduced Gal4DBD-NLOV (H105L) and GI-VP64 in live mouse livers. Twelve hours after the HTV injection, the abdomen of the transfected mice were exposed to blue light. Because the binding of NLOV (H105) to GI is irreversible, we used a LED array for one-shot illumination (3 min) and then returned the mice to their darkened cages. We found that the livers of illuminated mice expressed GFP 12 h after illumination while no expression of GFP proteins was detected in mice kept in the dark.

These results demonstrate that the FKF1/GI-based transcription system is functional in <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse models.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="SEC4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here, we describe an improved system for the spatiotemporal control of transcription in mammalian cells with light, based on the interaction between FKF1/GI. To do this, we conducted random mutagenesis of FKF1 (NLOV fragment), optimized the fusion constructs and compared this improved system with other existing tools that ultimately allowed us to improve transcription control with light in mammalians without a significant increase in unwanted background leak. Based on the results of mutagenesis and optimization of NLOV and GI constructs fused with Gal4DBD and VP16, we concluded that the H105L mutation in Gal4DBD-NLOV with GI-VP16 is a significantly improved version of the FKF1/GI-based system for light-induced transcription in mammalians.</p><p>Of note, using a homology model of the LOV domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S10B</xref>), it is apparent that H105 is located in a highly flexible loop (99&#x02013;107aa), which was determined to be essential for NLOV binding to GI (data not shown). Interestingly, this loop is unique to the FKF1 family (FKF1, ZEITLUPE and LKP2) compared to other LOV domain-containing molecules. In the previous study, we found that the loop alone did not bind GI (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). On the other hand, the previous mutation G128D is located in the beta-sheet binding cleft of the protein. Due to its location, the H105L mutation may affect the location of the flexible loop. One potential possibility is that it is bound to the binding cleft before the cysteinyl bond is established. Once this bond is formed, the loop may be released from the domain's binding cleft and allowed to bind GI. This sequestration of this integral loop may explain the extremely low background of the mutant. Unexpectedly, another mutant hit #119 contains the H105R mutation, which also demonstrates slightly improved Luc induction (7.9&#x000d7;) compared to the G128D mutant (4.8&#x000d7;) in the tested NLOV-VP16 construct with GI-Gal4DBD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). These results suggest that the H105 residue in the loop could be crucial for FKF1 binding to GI. However, the mechanism by which the H105L mutation improved the light-inducible systems remained unclear. To begin to address this concern, we compared the fold-induction of Luc using the H105L and G128D mutations in Gal4DBD-NLOV with GI-VP16. We found that the H105L mutation reduced the basal background leak in the dark and increased on/off kinetics more than the G128D mutation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">H</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the double mutant (G128D and H105L) showed no induction with light as compared to the H105L mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S10C and D</xref>). Further computational simulations and structural biophysical experiments should be required to unveil the mechanism underlying light-dependent binding of FKF1 to GI.</p><p>In this study, the NLOV/GI split construct and illumination optimizations were also essential for improving the FKF1/GI-based light-inducible transcription in mammalian cells. Therefore, when we used the optimized constructs and illumination (Protocol B), we found that there was no difference in Luc induction between VP16 and VP64 constructs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S10E</xref>). In addition to the FKF1/GI-based system, we then optimized the CRY2/CIB1 system, using similar strategies for split construct, transfection and illumination optimizations. The optimized CRY2/CIB1 system showed a comparable induction of firefly Luc with the FKF1/GI (H105L). When the Luc signal with light is normalized to dark, we found an increase of &#x0223c;100-fold. Of note, the CRY2/CIB1 system had a consistently higher light-dependent induction with a notable amount of leakiness as shown by the higher Luc signal in dark compared to the FKF1/GI-based system. This may make the CRY2/CIB1 a more attractive option in systems where a higher amount of transcription induction is required with spatiotemporal control.</p><p>For further improvement of the FKF1/GI-based system, we examined whether single vector constructs containing both FKF1 and GI constructs improves gene transduction compared to co-transfection of the FKF1 and GI plasmids. Interestingly, we found that the new IRES constructs demonstrated &#x0003e;200-fold induction of Luc with light while the 2A peptide-containing constructs did not work (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary 11A</xref>). The best IRES-based single construct (FLAG-GI-VP16-IRES-Gal4DBD-NLOV H105L-HA) showed significantly improved induction with light (&#x0223c;292-fold) compared to the former results using co-transfection of two plasmids (&#x0223c;94-fold, Gal4DBD-NLOV H105L-HA and FLAG-GI-VP16). Using the new IRES construct, we performed light-induced <italic>Myod1</italic> expression in MEF because <italic>Myod1</italic> overexpression could induce trans-differentiation of MEF into myoblasts (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). We confirm that illumination could increase the expressions of Luc reporter and <italic>Myod1</italic> transcripts in MEF using the new IRES-based plasmid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S11B and C</xref>). Also, we observed Myod1 protein expression and morphological changes of MEF following Protocol B illumination after 5 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S11D</xref>). These results demonstrate further evidence that our improved FKF1/GI-based system is capable of light-induced transcription that is used for biological applications.</p><p>One of the key features of the FKF1/GI-based system is the non-reversible interaction of FKF1 with GI upon stimulation with light (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) while other systems such as CRY2/CIB1 are reversible (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Unlike the CRY2/CIB1 system, the FKF1/GI system does not require continuous exposure of live cells to light, which could reduce the potential phototoxic effects of blue light unlike the CRY2/CIB1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">J</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8A and B</xref>). Tucker and colleagues described that the performance of a given optogenetic tool is dependent on the system in which the study is conducted (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Thus, side-by-side comparisons&#x02014;even if well intended as certainly the case in this study&#x02014;could be challenging. Therefore, further optimizations of construct and transduction for the EL222 and VVD systems may improve the background leak in dark conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). The low background signal consistently seen in the FKF1/GI-based system will enable the wider application of this system, including its use in target cells to address developmental questions with fine spatiotemporal resolution. In the case of the CRY2/CIB1-based system, the background leak in the dark became worse later after the transfection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">D</xref>). This result suggests that it might be difficult to develop biological models such as transgenic mouse stably expressing the CRY2/CIB1 constructs. Therefore, the new version of the light-inducible transcription system using FKF1 (NLOV, H105L) and GI will be of great interest to many researchers for use in further applications of this FKF1/GI-based system with their biological models and to address their questions regarding basic and biomedical research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="gkx804_supp.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We would like to thank C.
