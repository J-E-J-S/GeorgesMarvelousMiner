The perception of light is realized by a flavin chromophore that upon illumination reversibly switches from the non-covalently bound dark-state to a covalently linked flavin-LOV adduct. It is usually assumed that most LOV domains preferably bind FMN, but heterologous expression frequently results in the incorporation of all natural occurring flavins, i.e. riboflavin, FMN and FAD. Over recent years, the structures, photochemical properties, activation mechanisms and physiological functions of a multitude of LOV proteins have been studied intensively, but little is known about its affinities to physiologically relevant flavins or the thermodynamics of the flavin-LOV interaction. We have investigated the interaction of the LOV domain of the well characterized bacterial photoreceptor YtvA with riboflavin, FMN and FAD by ITC experiments providing binding constants and thermodynamic profiles of these interactions. For this purpose, we have developed a protocol for the production of the apo forms of YtvA and its isolated LOV domain and we demonstrate that the latter can be used as a molecular probe for free flavins in cell lysates. Furthermore, we show here using NMR spectroscopic techniques and Analytical Ultracentrifugation that the flavin moiety stabilizes the conformation of the LOV domain and that dimerization of YtvA is caused not only by intermolecular LOV-LOV but also by STAS-STAS contacts.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), Grant SCHM880/8-1.

The processes controlled in a light-dependent manner vary from transcription to movement of chloroplasts and phototaxis [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In a variety of blue light sensing photoreceptors flavin binding LOV (light, oxygen, voltage) and BLUF (blue light sensing using FAD) domains act as versatile photochromic switches servicing multiple effector domains [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Over recent years, the structures, photochemical properties, activation mechanisms and physiological functions of a multitude of LOV and BLUF proteins have been studied intensively [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], but little is known about its affinities to physiologically relevant flavins or the thermodynamics of the flavin-LOV interaction. This kind of knowledge could, however, be useful to assess the often unknown physiological chromophore composition of LOV photoreceptors in vivo. LOV domains share a common fold with the protein backbone comprising four &#x003b1;-helices and an anti-parallel beta-sheet with two of the four &#x003b1;-helices running parallel to it. The flavin chromophore is bound in a deep cleft with the isoalloxazine ring pointing towards the beta-sheet and the ribityl chain being sandwiched by the two &#x003b1;-helices [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is assumed that BLUF domains preferably bind FAD [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and most LOV domains preferably bind FMN [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Heterologous expression of both domains frequently results in mixtures of all natural occurring flavins, i.e. riboflavin (RF), FMN and FAD [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Hence, the flavin composition seems to depend on the expression system (i.e. bacteria, fungi or insect cells), the expression conditions (i.e. media, temperature, duration) and, finally, the characteristics of the domain itself.</p><p>The LOV domain of WC-1, for example, isolated from <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> contains exclusively FAD [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], whereas the heterologously expressed LOV protein Vivid, from the same organism, binds both FAD and FMN with ratios varying from 0.5 to 1 depending on the purified batch [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In contrast, LOV domains of heterologously expressed <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> phototropin-1 and LOV1 of <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> phototropin were found to contain exclusively FMN [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This suggests that some LOV domains can interact with different flavins, while others seem to be specific for a particular flavin type.</p><p>An inspection of several LOV structures (see <xref rid="pone-0081268-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) provides no general explanation why certain domains have different flavin specificities with the exception of two FAD-binding domains. The Vivid LOV domain (PDB-ID: 2PD7), despite its high similarity to the phototropin-like LOV domains, is the only known LOV structure containing FAD. It possesses an extended loop (between the two conserved &#x003b1;-helices mentioned above) which accommodates the adenosine moiety of FAD at the protein surface [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The additional polar interaction between the pyrophosphate of FAD and the side-chain of a lysine within that loop most likely enhances the affinity for FAD. This is supported by the fact, that a similar loop-extension is also present in the FAD binding LOV domain of WC-1 [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="pone-0081268-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0081268.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Selection of available LOV structures.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col span="1"/><col span="1"/><col span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">

YtvA is involved in the general stress response pathway of the common soil bacterium <italic>B. subtilis</italic> [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and was recently shown to be permanently associated with the bacterial stressosome [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is a ~60 kDa homodimer possessing a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) below 300 nM [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and each subunit consists of an N-terminal phototropin-like LOV domain and a C-terminal STAS (sulphate transporter / antisigma factor antagonist) domain linked to each other by a helical amino acid sequence, denoted J&#x003b1;-helix. The protein adopts a dumbbell shape, with LOV-LOV and STAS-STAS interactions on either side [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The structure of its LOV domain (aa 21-147) was published in 2007 and it was shown that this truncated construct is also dimeric, with a K<sub>D</sub> below 200 nM [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>YtvA and its LOV domain are, upon heterologous expression in <italic>E. coli</italic>, predominantly associated with FMN ([<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and this work), but recently it was demonstrated, that YtvA is also able to incorporate RF, FMN, FAD and two synthetic flavin derivatives during a refolding procedure [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Here we present a protocol for the preparation of the apo form of both YtvA and its isolated LOV domain. Both can be completely reconstituted with different flavins and we provide thermodynamic profiles and binding constants of the interactions of the LOV domain with RF, FMN and FAD using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC). Based on data from Analytical Ultracentrifugation (AUC) and solution-state NMR spectroscopy, we show that the chromophore stabilizes the global fold and quaternary structure of the protein. Beyond that, we demonstrate that the deflavinated LOV domain can be used as a flavin-specific molecular probe for the determination of the relative flavin composition of cell lysates and we provide an explanation for the varying flavin compositions of heterologously expressed LOV proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Protein constructs and naming conventions</title><p>For the investigation presented here two constructs of YtvA have been used, the full length protein (aa 1 &#x02013; 261) which we call YtvA and an extended version of the LOV domain (aa 1 &#x02013; 128) which we call YLOV. If the proteins are expressed heterologously in <italic>E. coli</italic> they mainly contain FMN and up to 11 % RF. The latter can be replaced with a large molar excess of FMN under native conditions (i.e. without unfolding of the protein, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081268.s009">Protocol S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081268.s001">Figure S1</xref> in the supplementary material for further details) in both YtvA and YLOV. We call the proteins thus obtained E.coli-YtvA and E.coli-YLOV. Using the protocol described below it is possible to remove the chromophore and refold the protein in absence of any flavin, yielding Apo-YtvA and Apo-YLOV. Subsequent reintroduction of a RF, FMN or FAD, leads to RF-YtvA, FMN-YtvA and FAD-YtvA, respectively, similar names will be used for YLOV. A backbone NMR assignment has been obtained for both E.coli-YtvA [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and E.coli-YLOV.</p></sec><sec id="s2.2"><title>Preparation of apoproteins</title><p>Several strategies for the chromophore exchange in flavoproteins and flavin binding BLUF and LOV domains have been presented: The chromophore release is typically based on either a lowering of pH to about 4 [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], sometimes combined with supplementation of high concentrations of KBr [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], or denaturation using urea or guanidinium chloride [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Reconstitution of the apoproteins is subsequently achieved by refolding or regeneration of physiological conditions in the presence of the desired flavins. In most cases, the intermediate apoproteins are quite unstable and therefore not suitable for further studies.</p><p>It has been shown, however, that flavins in the heterologously expressed BLUF domain of AppA from <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic> are exchangeable under native conditions [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This is also true for YtvA and YLOV and since the flavin is exchangeable without unfolding the protein, we assumed that Apo-YtvA and Apo-YLOV are stable in solution.</p><p>Modified versions of the protocols employed by Eisenreich et al. [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and Mansurova et al. [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] were used to remove the bound flavins quantitatively from E.coli-YtvA and E.coli-YLOV, the major difference being the concentration of urea used for protein denaturation, which was set to 6.5 M. The resulting apoproteins were subsequently refolded under reducing conditions (1 mM DTT) in absence of any flavin. Both apoproteins were soluble and absence of the typical flavin absorption within its UV-VIS spectra indicated a complete removal of the chromophore (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081268.s002">Figure S2</xref> in the supplementary material).</p></sec><sec id="s2.3"><title>NMR-spectroscopy of apoproteins</title><p>To obtain information on the overall fold of the apoproteins two-dimensional <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N correlation spectra (<sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-TROSYs) of uniformly <sup>15</sup>N-labeled Apo-YLOV and uniformly <sup>2</sup>H-,<sup>15</sup>N-labeled Apo-YtvA were recorded and compared with corresponding spectra of the holoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081268-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0081268-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0081268.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Superposition of <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N-TROSY spectra of native and apo form of YtvA and YLOV.</title><p>(A) <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N-TROSY spectra of E.coli-YtvA (black) and Apo-YtvA (red).

Loss of the chromophore leads, however, to shifts of various resonances. Using the resonance assignment of E.coli-YtvA [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], those resonances can be identified but since no assignment of Apo-YtvA is available, the changes in chemical shift cannot be quantified. Inspection of well resolved, non-overlapping resonances suggest that predominantly signals of amino acids of the LOV domain (aa 21 to 126) are affected, while resonances of the STAS domain (aa 148 to 261) remain largely unperturbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081268-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, and enlarged in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081268.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The absence of the flavin moiety obviously alters the chemical environment of at least 56 residues throughout the whole LOV domain. The resonance frequencies of some of these residues seem to be shifted far from its original values. Moreover, a significant number of resonances have disappeared indicating a line-broadening of the affected signals caused by a change in conformational dynamics.</p><p>Except for S<sup>147</sup>, all other evaluable resonances of the J&#x003b1;-helix (aa 127 to 147) have disappeared, indicating that this structural element is likewise in conformational exchange. In contrast, resonances of the very C-terminal J&#x003b1;-residue (S<sup>147</sup>) and its succeeding amino acids (T<sup>148</sup> to V<sup>151</sup>, G<sup>156</sup>) are not affected or only slightly shifted suggesting that this region has a structure similar to that in E.coli-YtvA. Most of the remaining resonances of the STAS domain that can be analysed (51 out of 101 residues) are hardly affected exhibiting chemical shift differences less than the line-widths. In addition, the signal pattern resembles that in E.coli-YtvA and we therefore assume that the structure of the STAS domain is fully recovered during the refolding process.</p><p>The superposition of the <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N correlation spectra of E.coli-YLOV and Apo-YLOV shows that, except for the central region, nearly all characteristic E.coli-YLOV resonances are absent or very weak for the apoprotein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081268-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Analogous to Apo-YtvA this suggests that the protein is in conformational exchange, but the somewhat larger signal overlap in the central region of the spectrum could also hint at structural disorder. Assuming that Apo-YLOV and particularly its central beta-sheet were unstructured, there would be no structural basis for a dimer interface (as it is present in flavin containing YLOV [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]) which would result in monomeric Apo-YLOV. Therefore, we analysed the oligomerization state using analytical ultracentrifugation.</p></sec><sec id="s2.4"><title>Analytical Ultracentrifugation Experiments</title><p>Sedimentation velocity (SV) experiments performed for Apo-YLOV at concentrations of 17.5, 35 and 70 &#x003bc;M, displayed sedimentation profiles characteristic for a self-associating species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081268-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). At the lowest loading concentration the c(S) distribution appears as a broad and extensively tailed single peak with a weight-averaged apparent sedimentation coefficient (S<sub>wapp</sub>) of 1.94 S. The pronounced peak tailing already suggests the presence of two differently sized species with the smaller one dominating quantitatively. Due to the low S/N ratio and the correspondingly poor resolution the ratio is difficult to assess. Two individual peaks are observable with increasing concentration, the relative amount of the larger species is increasing and the S<sub>wapp</sub> of the major peak shifts slightly towards higher values. Either is indicative for a self-associating system [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. For the 70 &#x000b5;M sample, the best-fit weight-averaged frictional ratio (f/f0), which was determined iteratively from spreading of the sedimentation boundary, is 1.24 and the S<sub>wapp</sub> of the smaller and the larger species is 1.58 S and 2.52 S, respectively. The apparent molecular weight (MW) approximated from the frictional ratio and the sedimentation coefficients is 11.4 kDa for the smaller and 22.8 kDa for the larger species. Given a calculated theoretical MW of 14.5 kDa for monomeric Apo-YLOV, this indicates a monomer-dimer equilibrium. Homogeneity amounted to more than 95% for the observed species and higher oligomers were not present in significant amounts. The approximated MWs of both species are significant lower than expected. This is caused by an underestimated frictional ratio, which is not unusual for self-associating systems, because spreading of the sedimentation boundary is affected not only by diffusion, but also by the reaction kinetics [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The examined concentration range, as well as the low size difference between the monomer and the dimer do not allow any precise assumption about the dissociation constant. Derived from the c(S) distribution of the 70 &#x000b5;M sample, 27.1% of Apo-YLOV is monomeric and 72.9% is associated in dimers, which corresponds to a binding constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of about 14 &#x000b5;M, but since the peaks are not completely baseline-separated, this K<sub>D</sub> is only an estimate. Sedimentation equilibrium (SE) experiments for determination of a more exact binding constant yielded no meaningful results, most likely due to the instability of Apo-YLOV over the long time course needed for SE experiments.</p><fig id="pone-0081268-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0081268.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>c(S)-Distributions obtained for Apo-YLOV and Apo-YtvA revealing a change in oligomerization behaviour.</title><p>Sedimentation velocity (SV) experiments were performed at 45,000 rpm and sedimentation was followed at 280 nm.

A c(S) distribution derived from the lowest loading concentration of 15 &#x000b5;M shows a single peak with S<sub>wapp</sub> of 3.6 S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081268-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, red line). The molecular weight approximated from that value and the best-fit f/f0 (1.45) is 61.1 kDa, which clearly points to a dimeric state of the protein. This finding indicates a K<sub>D</sub> for self-dimerization on the order of at least 1 magnitude lower than the loading concentration [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Interestingly, at higher loading concentrations an additional small peak is observable at 2.1 S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081268-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, green and black lines). The MW of the corresponding species is 29.2 kDa, which points to a monomeric form of Apo-YtvA. Since its relative amount of about 7% is invariant with respect to the loading concentration, this species represents most likely an incorrectly folded fraction of Apo-YtvA not able to dimerize.</p><p>Even though our AUC data derived for Apo-YLOV shows that loss of the chromophore reduces the K<sub>D</sub> of the LOV-LOV self-dimerization by at least 2 orders of magnitude, Apo-YtvA still exists almost exclusively as a dimer in the concentration range analysed here. This can be explained by an additional interaction between the STAS domains. As we showed previously, this interaction is weak (~350 &#x000b5;M) [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], but in combination with the weakened LOV-LOV interaction this results in a higher total affinity. The tighter binding between the Apo-YtvA monomers is therefore the result of a bivalent binding pattern, suggesting that the structure of the STAS domains and the intra-molecular STAS-STAS interactions were restored in the refolding process as was already indicated by our NMR data.</p></sec><sec id="s2.5"><title>Affinity of the YtvA-LOV domain for RF, FMN, and FAD</title><p>It has been demonstrated that some flavin binding photoreceptors including YtvA are able to incorporate natural as well as artificial or chemically modified flavins like roseoflavins in vivo and in vitro [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

Based on the crystal structure of the YtvA LOV domain [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], the latter can be explained by the fact that the flavin moiety fits well into the binding pocket while the adenosine part would move freely outside of the protein.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0081268-t002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0081268.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Results of the ITC experiments performed with Apo-YLOV.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col span="1"/><col span="1"/><col span="1"/><col span="1"/><col span="1"/><col span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Light induced formation of the covalent adduct, the initial step within the photocycle of all LOV domains [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], is characterized by a decrease of typical flavin absorption at wavelengths larger than 410 nm and by a 60 nm hypsochromic shift of the 450 nm flavin absorption maximum after illumination. Subsequent analysis of corresponding UV-Vis spectra reveals that this applies to all reconstituted YLOV variants (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081268.s005">Figure S5</xref> in the supplementary material).</p></sec><sec id="s2.7"><title>NMR of reconstituted LOV domains</title><p>To test whether the exchange of the chromophore has an influence on the thermal recovery of the ground state, we determined the rate of recovery for all reconstituted proteins by tracking intensity changes of two distinct signals within pseudo-2D <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081268.s006">Figure S6</xref> for details).

Interestingly and in line with other results [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], the absence of the phosphate group in RF accelerates the photocycle by about 30% compared to FMN and FAD. This observation can be explained by an altered hydrogen-bonding pattern of residues surrounding the terminal hydroxyl group of RF. Since it has been suggested that recovery of the ground state is a base-catalysed reaction involving proton-transfer steps, modifications of the chromophore associated hydrogen-bonding network would indeed increase or decrease the recovery rate constant [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].

A comparison between the <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-TROSYs from FMN-YLOV and FAD-YLOV shows that about 30 cross-peaks are extremely weak or have completely disappeared and that most of the remaining signals are notably diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081268-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).

The most likely explanation is the presence of intermediate exchange with respect to the NMR timescale. This also applies to residues F<sup>7</sup> and G<sup>11</sup> to I<sup>16</sup> of the N-terminus. Only 10 residues distributed throughout the whole sequence (D<sup>31</sup>, G<sup>51</sup>, K<sup>60</sup>, F<sup>64</sup>, H<sup>69</sup>, K<sup>97</sup>, D<sup>109</sup>, E<sup>112</sup>, T<sup>117</sup> and Q<sup>123</sup>) show pronounced chemical shift differences (CSD &#x0003e; 0.025 ppm). Beside the central beta-sheet, FAD exchange mainly affects structural elements opposite to the dimer interface and within the Ncap-sequence. So it seems likely that the adenosine moiety dynamically interacts with residues of these regions. Such additional weak interactions could also be an explanation for the slightly higher affinity of FAD.</p><p>Since the residues coordinating the ribityl chain and the phosphate group of FMN are highly conserved in phototropin and phototropin-like LOV domains (aa N<sup>61</sup>, R<sup>63</sup>, Q<sup>66</sup> and R<sup>79</sup> in YtvA) [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], binding specificity of YLOV for FMN, RF and FAD presented in this work should be comparable to other phot-like LOV domains. This is also supported by the fact, that the backbones of the LOV structures given in <xref rid="pone-0081268-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> are extremely similar and do not provide any explanations whether certain domains could have different flavin specificities.

Testing the physiological chromophore composition, however, is not trivial, since purification of the desired endogenous protein from its source organism is required. Knowledge of a receptor&#x02019;s affinity for the natural occurring flavins combined with information on the absolute cytosolic concentrations of these flavins in the source cell it should allow an estimate of physiological chromophore composition in vivo. Unfortunately, absolute cytosolic flavin concentrations are also not easily obtained [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In contrast, use of affinity-tagged Apo-YLOV could provide a simple method for an indirect determination of the chromophore composition and was tested here for YtvA in wild-type <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> cells.</p><p>We used the lysate derived from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells in the stationary phase. In a HPLC-based analysis of the chromophores released from lysate-incubated Apo-YLOV two individual flavin species with retention times (t<sub>R</sub>) of 8.88 min and 8.04&#x000b1;0.05 min were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081268-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Based on calibrations with RF (t<sub>R</sub> = 8.88 min), FMN (t<sub>R</sub> = 8.17&#x000b1;0.01 min) and FAD (t<sub>R</sub> = 7.58&#x000b1;0.01 min), one signal clearly corresponds to RF, whereas the retention time of the second peak points to FMN but slightly shifted towards FAD. The UV-Vis spectrum recorded at the peak maximum, however, uniquely corresponds to that from the FMN reference suggesting that it is indeed FMN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081268-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). This is particularly evident in the spectral range below 220 nm where only FAD exhibits an additional absorption maximum at 212 nm caused by the adenosine moiety [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><fig id="pone-0081268-g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0081268.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>HPLC-based analysis of flavins isolated from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cell lysate.</title><p>(A) By means of reverse-phase HPLC, flavins isolated from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cell lysate using His-tagged Apo-YLOV as a molecular probe were identified as RF and FMN.

The method does not allow any conclusion about the absolute cytosolic flavin concentration but taking the binding constants into account FMN and RF appear to be present in equimolar concentrations. This result together with the fact that the cells did not contain sufficiently free FAD is somewhat surprising because RF is usually quickly converted into FMN and FAD [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. An explanation could be the physiological constitution of the stationary-phase cells suffering from either an impaired FAD biosynthesis or a generally lower flavin content. Although Apo-YLOV binds FAD with three times the affinity of FMN, the protein likewise contained virtually no FAD upon heterologous expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> suggesting that the FAD pool is rapidly depleted at the beginning of the expression phase while all initially present and continuously synthesized FMN and also a little RF is captured by continuously increasing amounts of apoprotein. This effect could be directly associated with the expression rate and would explain the varying flavin compositions found in heterologously expressed LOV proteins.</p><p>Moreover, the protein has potential to be used as a flavin specific molecular probe for the determination of flavin ratios in soluble fractions from cell lysates. This would, however, require a further validation of the method, testing whether the affinity-tagged protein can reliably reproduce the flavin composition of standard mixtures and is not influenced by the composition of the flavin pool.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have established a robust protocol for the efficient preparation of the apo form of the bacterial phototropin-like photoreceptor YtvA and its isolated LOV domain that allows complete conversion of holoproteins into soluble apoproteins. Both Apo-YtvA and Apo-YLOV can be fully reconstituted with RF, FMN and FAD under physiological conditions and we show here that all reconstituted variants are photochemically active and adopt the same structure as the respective holoproteins prepared under non-denaturating conditions. The results clearly show that the chromophore stabilizes the holoprotein since its absence alters the structure and the conformational dynamics of the whole LOV domain leading to a significant weakening but not to a loss of the LOV-LOV interaction. Beyond that the results confirmed our assumption [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] about the presence of intra-molecular interactions between the STAS domains resulting in a dimerization of YtvA.</p><p>By means of ITC experiments, we have studied the thermodynamics of the interaction of Apo-YLOV with RF, FMN and FAD and found that the YtvA-LOV domain binds all tested flavins with comparable affinities in the upper nanomolar range which means that this domain does not prefer FMN and that the terminal phosphate of FMN might not be necessary for binding. Comparison of <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-TROSY spectra of the reconstituted proteins indicated that variants containing RF or FMN adopt virtually the same global structure with only very small differences in chromophore surrounding regions. Absence of the phosphate group most likely changes the hydrogen bonding network within the binding pocket which explains the accelerated dark-state recovery of RF-YtvA and RF-YLOV. In contrast, YLOV associated with FAD has an enhanced conformational flexibility most likely caused by transient interactions of the adenine moiety with residues on the protein surface.</p><p>All tested flavins exert a stabilizing effect on the conformation of the LOV domain. On the basis of sedimentation velocity experiments performed with Apo-YtvA and Apo-YLOV, we demonstrate that the loss of the chromophore reduces the binding constant for LOV-LOV self-dimerization by at least two orders of magnitude and we confirm our previous assumption that dimerization of YtvA is indeed forced not only by intermolecular LOV-LOV contacts but also by interactions between the STAS domains.</p><p>Finally we demonstrate the application of Apo-YLOV as a molecular probe for free flavins in cell lysate from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and found that endogenous YtvA is associated with 71% RF and 29% FMN.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Buffer</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>30 mM Tris-HCl pH = 7.9; 300 mM NaCl; 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>; 5 mM imidazole; 10% glycerol; Complete protease inhibitor mix (Roche)</p></list-item><list-item><p>20 mM Na-Phosphate pH = 7.4; 50 mM NaCl; 1 mM DTT</p></list-item><list-item><p>20 mM Tris-HCl pH = 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 8 M urea</p></list-item><list-item><p>20 mM Tris-HCl pH = 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 6.5 M urea</p></list-item><list-item><p>20 mM Tris-HCl pH = 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 1mM DTT</p></list-item><list-item><p>20 mM Tris-HCl pH = 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 400 mM imidazole</p></list-item><list-item><p>20 mM Tris-HCl pH = 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 500&#x000b5;M TCEP</p></list-item><list-item><p>20 mM K-Phosphate pH = 6.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT; 0.1% azide</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s4.2"><title>Cloning</title><p>Construction of the expression plasmids for full length YtvA (aa 1 &#x02013; 261) and for the LOV domain of YtvA (YLOV, aa 1 &#x02013; 128) was performed as described earlier [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

Photo conversion and accumulation of the photoactivated state were achieved by illuminating the samples contained in a 200 &#x000b5;l pipette tip for 30 s with a high power LED (H6-RGB-9; &#x003bb;<sub>max</sub> = 460 nm; &#x003a6; = 430 mW; Roithner Lasertechnik; Austria). The spectra were measured using a DU-520 spectrophotometer (Beckman-Coulter).</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0081268.s005.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0081268.s006"><label>Figure S6</label><caption><p>
<bold>Superimposed <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectra of dark-state and illuminated YLOV.</bold>
The <sup>1</sup>H-spectra of dark-state (black) and illuminated YLOV (red) differ significantly indicating light-induced structural rearrangements. The signals enlarged in the insets were used to monitor the dark-state recovery kinetics by tracking its intensity changes during conversion of photo activated YLOV to the ground state. The intensity of the signal at -0.475 ppm (B) is maximum in the ground state going to zero after illumination whereas the signal at 6.46 ppm (A) displays opposing characteristics. Corresponding signals are also present in <sup>1</sup>H-spectra of YtvA and YLOV variants containing RF or FAD. The signal at -0.475 ppm belongs to a methyl group of I108. The origin of the other signal (B) is unknown. To obtain the lit-state spectrum, sample was illuminated using our previously described fiber coupled light source [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Spectra were acquired at 27&#x000b0;C on a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker Avance III) equipped with a 5 mm triple resonance PFG (z-axis) cryo probe head.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0081268.s006.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0081268.s007"><label>Figure S7</label><caption><p>
