However, current eukaryotic light-gated transcription systems are limited by toxicity, dynamic range, or slow activation/deactivation. Here we present an optogenetic gene expression system that addresses these shortcomings and demonstrate its broad utility. Our approach utilizes an engineered version of EL222, a bacterial Light-Oxygen-Voltage (LOV) protein that binds DNA when illuminated with blue light. The system has a large (&#x0003e;100-fold) dynamic range of protein expression, rapid activation (&#x0003c; 10 s) and deactivation kinetics (&#x0003c; 50 s), and a highly linear response to light. With this system, we achieve light-gated transcription in several mammalian cell lines and intact zebrafish embryos with minimal basal gene activation and toxicity. Our approach provides a powerful new tool for optogenetic control of gene expression in space and time.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Essential for many applications in biomedical research, inducible promoter systems enable the artificial control of gene transcription in eukaryotic cells<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. While many of these tools are widely useful, their reliance on small molecule inducers (<italic>e.g.</italic> doxycycline) limits their utility when precisely timed or localized induction is desired. Once applied, chemical inducers are also limited by their rate of diffusion (slowing activation), difficult removal (slowing deactivation), and potential off-target effects on normal cellular function. In contrast, light is a rapid and nontoxic stimulus that naturally regulates many different cellular processes in diverse settings<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. To take advantage of these favorable properties, a variety of natural photosensitive proteins have recently been engineered into light-controlled transcriptional activators<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, providing the potential to regulate gene expression with previously unattainable spatiotemporal control. Nevertheless, these systems have significant drawbacks that limit their use in a wide range of experiments. These disadvantages include toxicity<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, low levels of transcriptional activation (&#x0003c; 20-fold)<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, long deactivation times (&#x0003e; 2 hr)<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, use of exotic chromophores not found in vertebrates<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, potential interference of the active photoreceptor with endogenous signaling pathways<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, and the need for multiple protein components<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">To address these limitations, we developed a new inducible promoter system using the EL222 bacterial transcription factor<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, which only contains the minimal elements needed for light-dependent transcriptional activation: a photosensory LOV<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> domain and a Helix-Turn-Helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain. In the dark, the LOV domain binds the HTH domain, covering the HTH 4&#x003b1; helix essential to dimerization and DNA binding<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Blue light illumination (450 nm) triggers the photochemical formation of a protein/flavin adduct within the LOV domain, disrupting inhibitory LOV/HTH interactions and allowing EL222 to dimerize and bind DNA<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. These structural changes spontaneously reverse in the dark, rapidly inactivating EL222 (&#x003c4; ~11 s at 37&#x000b0;C<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>). Within the native <italic>Erythrobacter litoralis</italic> HTCC2594 host, we observed light-dependent activation of genes adjacent to genomic EL222-binding sites, implicating this protein as a photosensitive transcription factor<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Our mechanistic understanding of EL222 paves the way for its use in a single-protein component system for light-dependent gene activation. Here we report that a minimally-engineered variant of EL222 activates transcription in different eukaryotic systems upon stimulation with moderate levels of blue light. With this method, we demonstrate over 200-fold upregulation of gene expression from an EL222-responsive luciferase reporter in 293T cells illuminated with levels of blue light compatible with robust cellular growth. In contrast, dark-state and red light controls show &#x0003c; 2-fold changes, establishing minimal leakiness under non-inducing conditions. Our system has rapid activation (&#x0003c; 10 s) and deactivation kinetics (&#x0003c; 50 s), which compare favorably to the &#x0003e; 2 hr turn-off kinetics of a recently developed LOV-based transcriptional system<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Furthermore, our system can achieve functional regulation of cellular processes, as we demonstrate for light-gated regulation of splicing in T-cells. Finally, we demonstrate that EL222 can be used for either global or tissue-specific light-dependent gene expression in zebrafish with minimal toxicity, expanding the repertoire of this expression system. Taken together, our data highlight the broad utility of the EL222 system and its strengths as an optogenetic tool.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="S1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S2"><title>Development of an inducible promoter system based on EL222</title><p id="P5">EL222, a small (222 residue) bacterial transcription factor, is the basis of our engineered expression system (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Two N-terminal additions adapt this protein for eukaryotic applications: a VP16 transcriptional activation domain (AD)<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and a nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that the resulting VP-EL222 fusion protein was expressed in 293T cells and distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Results</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><p id="P6">To test the potency of the VP-EL222 transactivator system, we constructed a reporter vector containing the firefly luciferase (Fluc) gene under the control of five copies of the EL222-binding Clone 1&#x02013;20 bp (C120)<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> sequence and a TATA box promoter (pC120-Fluc) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). In transient transfections, 293T cells expressing VP-EL222 showed elevated levels of luciferase with pulsed blue light illumination (24 hr of 20 s on, 60 s off cycles; 8 W/m<sup>2</sup> at 465 nm) compared to dark-state control cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). The light-driven upregulation of luciferase levels required EL222, since transfection of a vector containing only the VP16 AD (empty vector) showed effectively no activation of the pC120-Fluc reporter in any condition. Importantly, the luciferase levels observed between cells expressing VP16 AD alone and the dark-state VP-EL222 cells are similar, establishing that VP-EL222 protein has minimal dark-state activity (as seen with <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA binding assays<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>) and attributing background levels to basal activation of the reporter construct itself.</p><p id="P7">To quantify the transcriptional fold change (FC) of pC120-Fluc, we normalized the firefly luciferase values to an internal vector control (co-transfected with pVP-EL222 and pC120-Fluc) which used the constitutive CMV promoter to drive expression of <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (Rluc). We calculated that cells transfected with VP-EL222 showed 216-fold upregulation of luciferase relative to cells transfected with empty vector when illuminated with blue light (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). In contrast, cells kept in the dark showed only a two-fold change, as expected from the low affinity of EL222 for DNA in the dark<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Taken together, these results demonstrate a net 108-fold increase in luciferase expression arising directly from illumination.</p><p id="P8">For maximum utility, specificity in inducible promoter systems is essential &#x02013; both with target DNA sequences and with input stimuli &#x02013; to avoid off-target effects. For the former, we previously investigated the <italic>in vitro</italic> specificity of EL222 with variants of the C120 DNA, showing that single basepair changes reduce EL222/DNA affinity over ten-fold<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Here we show that VP-EL222 retains its selectivity for C120 DNA in 293T cells, as measured by the increased expression from the pC120-Fluc reporter compared to two control constructs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). The first control contains three copies of a lower affinity EL222 substrate called AN45<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> (p(AN45)<sub>3</sub>-Fluc), which binds EL222 approximately 30-fold more weakly than C120<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. A second control contained five copies of the GAL4-binding Upstream Activation Sequence (UAS) (p(UAS)<sub>5</sub>-Fluc). In both cases, luciferase levels were low and invariant to illumination when co-transfected with pVP-EL222. Critically, expression levels from the two control vectors are comparable to those from pC120-Fluc when VP-EL222 is present and kept in the dark. This demonstrates that the measured leakiness in our experiments arises from basal transcription from the minimal promoter and not spurious dark activation of VP-EL222 or by binding of any cellular factors to the C120 promoter. Lastly, we underscore that the minimal promoter and UAS sequences used here were obtained from commercial sources that have previously evaluated their background activity<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, establishing our VP-EL222/C120 as having comparable background as these widely-used reagents.</p><p id="P9">Additional experiments confirmed that expression of pVP-EL222 in 293T cells did not significantly affect cell viability as compared to the pVP-empty control under both dark and light conditions (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>), suggesting that neither VP-EL222 itself, VP-EL222 driven transcription, nor our illumination protocol generate any gross toxicity. Lastly, we found that VP-EL222 is not triggered by continuous red light, as luciferase levels from the pC120-Fluc reporter are comparable under dark and red light conditions (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2b,c</xref>). This indicates that VP-EL222 is specifically activated by blue light, consistent with standard LOV photochemistry. Together these data demonstrate that the functional and photochemical properties inherent to EL222 are suitable for use in heterologous expression in mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Characterization of VP-EL222 in stably transfected cells</title><p id="P10">To reduce experimental variability caused by differential transfection efficiencies, we stably expressed VP-EL222 in 293T cells and transfected only the pC120-FLuc plasmid (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). As a control, wild-type 293T cells (without VP-EL222) were also transfected with pC120-Fluc alone. Consistent with our pVP-EL222 transient transfection data, luciferase levels were greatly enhanced in stable VP-EL222 cells illuminated with blue light relative to cells left in the dark (162-fold dark-to-light enhancement after 12 hr illumination with 20 s on, 60 s off cycle). Furthermore, we again observed that luciferase levels in VP-EL222-expressing cells kept in the dark were comparable to those measured from wild-type 293T cells in both conditions. These results establish that the VP-EL222 system can generate high reporter gene expression in both transient and stable transfection experiments and that dark-state leakiness stems from basal activation of the pC120-Fluc vector itself.</p><p id="P11">A key advantage of a light-switchable promoter system is the ease of tuning gene expression levels by modifying illumination protocols. We investigated the effects of modifying one such parameter &#x02013; the duration of the on/off duty cycle &#x02013; by examining luciferase expression off the pC120-Fluc reporter in the VP-EL222 stable cell line (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Within a constant 80 s period, we observed an expected dose-dependent increase in luciferase with increasing duration of illumination during each cycle, with a linear correlation between luciferase levels and illumination times for periods of 5 s or greater. In addition to producing luciferase at levels easily quantitated by enzymatic output, VP-EL222 is capable of expressing proteins at levels sufficient to be detected by Western blot (luciferase, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>) or fluorescence microscopy (mCherry, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). In both cases, signals were detectable only in the presence of VP-EL222 and following blue light illumination.</p><p id="P12">Turning from steady-state measurements to the kinetics of gene expression, we examined protein and mRNA levels as a function of illumination time. To do so, we measured the luciferase activities of VP-EL222-expressing cells transfected with pC120-Fluc and incubated in the dark or illuminated with a 20 s on, 60 s off protocol for the indicated times (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). As a control, luciferase levels were also measured in wild-type 293T cells transfected with pC120-Fluc and illuminated with blue light pulses. We observed that luciferase activity was rapidly induced, with 80-fold increases observed over VP-EL222 dark-state control after only 3 hr. Induction levels further increased slightly to around 90-fold by 6 hr, and plateaued after 9 hr at 100-fold. Interestingly, luciferase activity began to drop slightly between 12&#x02013;24 hr; nevertheless, after 24 hr luciferase expression remained &#x0003e; 20-fold above background. While we detected a time-dependent increase in luciferase activity in dark VP-EL222 cells, this was virtually identical to 293T control values and significantly lower than from comparable illuminated VP-EL222 cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, p &#x0003c; 0.0001).</p><p id="P13">In parallel, we measured luciferase mRNA levels using qPCR (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>), quantitating the relative expression level in each sample with a normalized cycle threshold value (&#x00394;C<sub>T</sub>) (&#x00394;C<sub>T</sub> = C<sub>T</sub> Fluc - C<sub>T</sub> GAPDH). As expected, the &#x00394;C<sub>T</sub> values for light-treated VP-EL222 sample were smaller than those measured for dark VP-EL222 and light-treated 293T samples. These &#x00394;C<sub>T</sub> values were used to calculate luciferase mRNA fold changes in VP-EL222 dark and light-treated samples relative to the light-treated 293T control. These analyses showed that luciferase mRNA spiked after 3 hr of illumination, maximizing after at 6 hr (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref> inset; ~ 16-fold increase over 293T control). After 9 hr of illumination, luciferase mRNA levels decreased to 9-fold over 293T control, before falling to &#x0003c; 2-fold up at 24 hr. We note that these trends in luciferase transcript levels precede the corresponding trend in protein levels (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). These data suggest a loss of VP-EL222 transcriptional activity during extended illumination, potentially due to a moderate decrease in VP-EL222 protein levels (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p id="P14">This time-dependent decrease led us to ask if VP-EL222 could be reactivated after an initial round of illumination followed by a dark recovery period to allow for synthesis of fresh transcription factor. To do so, we monitored luciferase activity in wild-type 293T and stable VP-EL222 cells (both transfected with pC120-Fluc) that were initially illuminated with blue light (20 s on, 60 s off) for 3 hr, incubated in the dark for 21 hr, then again illuminated for 3 hr (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). After the initial activation, luciferase levels elevated approximately 75-fold over dark control VP-EL222 cells. Once the light was removed, the absolute amount of luciferase activity remained elevated in the illuminated cells; however, luciferase background levels slowly increased in the dark control VP-EL222 cells, dropping the dark-to-light fold induction to near background levels over 21 hr (&#x0003c; 1.5-fold difference dark-to-light). After this recovery period, cells were illuminated for 3 hr with pulsing blue light, increasing luciferase levels back up to 11-fold over VP-EL222 dark-state controls. Following another 21 hr dark recovery period, luciferase induction decreased to around 3.7-fold. Critically, similar luciferase levels were seen in dark control VP-EL222 cells and illuminated wild-type 293T cells throughout, as observed previously. Therefore, the data show that light-triggered activation of VP-EL222 can generate multiple rounds of gene expression, enabling novel experiments utilizing transient increases of protein level.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Modeling transcriptional kinetics of VP-EL222 in cells</title><p id="P15">Aspects of these applications &#x02013; linear dose-response (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) and favorable kinetic properties (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>) &#x02013; are enabled by the intrinsically fast activation and deactivation kinetics of EL222. <italic>In vitro</italic> measurements reveal LOV domains activate <italic>via</italic> microsecond-to-millisecond timescale events<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, while deactivation by adduct cleavage occurs over seconds to hours<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Comparable activation/deactivation measurements for VP-EL222 driven transcription within cells are complicated by slow reporter mRNA and protein turnover (<italic>e.g.</italic> luciferase mRNA half-life: 3&#x02013;5 hr<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, protein: 3&#x02013;4 hr<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>), limiting the temporal resolution of many experiments that yield this information. As an alternative, we developed a kinetic model that correlates gene expression with the times required for VP-EL222 to initiate transcription upon illumination (&#x003c4;<sub>on</sub>) or cease in the dark (&#x003c4;<sub>off</sub>) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Notes 1, 2</xref>). This model lets us obtain information on second-timescale events from final end-point measurements of luciferase levels accumulated from repeatedly activating VP-EL222, each time gaining a burst of mRNA (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Coupled with an accompanying least-squared error analysis (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), this framework lets us determine how consistent different combinations of &#x003c4;<sub>on</sub> and &#x003c4;<sub>off</sub> values are with our experimental measurements. For activation, the observed lag in luciferase expression at short illumination times implies an initial &#x003c4;<sub>on</sub> delay of approximately several seconds for VP-EL222 to activate, bind DNA and initiate transcription. Our model exhibits an expected inverse relationship between gene expression and &#x003c4;<sub>on</sub>, with values near 5 s recapitulating our data most accurately (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). On deactivation, our model recapitulates a direct link between &#x003c4;<sub>off</sub> and luciferase levels, with optimal &#x003c4;<sub>off</sub> values of approximately 30 s (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). A more complete grid search of all values of &#x003c4;<sub>on</sub> and &#x003c4;<sub>off</sub> reveals a range of values compatible with our data (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). This range includes activation times of approximately 3&#x02013;5 s, compatible with single molecule measurements of transcriptional initiation rates<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and the high level of VP-EL222 within 293T cells. The same analysis indicates &#x003c4;<sub>off</sub> values between 10&#x02013;40 s; the shortest of these delays is consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> measurements of EL222 adduct cleavage (&#x003c4;<sub>adduct</sub> ~ 11 s at 37&#x000b0;C<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>), suggesting that cellular factors have limited effects on this critical step.

Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced activation of JSL1 cells increases CELF2 expression, promoting its binding to regulatory sequences in target pre-mRNAs and affecting their processing<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Indeed, at high levels CELF2 protein represses the inclusion of exon 6 in its own pre-mRNA<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, providing an assay to ascertain if the VP-EL222 system could drive CELF2 overexpression sufficiently to confer light-dependent control of pre-mRNA splicing.</p><p id="P18">To examine this, we created a JSL1 cell line stably integrated with both the pVP-EL222 activator and a FLAG-tagged CELF2 under the control of the EL222-specific C120 promoter (VP-EL222/CELF2 cells). VP-EL222/CELF2 cells incubated in the dark showed nearly no expression of FLAG-CELF2 protein by immunoblot analysis (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>), while cells exposed to blue light for 24 hr (20 s on, 60 s off) showed moderate FLAG-CELF2 expression indicating functional light-triggered activation of VP-EL222 in JSL1 cells. Notably, the levels of VP-EL222 protein itself decreased markedly (&#x0003e; 50%) with light exposure (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>), more substantially than we observed with 293T cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Nevertheless, the small amount of VP-EL222 is sufficient to produce amounts of CELF2 protein readily detectable by Western blot.</p><p id="P19">To address the functional significance of light-induced FLAG-CELF2 upregulation, we analyzed the splicing pattern of exon 6 of the endogenous CELF2 transcript by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis using primers that specifically recognize the endogenous transcript and not the transfected cDNA. We found that blue light induced a moderate, but statistically significant, increase in the skipping of the CELF2 exon 6 in VP-EL222/CELF2 cells (p &#x0003c; 0.05, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>), demonstrating light-regulated alternative splicing. Importantly, blue light treatment had no discernible effects on exon 6 inclusion in wild-type JSL1 cells, underscoring the necessity of the photosensitive VP-EL222 in this process. Previous studies determined that PMA stimulation of JSL1 cells leads to a two-fold increase in CELF2 protein levels<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, changing percent exon inclusion values by 20&#x02013;30%<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. In our experiment, light increases the amount of FLAG-CELF2 protein five-fold over dark control; however, this does not detectably increase total CELF2 levels as seen by Western blot. This observation is consistent with known autoregulatory mechanisms which maintain stable CELF2 expression<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. In addition, the fact that induction of FLAG-CELF2 only marginally increases overall CELF2 protein is consistent with the relative effect we observed in CELF2 exon 6 skipping (20% to 25%).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>VP-EL222 serves as a transcriptional activator <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P20">Transitioning from cell culture to intact multicellular organisms, we examined the capability of VP-EL222 to drive light-triggered gene expression in the zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>). To do so, we microinjected the pC120-mCherry plasmid into zebrafish embryos at the one-cell stage, with or without 50 pg VP-EL222 mRNA (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). When embryos microinjected with VP-EL222 mRNA and pC120-mCherry were illuminated with constant blue light (14 mW/m<sup>2</sup>), mCherry fluorescence was readily detected after only 5 hr (70% epiboly stage). After 22 hr illumination (24 hr post-fertilization [h.p.f.] stage), 100% of the 50 embryos analyzed had marked mCherry fluorescence, the level of which is nicely illustrated by a z-stack series of an embryo at 70% epiboly with VP-EL222 driven mCherry expression (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). In contrast, when VP-EL222/pC120-mCherry embryos were left in the dark or did not receive VP-EL222 mRNA, no fluorescence was detected (0/50 embryos in each set; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Video 2</xref>). These results show that VP-EL222 can rapidly and robustly activate transcription in developing zebrafish in a light-dependent manner.</p><p id="P21">Complementing these embryo-wide expression studies, we examined the ability to use VP-EL222 for light-inducible, tissue-specific gene expression. For this, we constructed a dual-promoter plasmid encoding the VP-EL222 ORF controlled by the zebrafish cardiac <italic>myl7</italic> (myosin light polypeptide 7) promoter<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> and the mCherry ORF controlled by the EL222-specific C120 promoter. Zebrafish embryos microinjected with p<italic>myl7</italic>-VP-EL222/C120-mCherry plasmid and illuminated with constant blue light, but not dark counterparts, showed noticeable mCherry fluorescence that was specifically localized in the developing heart (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Video 3</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Finally, we examined the toxicity of VP-EL222 in zebrafish embryos, comparing groups that were illuminated after being titrated with different amounts of VP-EL222 or GFP mRNA (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). We found that a small amount of VP-EL222 (50 pg mRNA) was sufficient to elicit high levels of mCherry expression (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>) with only minimal morphological effects (81% unaffected embryos for VP-EL222 vs. 93% for GFP) or toxicity (&#x0003c;10% severely affected or dead) when compared with comparable GFP controls. Increasing amounts of microinjected VP-EL222 mRNA up to 150 pg affected more embryos, but these effects (~60% embryos unaffected; [severely affected + dead] &#x0003c; 25%) remained constant above this level. These results suggest that VP-EL222 protein is only moderately toxic to zebrafish, much less than observed for a cryptochrome-based light-driven transcription system<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S7"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P23">Here we describe a new inducible gene expression system that confers high-level, blue light-sensitive control of transcriptional initiation to human cell lines and zebrafish embryos. Using the naturally-occurring EL222 transcription factor<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, we take advantage of LOV domain photochemistry and subsequent conformational changes, as seen in other LOV domains and the related Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) sensors<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P24">More broadly, this system has several benefits compared with alternative photocontrolled gene expression methods. First, VP-EL222 functions in a range of eukaryotic cell settings, enabled by the use of widely-available flavin chromophores and thus eliminating the need to supply exogenous cofactors or precursors<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Additionally, VP-EL222 has low toxicity (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>) and basal transcriptional activity in cell lines and zebrafish (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>); both features may be related to the absence of intact C120 targets in the human and zebrafish genomes (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Second, the required VP-EL222 photochemistry is triggered with low intensity blue light (8 W/m<sup>2</sup> = 0.008 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>), less than required to activate channelrhodopsin-driven optogenetic applications (<italic>e.g.</italic> 5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>)<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Third, VP-EL222 uses only a single 33 kDa protein with a directly-regulated DNA binding step, simplifying genetic manipulation and tuning compared to light-dependent two-hybrid systems<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> or those which must tie into existing cellular signaling pathways<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Finally, VP-EL222 quickly activates and resets after illumination (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>), facilitating transient-expression experiments and predictable dose-response behavior.</p><p id="P25">A final characteristic of VP-EL222 that warrants explicit discussion is the background expression under non-inducing conditions. This can arise from two sources: 1) residual dark state binding of EL222 to C120 sites and 2) spurious activation of the minimal promoter from the reporter vector itself. We consistently observed that pC120-Fluc alone produced similar activation levels as dark-state VP-EL222-expressing cells transfected with pC120-Fluc (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), strongly suggesting that any basal activation comes primarily from pC120-Fluc itself. Importantly, these background expression levels are equivalent to those from a commercial GAL4-driven expression vector (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) containing widely-used consensus UAS sites<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. From a practical standpoint, it is also clear that any background expression we observed with VP-EL222 had minimal effects among many different types of experiments (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). We appreciate that some other applications may be affected by this low background activation (<italic>e.g.</italic> overexpression of certain enzymes); therefore, we present raw activity / abundance values in formats that most clearly demonstrate background expression levels (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) to inform users of these methods of potential contributions that may arise from this source. Finally, we also note that promoter modifications may establish lower background expression levels, as demonstrated in the optimization of Tet-responsive systems<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P26">Recently, a variety of light-inducible systems for regulating gene expression in mammalian cells<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> have been reported. Such systems fall roughly in two categories, based on their regulation of a). DNA binding or b). recruitment of a TAD to a DNA-bound protein. The first group is typified by a highly-modified version of the Vivid LOV protein, which can strongly activate gene transcription (&#x0003e; 200-fold)<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> albeit with somewhat non-ideal dose-response behavior and deactivation kinetics due to a long-lived photoadduct (half-life = 2 hr). The second strategy is more widely used, with a flexible two-hybrid type implementation involving TALE DNA-binding domains with a light-inducible CRY2/CIB interaction to reversibly recruit a TAD<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. While this system can be customized to target many DNA sites, it also uses TALE domains constitutively bound to DNAs, potentially altering endogenous protein/DNA interactions nearby. In contrast, the direct photocontrol of VP-EL222 DNA binding minimizes such in the dark. While VP-EL222 is currently restricted to one binding site, prior HTH engineering studies<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> suggest that this could be changed in VP-EL222 variants.</p><p id="P27">Looking ahead, we see many cell biology, synthetic biology and other applications of artificial transcriptional regulators with different needs, such as maximum kinetic resolution or sensitivity. Mechanism-based approaches &#x02013; such as EL222 variants engineered with shorter- and longer-lived photoactive states<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> &#x02013; will be essential to developing reagents optimized for each of these applications. Such engineering is facilitated by correlations between <italic>in vitro</italic> and cellular properties (<italic>e.g.</italic> deactivation times), enabling rapid and simple screening of mutants. Coupled with the ability to control epigenetic or other cellular machinery to specific DNA sites in a light-dependent manner with other VP-EL222 variants, we anticipate that this protein will enable an even wider range of applications in the future.</p></sec><sec id="S8" specific-use="web-only"><title>ONLINE METHODS</title><sec id="S9"><title>Vector construction</title><p id="P28">DNA containing residues 14&#x02013;222 of EL222<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> was cloned into the pVP16 (Clontech) vector to obtain pVP-EL222.
