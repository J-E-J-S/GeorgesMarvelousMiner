However, current Sf9/Cap-Rep packaging cell line-dependent OneBac systems still lack versatility and flexibility for large-scale production of rAAVs. In this study, we developed an improved OneBac system that includes a novel dual-function baculovirus expression vector (BEV) termed BEV/Cap-(ITR-GOI) that carries both the AAV <italic>Cap</italic> gene and rAAV genome inverted terminal repeat (ITR) sequences flanking the gene of interest (GOI), a versatile Sf9-GFP/Rep packaging cell line that harbors silent copies of the AAV2 <italic>Rep</italic> gene that can be expressed after BEV infection, and constitutively expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter genes to facilitate cell line screening. The BEV/Cap-(ITR-GOI) construct allows flexibility to switch among different <italic>Cap</italic> gene serotypes using simple BEV reconstruction, and is stable for at least five serial passages. Furthermore, the Sf9-GFP/Rep stable cell line is versatile for production of different rAAV serotypes. The yield levels for rAAV2, rAAV8, and rAAV9 exceeded 10<sup>5</sup> vector genomes (VG) per cell, which is similar to other currently available large-scale rAAV production systems. The new Bac system-derived rAAVs have biophysical properties similar to HEK293 cell-derived rAAVs, as well as high quality and activity. In summary, the novel Sf9-GFP/Rep packaging cell line-dependent OneBac system can facilitate large-scale rAAV production and rAAV-based gene therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>rAAV production</kwd><kwd>OneBac</kwd><kwd>recombinant baculovirus</kwd><kwd>Sf9 packaging cell line</kwd><kwd>gene therapy</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><ref-count count="36"/><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) have a unique genome that contains a gene of interest (GOI) flanked by the inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) of the AAV that can be packaged in viral capsids.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> rAAVs have many advantages including the ability to efficiently infect different cell types, diverse serotypes related to cell-type tropism, long and persistent expression periods, and low pathogenic risk, which together make rAAV a promising viral vector for gene therapy.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The traditional method to produce rAAVs involves HEK293 cell-based triple-plasmid cotransfection.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The three plasmids contain the ITR-GOI, <italic>Rep</italic> gene, <italic>Cap</italic> gene, and adenovirus helper genes. The AAV ITRs provide <italic>cis</italic> elements required for rAAV replication and packaging, whereas the AAV <italic>Rep</italic> gene, <italic>Cap</italic> gene, and helper virus genes are supplied in <italic>trans</italic>. After the approval of the rAAV-based gene therapy drugs Glybera to treat lipoprotein lipase deficiency, Luxturna to treat hereditary retinal dystrophy, and Zolgensma to treat lethal spinal muscular atrophy, in 2012, 2017, and 2019, respectively, the need for large amounts of rAAVs having different serotypes for use in clinical applications has been increasing.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref></sup></p><p>However, traditional methods are not suitable for large-scale production of rAAV<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and thus alternative baculovirus expression vector (BEV)-mediated rAAV production systems (Bac systems) have recently been developed. Highly efficient BEV infection provides advantages over traditional plasmid transfection.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Moreover, insect Sf9 cells are better suited for large-scale and high-density serum-free suspension culture than HEK293 cells.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>The previous two decades have seen significant advances in large-scale rAAV production methods based on Bac systems. In 2002, Urabe <italic>et al.</italic> reported the first successful generation of rAAV upon coinfection of insect cells with three BEVs: BEV/Cap, BEV/Rep, and BEV/(ITR-GOI).<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> However, this approach is not widely used due to low yields and genetic instability, particularly for BEV/Rep.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> To improve the genetic stability of the BEVs, the Rep and Cap expression cassettes were optimized. In 2008, Chen constructed a modified BEV/Cap-Rep to express AAV Rep and Cap proteins using artificial introns.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In 2009, Smith <italic>et al.</italic> modified the AAV Rep and Cap expression cassettes using leaky ribosome scanning to construct another kind of BEV/Cap-Rep. The Rep or Cap proteins can both be translated from single mRNA transcripts.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> These dual-functional BEV/Cap-Rep constructs were stable and showed no apparent decrease in Cap and Rep protein expression after five or seven continuous passages.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> These two-Bac systems have gradually replaced the previously used three-Bac system. However, low coinfection ratios of multi-BEVs often result in defective rAAV and low yields.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>In 2009, Aslanidi <italic>et al.</italic> established an Sf9/Cap-Rep packaging cell line integrated with silent copies of both AAV Rep and <italic>Cap</italic> genes, which enable rAAV production by single BEV/(ITR-GOI) infection. The rAAV yield with this cell line exceeded 10<sup>5</sup> vector genomes (VG) per cell, which is &#x0223c;10 times higher than previous multi BEV-based Bac systems.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In 2014, Mietzsch <italic>et al.</italic> further expanded this Sf9/Cap-Rep packaging cell line-dependent OneBac system to produce the full range of rAAV1-12 serotypes.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In 2018, Wu <italic>et al.</italic> created a single BEV/Cap-(ITR-GOI)-Rep that integrated all of the elements for rAAV production in both cultured Sf9 cells and armyworm larvae.<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The rAAV yield level in this system was similar to the current highest state upon infection of Sf9 cells. Moreover, this research was the first to exploit a potential low-cost rAAV production method in insect larvae. However, the main concern with this system is that BEV stability could decrease significantly after four serial passages.</p><p>For the Sf9 packaging cell line-dependent OneBac system, recent progress mainly involved modifications to the AAV Rep and Cap expression cassettes used to construct Sf9/Cap-Rep packaging cell lines. In 2015 and 2017, Mietzsch <italic>et al.</italic> developed an improved OneBac 2.0 system<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> that had 100-fold enhancement in rAAV5 infectivity through the use of a splicing-based strategy to raise the relative amounts of VP1 in AAV5 capsids. Meanwhile, collateral packaging of nonvector DNA was significantly suppressed in the absence of Rep-binding element (RBE) during the production of AAV1, AAV2, AAV5, and AAV8. In 2019, Joshi <italic>et al.</italic> developed a scalable and robust AAV5 production process through fed-batch bioreactor using the OneBac 2.0 system.<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> However, the Sf9/Cap-Rep packaging cell line lacked versatility and flexibility for production of rAAVs having different serotypes. These disadvantages severely impeded the application of this Bac system.</p><p>In this study, we developed an improved Sf9 packaging cell line-dependent Bac system by optimizing the distribution of three rAAV packaging elements (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the <italic>Rep</italic> gene, <italic>Cap</italic> gene, and ITR-GOI) between the BEV and Sf9 cell genomes. First, we constructed a novel dual-functional BEV/Cap-(ITR-GOI) that carries the <italic>Cap</italic> gene and the ITR-GOI. This construct provides flexibility to switch among different <italic>Cap</italic> gene serotypes using a simple BEV construct. Second, we constructed a modified Sf9-GFP/Rep packaging cell line that is more versatile and allows simple screening for green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene expression using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The novel Sf9-GFP/Rep packaging cell line-dependent OneBac system is versatile and flexible yet maintains high virus yields and thus can facilitate large-scale rAAV production and rAAV-based gene therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s003"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>The plasmids pAAV-MCS, pAAV-RC2, pAAV-RC8, pAAV-RC9, pAAV-GFP, pAAV-helper (Clontech), and pFast.Bac.dual as well as <italic>Escherichia coli.</italic> DH10Bac (Invitrogen) were maintained in our laboratory.

The major difference between the two types is the regulation mechanisms for Rep and Cap helper gene expression. Compared with the packaging cell line-independent Bac system, the current Sf9/Cap-Rep packaging cell line-dependent Bac system lacks versatility and flexibility. Moreover, for production of different rAAV serotypes, different cell lines that integrate both Rep and <italic>Cap</italic> genes are needed and screening of the packaging cell lines that allow efficient production of rAAV is challenging.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>To overcome the disadvantages of current Sf9/Cap-Rep packaging cell line-dependent Bac systems, we optimized transfer of the <italic>Cap</italic> gene from the Sf9 cells to the BEV. Here we successfully constructed a novel dual-functional BEV/Cap-(ITR-GFP) that carries both the <italic>Cap</italic> gene and the ITR-GOI, and verified its capacity to yield rAAV upon coinfection of Sf9 cells with BEV/Rep. The stability of the BEV is critical for large-scale production of rAAV. We demonstrated that Cap protein expression from BEV/Cap2-(ITR-GFP) was stable for at least five passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>), which is similar to that previously reported for BEV/Cap-Rep that showed stable expression of Rep and Cap proteins over five or seven continuous passages, respectively.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Furthermore, the rAAV yield from BEV/Cap2-(ITR-GFP) was stable and exhibited no apparent decrease for at least five passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Compared with the previously reported BEV/Cap2-(ITR-GFP)-Rep, which was stable for only four passages,<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> the BEV/Cap2-(ITR-GFP) has a better performance in terms of stability. The improved BEV stability might be due to the separation of ITR-GOI and Rep in that the ITR sequences are susceptible to Rep-mediated cleavage.<sup><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Taken together, the higher stability of BEV/Cap-(ITR-GFP) will likely be beneficial for larger scale production of rAAV upon infection of Sf9-GFP/Rep packaging cells.</p><p>For the Sf9-GFP/Rep packaging cell line, the constitutively expressed GFP reporter gene allows the use of FACS that markedly reduces the difficulty of packaging cell line screening.

The sorted cells were then expanded to establish the Sf9-GFP/Rep stable packaging cell line. Compared with the those of unsorted cells, expression levels of both GFP and infection-induced Rep expression showed apparent increases in the sorted Sf9-GFP/Rep cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D, E</xref>).

Thus, optimization of FACS parameters for Sf9-GFP/Rep cells could likely be used to further improve rAAV yield. The rAAV yield from Sf9-GFP/Rep stable cell lines was stable even in the absence of BSD for at least 10 passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). This result is consistent with findings for previously reported Sf9/Cap-Rep packaging cell lines that are genetically stable even in the absence of BSD, and can be cultured and passaged similarly to naive Sf9 cells.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Furthermore, this finding suggests that sorted Sf9-GFP/Rep stable cell lines are suitable for successive scale-up.</p><p>Notably, the high-yield Sf9/Cap-Rep stable cell lines (F3 clone, B8 clone) often had a three- to nine-fold increase in the number of <italic>Cap</italic> gene copies relative to that for the <italic>Rep</italic> gene, as was previously reported.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> These data may indicate that the demand for <italic>Cap</italic> gene expression in Sf9 cells is higher during rAAV production. The different demands for Rep and <italic>Cap</italic> genes expression could introduce some complexity into screening of the high-yield Sf9/Cap-Rep cell line. Even if two different fluorescent reporter genes are used to monitor Cap and Rep expression levels, sorting high-yield Sf9/Cap-Rep packaging cell lines using FACS with undefined parameters for two genes can be difficult. However, moderate levels of Rep expression in Sf9 packaging cells could be sufficient for rAAV production. We, therefore, posit that relocating the <italic>Cap</italic> gene from the Sf9 cell genome to BEV is a better option, since, for the Sf9-GFP/Rep packaging cell line, the GFP reporter gene can easily reflect the <italic>Rep</italic> gene expression. Our results verified that the GFP expression level of the Sf9-GFP/Rep cell line might indeed correlate well with rAAV yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p><p>Modification of infection-inducible constructs for the Sf9/Cap-Rep cell line showed enhanced infectivity with rAAV5 production and minimal encapsidation of foreign DNA for production of rAAV1, rAAV2, rAAV5, and rAAV8 vectors,<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> which demonstrates the unique advantages of Sf9 insect cells for good manufacturing practice-grade vector production relative to that for manufacture using HEK293 cells.<sup><xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> In addition, a recently developed optogenetic gene expression system based on VP-EL222/C120 elements achieved light-gated transcription with spatial and temporal resolution in several mammalian cell lines and intact zebrafish embryos.<sup><xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> We have verified that the VP-EL222/C120 elements can also regulate the expression of fluorescence reporter genes in Sf9 cells (Wu <italic>et al.</italic> unpublished data). The optogenetic gene expression strategy might thus be a potential approach for construction of an Sf9 packaging cell line having inducible <italic>Rep</italic> gene expression. The flexible optogenetic regulation of Rep helper gene expression both spatially and temporally could be helpful for rAAV production. Also, deletion of the baculoviral cathepsin (v-CATH) gene could avoid proteolytic degradation of AAV VP1/VP2 capsid proteins.<sup><xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Further efforts would be helpful for improving the Sf9-GFP/Rep packaging cell line-dependent OneBac system.</p><p>The new OneBac system described here produces rAAV2, rAAV8, and rAAV9 at relatively high yield levels, similar to the current state of large-scale rAAV production systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). The new OneBac system-derived rAAV2, rAAV8, and rAAV9 were of high quality, had similar biophysical properties to those described for rAAV2 produced from 293 cells, and showed high <italic>in vivo</italic> transduction activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). In conclusion, by optimizing the distributions of rAAV packaging elements between the BEV and Sf9 cell genomes, we developed a novel modified Sf9-GFP/Rep packaging cell line and a novel BEV/Cap-(ITR-GOI)-based OneBac system that has improved versatility and flexibility. This study contributes to the new generation of Sf9 packaging cell line-dependent Bac systems for large-scale rAAV production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplemental data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supp_Data.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d38e1099" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to Prof. Sergei Zolotukhin for providing the plasmid pIR-hr2-RBE-rep78, to Liting Luo and Lingling Xu (Core Facility Center, Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics) for technical assistance with centrifugation and microscope imaging, and to Ding Gao and Juan Min (Core Facility Center, Wuhan Institute of Virology) for technical assistance with electron microscopy and FACS.</p></ack><sec id="s018"><title>Authors' Contributions</title><p>Y.W. designed and performed the experiments, analyzed the data, and wrote and edited the article.
