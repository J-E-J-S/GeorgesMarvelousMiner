Within the context of synthetic biology, it is employed to engineer user-defined cellular functions for applications such as metabolic engineering, biosensing, and therapeutics (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The rapid prototyping of engineered functions has been facilitated by advances in <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA assembly, and plasmids have traditionally been used to implement designs <italic>in vivo</italic> given their ease-of-assembly and portability. However, for deployment in contexts beyond the laboratory such as large-scale industrial bioprocesses or among complex microbial communities, plasmid-based circuits suffer from multiple limitations: high intercellular variation in gene expression, genetic instability from random partitioning of plasmids during cell division, and plasmid loss in environments for which antibiotic use could disrupt native microbial communities or is economically infeasible (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). These shortcomings can be ameliorated once a design is transferred from a plasmid to the host genome, which offers improved genetic stability and lower expression variation (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) along with reduced metabolic load (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, behaviors optimized for plasmid contexts often do not map predictably to the genome. As such, building and testing designs directly on the genome can reduce the DBT cycle time and facilitate engineering cellular programs for complex environments.</p><p>Expanding synthetic biology efforts to genome-scale engineering has historically been limited by factors such as low endogenous rates of recombination, lack of optimized workflows for recombination, and uncertainty due to locus-dependent expression variability (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The advent of recombination-based genetic engineering (recombineering), which relies on homologous recombination proteins - often <italic>exo, bet</italic>, and <italic>gam</italic> from bacteriophage &#x003bb; - in conjunction with linear donor DNA containing target homology and the desired mutations, has enabled genomic deletions, insertions, and point mutations at user-defined loci (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;13</xref>). Recombineering has enabled generation of genomic discovery resources such as the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K-12 in-frame, single-gene deletion collection of non-essential genes (Keio collection) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and technologies such as trackable multiplex recombineering (TRMR), which enables genome-scale mapping of genetic modifications to traits of interest (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In addition, pooled library recombineering approaches such as CRISPR-enabled trackable genome engineering (CREATE) have combined CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing schemes with barcode tracking to enable high-throughput mutational profiling at single-nucleotide resolution on a genome-wide scale (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Meanwhile, techniques such as multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) have been developed to generate complex mutagenesis libraries by extending recombineering to simultaneously modify multiple genetic loci through iterative cycles of single-strand DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotide recombination (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). MAGE has enabled several genome-scale recombineering efforts such as the recoding of all 321 occurrences of TAG stop codons with synonymous TAA codons in a single <italic>E. coli</italic> strain (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), the removal of all instances of 13 rare codons from 42 highly expressed essential genes to study genome design constraints (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), the insertion of multiple T7 promoters across 12 genomic operons to optimize metabolite production (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and the His-tagging of 38 essential genes that encode the entire translation machinery over 110 MAGE cycles for subsequent <italic>in vitro</italic> enzyme studies (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In addition, methods such as tracking combinatorial engineered libraries (TRACE) have been developed to facilitate the rapid, high-throughput mapping of multiplex engineered modifications from such genomic explorations to phenotypes of interest (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>To achieve the high levels of recombination necessary to carry out large-scale, multiplexed genome editing, many of these studies required the use of mutagenic strains. Specifically, the endogenous methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system, which acts to revert newly made recombineering modifications when active, was removed to more effectively retain targeted modifications in the standard MAGE strain EcNR2. While deactivation of MMR dramatically enhances recombination efficiency, it also increases the rate of background mutagenesis by 100&#x02013;1000 fold (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Indeed, in converting all 321 occurrences of TAG stop codons to TAA stop codons, Lajoie <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> noted the addition of 355 unintended (i.e. off-target) mutations after the final strain construction (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>Several approaches have been proposed to circumvent the use of MMR-deficient strains and thus avoid their high basal rates of off-target mutagenesis. Designs utilizing mismatches that are poorly repaired or that introduce silent mismatches near the desired mutation can be used to evade MMR, which only recognizes short mismatches (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Furthermore, oligos containing chemically modified bases can be used to evade MMR correction and increase allelic-replacement efficiency (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). While these approaches boost recombination rates without increasing basal mutagenesis rates, they either limit the range of mutations that can be implemented or significantly increase oligonucleotide costs.</p><p>More recent efforts have focused on approaches to create a transient mutagenesis state. Specifically, cells are cycled between phases of elevated mutation rates, during which editing can take place efficiently, and phases of wild type-like mutation rates, during which cells can be propagated without incurring a significant number of background mutations. Nyerges <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> reported the use of a temperature-controlled mismatch repair deficient strain (<italic>E. coli</italic> tMMR) in which the MMR machinery can be transiently inactivated by shifting cells to a non-permissive temperature (36&#x000b0;C) during oligonucleotide incorporation and cell recovery and then reactivated by returning cells to the permissive temperature (32&#x000b0;C) for propagation (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). This approach reduced the number of off-target mutations by 85%. In another work, Nyerges <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> developed pORTMAGE, a genome editing workflow that uses a dominant-negative <italic>mutL</italic> allele cloned on a broad-host range vector to transiently inactivate host MMR response using a similar temperature-dependent protocol (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The pORTMAGE system demonstrated high on-target mutation rates coupled with no reported off-target mutations. The plasmid-based nature of the system enabled transfer to other bacteria such as <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> and <italic>Citrobacter freundii</italic>. While both of these approaches reduce the off-target mutation rate, they restrict cell growth to 30&#x02013;32&#x000b0;C and hence increase the time between recombineering cycles. In contrast, during preparation of this manuscript Bubnov <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> reported the construction of a plasmid system with a dominant-negative <italic>mutS</italic> allele and a novel conditionally replicating origin that enabled plasmid propagation and genome editing at higher temperatures (e.g. 37&#x000b0;C) (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Finally, Lennen <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> developed a plasmid-based MAGE system, Transient Mutator Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (TM-MAGE). In TM-MAGE, <italic>E. coli</italic> Dam methylase is inducibly overexpressed to transiently limit MMR and thus enable high allelic replacement efficiencies with a 12&#x02013;33 fold lower off-target mutation rate than strains with fully disabled MMR (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p><p>To date, recombineering has advanced genome engineering in what can be categorized as two thematic research areas: developing genetic tools for model microbial hosts and multi-stage genome editing for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. These research areas have divergent requirements. In the former case, the portability of the recombineering vector is key to easily generate mutations across bacterial hosts and allow removal of the recombineering cassette following mutagenesis. Recombineering plasmids function as effective and convenient vectors for a portable genome engineering solution. In the latter case, a chromosomally integrated recombineering cassette has proven effective for multi-cycle recombineering up to dozens of rounds to simultaneously target many genomic loci related to an engineered function. Unfortunately, there is no chromosomally integrated recombineering system reported to date that achieves high-efficiency ssDNA recombination without the side-effect of a significantly elevated global mutagenesis rate. Hence, researchers still face a trade-off between genome editing efficiency and genome stability.</p><p>Here we present a rational genome engineering approach to develop a high-fidelity recombineering platform strain, called BioDesignER, with enhanced recombineering efficiency, low off-target mutagenesis rates, and short editing cycle times. We refactored the &#x003bb;-Red machinery in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655-derived EcNR1 to decrease cycle time and reduce toxicity, stacked genetic modifications shown to increase recombination rates, and characterized gene expression across the chromosome at curated integration loci, herein referred to as Safe Sites. We also introduced genomic modifications to independently control four transcriptional regulators of gene expression and characterized the induction regime for each regulator. We profiled the growth and ssDNA recombination rates of BioDesignER with a dual-fluorescent reporter cassette integrated at each Safe Site and also demonstrated the retention of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) recombination capabilities in the strain. We performed a comparative study of background mutagenesis rates of our strain and alternative platform strains using a fluorescent reporter-based fluctuation assay and found that BioDesignER exhibited a 4.2-fold lower mutagenesis rate compared to the widely used recombineering strain EcNR2. Finally, we compared the multi-cycle accumulation of targeted mutations for BioDesignER and other high-efficiency recombineering strains and found that BioDesignER exhibited similar multiplex editing efficiencies to EcNR2.nuc5-, a persistent mutator strain with the highest reported ssDNA recombination efficiency. BioDesignER is a high-fidelity genome engineering strain that uniquely enables high-efficiency recombineering while retaining a low basal mutagenesis rate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Chemicals, reagents and media</title><p>LB Lennox Medium (10 g/l Tryptone, 5 g/l Yeast Extract, 5 g/l NaCl; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was used to culture strains for experiments, to prepare electrocompetent cells for recombineering, and as recovery broth following electroporation.

However, while this exonuclease knockout strain, EcNR2.nuc5-, exhibited increased recombination efficiency, it also resulted in a lower post-electroporation growth rate compared to EcNR2. This suggested that deletion of the entire set of nucleases introduces to the strain an undesirable physiological defect. To avoid such growth defects, which are compounded for workflows requiring multiple recombineering cycles, we looked to systematically combine exonuclease knockouts that distinctly improve recombination rates.

Interestingly, we observed a much stronger correlation of expression to distance from replication origin for chromosome Arm 1, though mKate2 expression at Safe Site 8 was a low outlier. We also assessed the effect of integration at each Safe Site on cellular fitness by measuring growth rates for each integration strain. We observed that, in general, genomic integration and expression from each Safe Site did not reduce growth rate, though Safe Site 8 displayed a nominal decrease when grown under aTc induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). The two unexpected results at Safe Site 8 suggest that it may not be a reliable locus for integration&#x000a0;and expression.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-4-2"><title>Recombination rates across Safe Sites</title><p>Changes in local chromosomal structure may lead to unexpected fluctuations in recombination efficiency at various locations across the genome. To characterize recombination efficiency as a function of chromosomal locus for BioDesignER, we performed three independent ssDNA oligo-mediated recombination reactions for the panel of eight Safe Site strains.

We also performed a control reaction in each case using water in place of oligo. For Safe Sites that lie on opposite sides of the replication fork, we designed appropriate oligos to ensure recombination targeting the lagging strand. We found that recombination rates were consistently high across the chromosome with Safe Sites displaying, on average, single cycle, single site conversion rates of 17.0 &#x000b1; 6.7% and 19.7 &#x000b1; 5.7% for <italic>sfGFP</italic> and <italic>mKate</italic>2, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).

Consistent with prior work (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), we observed an increase in mutation rate for damOE under aTc induction - specifically, 2.4-fold in this work. Finally, we noted that even with aTc induction damOE was still less mutagenic than pTet-&#x003bb; <italic>&#x00394;mutS</italic>, suggesting that BioDesignER uniquely strikes a balance between on-target and off-target mutagenesis rates.</p><p>To quantify this balance, we compared the recombination and mutagenesis rates for a selection of control strains and BioDesignER (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The resulting trade-off space can be divided into two regimes where strains falling in the shaded region exhibit a favorable trade-off between recombination rate and mutation rate. BioDesignER falls in the favorable subspace, while MMR-deficient strains such as EcNR2 and pTet-&#x003bb; &#x00394;<italic>mutS</italic> fall in the unfavorable regime above the tradeoff line. To summarize this result, we introduce the metric recombineering fidelity, which we define as the product of fold-increase in recombination rate and fold-decrease in mutagenesis rate, each relative to EcNR2. Using this metric, we calculate that BioDesignER exhibits 7.3-fold greater recombineering fidelity than EcNR2 (1.75-fold improvement in recombination rate and 4.17-fold decrease in mutagenesis rate) (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="tbl2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Comparison of recombineering fidelity factors for relevant strains</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Strain</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Recombination efficiency (%)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mutation rate (mutations/cell/generation)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Recombineering fidelity</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Temperature (&#x000b0;C)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">pTet-&#x003bb;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.6 &#x000b1; 0.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.36 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">EcNR2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.5 &#x000b1; 2.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.73 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">BioDesignER</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.4 &#x000b1; 1.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.54 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="SEC3-6"><title>Multi-cycle recombineering rate enhancements</title><p>High single-cycle editing efficiency enables the rapid generation of genotypically diverse populations using multiplexed, cyclical recombineering workflows. To assess how well BioDesignER could generate a population with multiplex edits, we transformed a starting population with an oligo cocktail targeting multiple sites and tracked phenotypic diversity as a function of recombineering cycle for multiple strains. Specifically, we transformed BioDesignER harboring the <italic>sfGFP-mKate2</italic> fluorescence cassette with oligos to inactivate both reporters over four sequential recombineering cycles.

Regardless, while both BioDesignER and EcNR2.nuc5- exhibited similar multiplex editing efficiencies, EcNR2.nuc5- requires culturing at 30&#x02013;32&#x000b0;C and is a persistent mutator, which increases recombineering cycle time and basal mutation rate, respectively - thus limiting its overall utility as a reliable strain for multiplex genome editing.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="SEC4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>High-efficiency genome engineering in bacteria enables breadth (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and depth (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) explorations of genotypic diversity to enhance engineered behaviors. However, to date, no platform strain exists that incorporates a suite of core functions to provide efficient recombineering and regulate both genome engineering functions and cellular programs. BioDesignER is a high fidelity recombineering strain constructed to rapidly explore and optimize engineered functions. It incorporates many genomic modifications that increase recombination efficiency and reduce cycle time for recombineering workflows while minimizing off-target mutations. BioDesignER includes four independent inducible regulators to control recombineering and accommodate additional user designs. We have quantified the gene expression and targeted mutagenesis characteristics of eight Safe Site integration loci distributed across the genome and found seven Safe Sites suitable for engineering purposes.</p><p>BioDesignER enables rapid selection-based recombineering workflows with no requirements for plasmid transformation or curing. Reliable engineering of sequential genome integrations with established recombineering approaches, such as the use of plasmids pSIM5 (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) or pKD20 (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), require transformation and curing procedures of plasmid-encoded recombineering functions for each integration stage. These requirements increase the time required for individual genome editing steps by multiple days. Anecdotally, we have found plasmid-based recombineering systems unreliable for conducting multiple editing cycles from a single transformation of the recombineering plasmid. We speculate that the failure to achieve multi-cycle genome editing from plasmid-based recombineering solutions may be related to the accumulation of mutations spurred by the maintenance or leaky expression of &#x003bb;-Red genes over many generations. In contrast, we have completed all of the scar-free DNA recombineering workflows reported here with no restoration or replacement of the minimized pTet &#x003bb;-Red cassette.</p><p>We have increased recombineering fidelity in BioDesignER by striking a balance between recombination efficiency and mutagenesis rates. A high recombineering fidelity platform such as this may provide new avenues to multiplex genome remodeling using CRISPR-Cas9 techniques. CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing approaches in bacteria are limited by recombination efficiency to rescue double-stranded breaks. Linking CRISPR-Cas9 counterselection of native sequences with high-efficiency, multi-site recombineering may allow concurrent selection of many modifications from a large bacterial population with little off-target activity, thereby enabling researchers to explore unprecedented genetic diversity.</p><p>While BioDesignER exhibits robust functionalities with respect to recombineering fidelity, comparing the recombination efficiency of the BioDesignER lineage to EcNR2-derived strains reveals inconsistent results related to culture temperatures. Specifically, we found a nearly 2-fold reduction in recombination efficiency for BioDesignER at 30&#x000b0;C compared to 37&#x000b0;C, resulting in recombineering efficiencies similar to EcNR2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). This reduction suggests some uncharacterized dependence of recombination efficiency on temperature and could reflect reduced ssDNA access to the replication fork, lower ssDNA half-life at reduced temperatures, or perhaps temperature-dependent expression of the &#x003bb;-Red machinery from pTet.</p><p>While constructing BioDesignER, we developed multiple selection/counter-selection strategies that may be of general use for bacterial genome engineering. These strategies combine selection/counter-selection and fluorescence screening components to accelerate scar-free genome engineering. Specifically, the genetic cassettes utilize selection/counter-selection of <italic>thyA</italic>, building on work from FRUIT (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). This approach requires two recombineering transformations: a dsDNA integration of the fluorescence-coupled <italic>thyA</italic> cassette at the target genomic locus followed by removal of the cassette using ssDNA or dsDNA. The genetic modification of interest can be incorporated at either integration stage. In comparison, CRISPR-based genome editing workflows, which are gaining popularity, require multiple steps including guide plasmid construction, co-transformation with Cas9, and subsequent curing. Thus, the selection/counter selection methodologies developed here allow a simple and effective approach to genome engineering. Finally, as a resource to the bioengineering community we have generated a variant of BioDesignER (RE1000) with no antibiotic resistance genes (<italic>&#x00394;ampR</italic>).</p><p>Development of BioDesignER points to genome design strategies for next-generation biotechnology hosts. As synthetic biology matures, the application space is expanding beyond prototypical genetic circuits and metabolic pathways in laboratory environments to robust engineered functions in ecologies with high biotic and abiotic complexity, including soil, wastewater, and the human gut (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Efficient and sustained activity of engineered functions in these environments will require programmed behaviors to be optimized in phylogenetically diverse microbes. We anticipate the integrative approach used to develop and characterize BioDesignER can be a template to develop high-efficiency recombineering platforms for new bacterial hosts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="gkz085_supplemental_files.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ACK1"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to thank Vivek Mutalik for providing the <italic>cymR</italic> expression construct and the core promoter sequence used to design the Tet-based &#x003bb;-Red expression system.
