For trioecious papaya (<italic>Carica papaya</italic>), highly differentiated morphology of gynoecium in flowers of different sex types is controlled by gene networks and influenced by environmental factors, but the regulatory mechanism in gynoecium morphogenesis is unclear. Gynodioecious and dioecious papaya varieties were used for analysis of differentially expressed genes followed by experiments using auxin and an auxin transporter inhibitor. We first compared differential gene expression in functional and rudimentary gynoecium at early stage of their development and detected significant difference in phytohormone modulating and transduction processes, particularly auxin. Enhanced auxin signal transduction in rudimentary gynoecium was observed. To determine the role auxin plays in the papaya gynoecium, auxin transport inhibitor (N-1-Naphthylphthalamic acid, NPA) and synthetic auxin analogs with different concentrations gradient were sprayed to the trunk apex of male and female plants of dioecious papaya. Weakening of auxin transport by 10&#x02009;mg/L NPA treatment resulted in female fertility restoration in male flowers, while female flowers did not show changes. NPA treatment with higher concentration (30 and 50&#x02009;mg/L) caused deformed flowers in both male and female plants. We hypothesize that the occurrence of rudimentary gynoecium patterning might associate with auxin homeostasis alteration. Proper auxin concentration and auxin homeostasis might be crucial for functional gynoecium morphogenesis in papaya flowers. These results will lead to further investigation on the auxin homeostasis and gynoecium morphogenesis in papaya.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>Flowering</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>This work was supported by startup fund from Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University and the NSF Plant Genome Research Program Award 1546890.

Male flowers arose due to the occurrence of female sterility (gynoecium abortion) and male fertility in hermaphroditic flower ancestors. It was also evolutionarily benefited from male&#x02013;female mating strategies to maintain offspring genetic diversity by promoting pollen dispersal in population, although a seemingly futile strategies for agriculture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The transition from hermaphroditic ancestors to male in populations caused by genetic mutations in genomic sequence was common, while reverse to hermaphrodite is rare. The past studies have provided convincing evidence of sex reversal, such as papaya<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Gynoecium morphogenesis are resulted from the temporal&#x02013;spatial interactions of genes (such as homeobox transcription factors) and phytohormones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. From previous reports, it can be inferred that the lability in gynoecium morphogenesis was associated with ecological environment or climatic change. The adverse environmental conditions, such as deficit of light, water, or nutrition, often favor maleness in dioecious, androdioecious, and monoecious plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The environmental changes coupled with phytohormones imbalance would easily induce floral organ abortion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. All of these have attracted biologists to understand the possible inherited and environmental regulatory mechanism of gynoecium morphogenesis in plants.</p><p id="Par4">Trioecious papaya is an excellent system to explore the genetic and environmental regulatory mechanism for gynoecium development. This tropical fruit crop has three sex forms, which display different features of gynoecium morphogenesis in populations. For wild population, trees are female (functional gynoecium) and male (rudimentary gynoecium). For cultivated varieties, there are predominantly hermaphroditic trees (restorations of rudimentary gynoecium in flower) by removing their female counterpart, because of their economic importance and pollination efficiency. Several studies revealed that XY nascent sex chromosome system control the sex in papaya. The sex chromosome combination in female is XX, while that of male and hermaphrodite is XY and XY<sup>h</sup>, respectively. Hermaphrodite papaya diverged from its male wild papaya ancestors recently, and was a product of human domestication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, we still do not have a candidate gene disrupting and restoring functional gynoecium development in male and hermaphrodite papaya. Beyond that, it is an unstable system, because the hermaphroditic to male-like flowers or complete reversal of male to hermaphrodite flowers are common under continuous high or low temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. It is also unclear how the environmental factors affect the target gene or genes resulting in these noticeable changes.</p><p id="Par5">Interestingly, in hermaphroditic papaya, temperature has great influence in gynoecium fertility. In spring, the trees always bear one dominant perfect flower with normal androecium and gynoecium on the top of small inflorescence and few auxiliary/secondary male-like (female sterile) flowers on both sides. While in summer, female sterility occur with rudimentary gynoecium in dominant hermaphroditic flower, while the female papaya exhibits the strong tolerance to summer stress. However, in autumn, with temperature alleviation, the dominant hermaphroditic flowers with normal as well as rudimentary gynoecium initiated simultaneously on individual plants.</p><p id="Par6">Our aim is to identify the regulatory mechanisms related to gynoecium morphogenesis in papaya through the clues of metabolism changes by differential gene expression analysis. Comparing the transcriptome of rudimentary gynoecium with the functional ones, we found that the expression of genes involving in auxin signal transduction was enhanced in rudimentary gynoecium. Weakening the auxin flow is sufficient to restore gynoecium development in male flowers. The study elucidated a genetic and environmental regulatory mechanism in gynoecium morphogenesis for papaya.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant material</title><p id="Par7">Gynodioecious papaya variety &#x0201c;Zhongbai&#x0201d; and dioecious papaya variety &#x0201c;Zhonghuang&#x0201d; were planted in the research station of Fujian Agriculrture and Forestry University (FAFU).

There was a clearly defined enrichment in auxin signal transduction. In TIR1/AFB-Aux/IAA-ARF auxin signaling pathway, TIR1/AFB (TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX PROTEIN) is a core subunit of SCF multi-protein E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and acts as an intracellular receptor.

Aux/IAA(AUXIN/INDOLE ACETIC ACID, auxin response factors transcriptional repressors) genes showed decreased expression pattern in these rudimentary samples, which maintained Aux/IAA protein content at a relatively low level in the cells and further promote the transcription of ARF(AUXIN RESPONSIVE FACTORS) and ARF-mediated early auxin response genes (SAURs and GH3.9) as well as increase the auxin effect. And the decrease in transcript expression of some GH3s involving in auxin conjugation, such as GH 3.1 and GH3.6, suggested there would be more accumulation of active auxin conferring a continuous auxin stimulus in rudimentary gynoecium.

In this study, differential gene expression pattern between functional and rudimentary gynoecium revealed that gynoecium morphologenesis and development are associated with three main biological processes, including (i) response to stimulus which may induce abnormalities, unbalanced phytohormone distribution, ectopic transcription factor modulation, and aberrant cell proliferation growth; (ii) response to growth and development, which may be associated with female gametophyte and fertilization-independent development; and (iii) reponse to phytohormones. Of these, the phytohormone responsive DEGs seem to be more critical. KEGG enrichment of DEGs implied that phytohormones signaling transduction was the most significant enrichment pathway when compared functional and rudimentary gynoecium. More importantly, auxin-related DEGs were all highlighted in known signal transmission processes, suggesting that auxin had a much greater influence than other hormones on regulation of gynoecium morphogenesis.</p><p id="Par33">Conversion from functional gynoecium to rudimentary gynoecium in papaya seems to be related to over-accumulation in auxin, instead of deficiency in auxin. In rudimentary gynoecium samples, the mRNA levels of auxin influx carrier AUX1, auxin receptor TIR were upregulated, coupling with increased transcription of auxin response genes like <italic>SAURs</italic> and <italic>GH3s</italic>, which might be triggered by accumulation of extracellular auxin. And the decrease in transcript expression of gene participated in auxin conjugation and efflux will further keep up a consistently high content of active auxin in cells. The same situation occurs in rudimentary gynoecium of male and hermaphrodite flowers, when compared to the one of female flowers and perfect hermaphrodite flowers. It was therefore suggested that auxin accumulation might be associated with gynoecium morphogenesis anomalies. This was confirmed by exogenous NPA application through weakening of polar auxin flow in male flower which partially restored the defects of gynoecium development.</p><p id="Par34">The phytohormone auxin plays a crucial role in organs morphogenesis. Recent reports have unraveled that morphogenetic processes of flower and leaf primordium occurred in the certain site of peripheral zone rather than the central undifferentiated cells and waiting meristem cells in shoot apical meristem tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In these positions, auxin temporal-spatial distribution and homeostasis, including the orientation, timing and pattern of auxin maxima or minima, presage the new organs primordium formation and guide the further morphogenesis through pre-patterning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Deficiency in auxin signaling and transport could influence gynoecium development. In our experiment, with excessive application of NPA, severe blocking of the auxin stream in shoots of female papaya made few flowers bore a stalk-like gynoecium with stigma. This phenotype appeared to resemble to Arabidopsis mutants which were deficit in auxin signaling and transport. Attenuation of auxin signaling in <italic>ETT</italic> (<italic>ARF3</italic> mutant) caused an expansile basal gynophore, stylar and stigma, as well as diminished ovary valves, like a thin stalk topped with stigma anlages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Disruption of polar auxin transportation in PIN (auxin efflux carrier) and PID (a kinase phosphorylate PIN and direct PIN&#x02019;s distribution) mutant resulted in stalk-like gynoecium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Stalk-like gynoecium caused by disruption of polar auxin transport is different from rudimentary gynoecium in male flowers or hermaphroditic auxiliary flower of papaya. NPA-meditated deficit in auxin transport and signaling only made the female flowers with functional gynoecium bear stalk-like gynoecium structure. But, in contrast, after weakening auxin transport and signaling, female restoration of male flowers has proved the necessity of decreasing auxin transport and signaling in sex reversal of male to hermaphrodite flowers.</p><p id="Par35">Our observation of the differences between functional gynoecium and rudimentary gynoecium in hermaphroditic flowers after the hot summer help us underline the environmental effects on gynoecium development. As far as we know, auxin was not only involved in organs morphogenesis, but also discovered to be implicated in the response and resistance against unfavorable environment. Many studies were reported that auxin accumulation in Arabidopsis seedlings especially for adverse conditions, such as high temperature and vegetative shading. An accumulation in auxin production resulted in elongation of hypocotyl and leaf petiole while seedling grew in elevated temperature or shade conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. So the excessive auxin may contribute to gynoecium morphogenesis anomalies in hermaphroditic flower under high temperature conditions, considering that floral organs have evolutionarily derived from leaves.</p><p id="Par36">Based on our transcriptional expression analyses of auxin-related signaling genes and experiments using auxin transport inhibitor, we proposed a hypothetical model that auxin homeostasis determines the highly differentiated morphology of gynoecium in papaya flowers. In our model (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), an optimal level of auxin was necessary for the correct morphogenesis of functional gynoecium. The occurrence of rudimentary gynoecium in male flower might be caused by excessive accumulation of auxin, and the female fertility restoration in NPA-induced male-to-hermaphrodite transformed flowers is likely due to weakening of polar auxin flow to the optimum level critical for functional gynoecium development. For female flowers, the same NPA treatment, reducing endogenous auxin content to critically low concentration, led to the emergence of stalk-like gynoecium. As the spray concentration increases, severe blockage of auxin transport under excessive NPA application (very low auxin) ultimately resulted in deformed flowers in both male and female.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Model shows how auxin affects the gynoecium morphogenesis in papaya.</title><p><bold>a</bold> 1. Optimal level of auxin is critical for functional gynoecium development 2. Auxin transport inhibitor (NPA) treatment to male flower resulted in polar auxin flow weakening that might drop the auxin concentration to critical level for functional gynoecium development and result in sex reversal from male flower to perfect hermaphrodite flower 3. NPA application to female flower resulted in critically low auxin concentration with the development of stalk-like gynoecium structure (non-functional) completely different from rudimentary gynoecium 4 &#x00026; 5. A smaller increase in auxin concentration under auxin analogs application resulted in no changes in both male and female flowers. <bold>b</bold> Hermaphrodite flowers are easily influenced by environment (temperature) comparing to both male and female 1. In summer, increased temperature may result in increased auxin level with the development of rudimentary gynoecium 2. While, in autumn, decrease in temperature may cause the development of functional gynoecium due to drop in auxin level to the critical level for functional gynoecium development</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41438_2019_205_Fig6_HTML" id="d29e699"/></fig></p><p id="Par37">In hermaphrodite flowers, auxin homeostasis alteration can also explain the conversion from functional gynoecium to rudimentary gynoecium. It was reported that, for gynodioecious variety &#x0201c;Sunrise&#x0201d;, the endogenous auxin contents in hermaphrodite flowers with rudimentary gynoecium was highest while that in female and hermaphrodite flowers with functional gynoecium were lower<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Under the same genetic background, high concentration of auxin in hermaphrodite flowers coincides with the phenotype of rudimentary gynoecium, suggesting that auxin homeostasis alteration have a significant impact on gynoecium morphogenesis in hermaphrodite flowers. Given that high temperature has induced auxin accumulation in Arabidopsis seedlings, we infer that excessive auxin accumulation caused by temperature change led to rudimentary gynoecium.</p><p id="Par38">Our hypothetical model summarizes all the findings in this study and emphasizes the influence of auxin homeostasis on gynoecium morphogenesis in papaya flowers of different sex types. If this hypothesis is correct, we are inclined to believe that it is a gene on the Y chromosome that caused excessive auxin accumulation in male flower, and the increase of auxin content triggered by unfavorable environmental conditions might result in the rudimentary gynoecium in hermaphrodite flower.</p><p id="Par39">In conclusion, the transcriptome analysis and NPA treatment demonstrated that auxin played an important role in papaya gynoecium morphogenesis. The results showed that proper auxin concentration and auxin homeostasis were necessary for functional gynoecium development. However, the gynoecium tissue is pretty small at the early flower stage and arduous to separate, making it difficult to collect enough samples acquired for endogenous auxin content measurement. Therefore, our next step is to detect its auxin content in flowers of different sex types, especially in flowers of male-to-hermaphrodite sex reversal papaya mutants reported in our previous research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, to prove our hypothesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec12"><p>
