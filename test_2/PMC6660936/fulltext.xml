We show that Cas9-mediated editing is more efficient in open chromatin regions than in closed chromatin regions in rice. A construct (Cas9-TV) formed by fusing a synthetic transcription activation domain to Cas9 edits target sites more efficiently, even in closed chromatin regions. Moreover, combining Cas9-TV with a proximally binding dead sgRNA (dsgRNA) further improves editing efficiency up to several folds. The use of Cas9-TV/dsgRNA thus provides a novel strategy for obtaining efficient genome editing in vivo, especially at nuclease-refractory target sites.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s13059-019-1762-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>CRISPR/Cas9</kwd><kwd>Chromatin accessibility</kwd><kwd>Transcription activation domain</kwd><kwd>Proximal dsgRNA</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the National Transgenic Science and Technology Program of China </institution></funding-source><award-id>2016ZX08010-002, 2018ZX0801002B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qiu</surname><given-names>Jin-Long</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par2">The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been widely and successfully used for genome engineering in diverse eukaryotic species and is revolutionizing biology and providing powerful tools for gene therapy and plant breeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, the efficiency of editing at different genomic loci varies greatly, both in animal and plant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The low CRISPR/Cas9 editing efficiency at some sites limits the availability of in vivo targets and thereby constrains further applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">Unlike the prokaryotic DNA that Cas9 evolved to target, eukaryotic genomic DNA is wrapped around histones and further compacted to form higher-order chromatin structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] that may hinder the binding of Cas9 to its targets. Genome-wide mapping of the binding sites of catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) in mammalian cells revealed that they were enriched in open chromatin regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Moreover, the production of CRISPR/Cas9-induced insertions and deletions (indels) in human cells was higher at sites in open chromatin regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In vitro and in vivo experiments have demonstrated that Cas9 binding and cleavage are inhibited by nucleosomes, the basic units of chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In agreement with this, Cas9-mediated genome editing was more efficient in euchromatic than in heterochromatic regions in HEK293T, HeLa, and human fibroblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Interestingly, chromatin structure had an even more pronounced inhibitory effect on the off-target activity of CRISPR/Cas9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In contrast, chromatin accessibility was not found to affect CRISPR/Cas9 activity in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Whether chromatin accessibility affects Cas9 editing in plant cells is not yet known.</p><p id="Par4">There have been some attempts to alter local accessibility to improve Cas9 activity in vivo. The proxy-CRISPR strategy uses an additional catalytically dead SpCas9 (dCas9) to bind at proximal locations. This rendered target sites accessible to FnCas9, CjCas9, NcCas9, and FnCpf1 and thus improved the editing efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, this method relies on the genome being accessible to SpCas9 and requires co-expression of two different CRISPR/Cas systems, which inevitably increases vector size and the difficulty of in vivo application. Recently, a method called CRISPR-chrom, in which Cas9 orthologs are fused with chromatin-modulating peptides (CMPs), substantially improved Cas9 editing efficiency, particularly at refractory sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. CMPs are truncated forms of endogenous proteins, and it is not yet known whether their overexpression can have dominant negative effects. Probably a variety of approaches are needed to gain full access to eukaryotic DNA for editing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Here, we describe several lines of evidence indicating that Cas9 genome editing efficiency is correlated with chromatin accessibility in rice cells. We fused a synthetic transcription activation domain to Cas9, generating the construct Cas9-TV. This fusion significantly improved Cas9-mediated genome editing efficiency in both open and closed chromatin regions. Furthermore, when Cas9-TV was combined with proximally targeting dead sgRNAs (dsgRNAs), even higher genome editing efficiencies were obtained.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cas9 genome editing is more efficient in open chromatin regions of rice</title><p id="Par6">We used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to edit 41 rice genes with 70 sgRNAs (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1).

The insertion/deletion (indel) frequencies induced by CRISPR/Cas9 at various target sites were quite variable (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). We then analyzed whether the indel frequencies were associated with chromatin accessibility. Open chromatin is DNase I hypersensitive (DH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and comprehensive DNase I hypersensitivity data for the rice genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] are available. Using these data, we found that the frequencies of Cas9-induced indels at the target sites we tested were significantly higher at DH sites (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a), suggesting that CRISPR/Cas9 activity in rice is affected by chromatin openness. To confirm that chromatin structure influences Cas9 editing in rice, we tested another 20 genes in open and closed chromatin regions based on the rice open chromatin map [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

Pairwise comparisons of indel frequencies at these sites revealed that Cas9 activity was higher in open chromatin regions than in closed chromatin regions by factors of up to 13.4-fold, while the indel frequencies induced by different sgRNAs were highly variable (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, b).

VP16, a transcription activation domain, can induce remodeling and unfolding of condensed chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, dCas9-VP64 (with four copies of VP16) can activate expression of target genes even in closed chromatin regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This led us to suppose that fusion of Cas9 with a transcription activation domain might improve Cas9 editing efficiency in the context of chromatin. To test this hypothesis, a synthetic transcription activation domain (thereafter called TV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], which contains six copies of the TAD (transcription activation domain) of the TALE (transcription activator-like effector) protein AvrBs3 from <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> and eight copies of VP16, was fused to the C-terminus of Cas9 to generate Cas9-TV (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). The genome editing efficiency of Cas9-TV was investigated in rice protoplasts with the 20 sgRNAs that target different chromatin regions (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2). The indel frequencies induced by Cas9 and Cas9-TV at the target sites ranged from 1.95 to 29.56% and 3.81 to 44.85%, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b), and the genome editing efficiency of Cas9-TV was higher than that of Cas9 at all sites tested (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c).

Dead sgRNAs (dsgRNAs) with 14- or 15-base-pair (bp) spacer sequences can guide Cas9 to target sites without inducing double-strand breaks (DSBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Hence, proximal dsgRNAs might increase the accessibility of Cas9-TV to target genomic loci (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3), similar to that of proximal CRISPR targeting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To test this idea, we used the 20 sgRNAs targeting sites in the rice genome (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2) and designed dsgRNAs targeting proximal sites near each one (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4). The distances between sgRNA targeting sites and dsgRNA binding sites ranged from 32 to 92&#x02009;bp. When each of the combinations of dsgRNA with sgRNA or sgRNA alone was transformed along with Cas9-TV or Cas9 into rice protoplasts, the proximal dsgRNA improved the efficiency of Cas9-TV editing at all the target sites (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). On average, the indel frequency obtained with Cas9-TV combined with a proximal dsgRNA was 1.5-fold higher than that with Cas9-TV, and 2.5-fold higher than that with Cas9 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). As expected, we detected no indels at the dsgRNA targeting sites (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4). The proximal dsgRNAs stimulated Cas9-TV editing in both open and closed chromatin regions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c, d) and did not affect the patterns of indels induced by Cas9-TV (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5).

We found that both Cas9-TV and dsgRNA targeting increased chromatin accessibility at the targeted sites, and the combination had an even greater effect at each of the sites (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). These results indicate that Cas9-TV, proximal dsgRNA, and Cas9-TV/dsgRNA are able to increase chromatin accessibility at in vivo target sites, and their effectiveness in this respect seems to be correlated with the efficiency with which they perform genome editing.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Cas9-TV and proximal dsgRNA alter local chromatin accessibility.

In this analysis, using the online tool, CRISPR-P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], three potential off-target (OT) sites with 2 to 4 mismatches were identified for sgRNAs 24 and 28, respectively, as well as four off-target sites for sgRNA38 and five for sgRNA34 (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S6). Cas9-TV again had higher on-target activity than Cas9 at all the target sites (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). On the other hand, even though Cas9, Cas9-TV, and Cas9-TV/dsgRNA induced indels at the OT24-2 site for sgRNA24 and OT34-1 site for sgRNA34, their frequencies were similar, and none of the nucleases induced significant numbers of indels at the OT24-1 and OT24-3 sites for sgRNA24; at the OT28-1 and OT28-2 sites for sgRNA28; at the OT34-2, OT34-3, OT34-4, and OT34-5 sites for sgRNA34; and at the off-target sites for sgRNA38. Surprisingly, indel frequencies induced by Cas9-TV and Cas9-TV/dsgRNA were lower than those by Cas9 at the OT28-3 site (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).

Since the spacer sequence also contributes to Cas9-mediated editing efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], we used sgRNAs that targeted sites in distinct chromatin states. This strategy excluded the effect of spacer sequence bias on genome editing efficiency and confirmed that Cas9-mediated genome editing efficiency was higher in open chromatin regions. There is growing focus on the effect of chromatin states on genome editing efficiency in different eukaryotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, methods to manipulate chromatin accessibility to enhance genome editing in vivo remain limited. Here, we have developed Cas9-TV, a hybrid protein generated by fusing a synthetic transcription domain (TV) to Cas9, as a strategy to modulate chromatin structure and enhance editing efficiency. Moreover, targeting with dsgRNAs around 120&#x02009;bp proximal to the cleavage site further substantially increased editing efficiency at all sites tested. We conclude that Cas9-TV together with proximal dsgRNA targeting provides a robust method for enhancing genome editing efficiency in rice.</p><p id="Par14">Interestingly, both Cas9-TV and Cas9-TV/dsgRNA enhance editing equally in open and closed chromatin regions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c, d). This may be a result of the dynamic nature of chromatin structure: nucleosomes themselves are highly dynamic and often undergo &#x0201c;site exposure&#x0201d; conformational fluctuations that transiently allow or prevent access of DNA binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Genome-wide ATAC-seq profiling has also revealed dynamic changes in chromatin state from open to closed and closed to open during the production of human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In the present study, when targets were in a fully open (chromatin-free) configuration, Cas9 cleaved them almost completely (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). However, the in vivo editing efficiencies at these target sites were quite variable (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), even though Cas9-TV/dsgRNA switched chromatin structure to a more open state (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). This suggests that chromatin openness is relative and that there are temporal windows for nuclease (Cas9 or Cas9-TV) binding in both open and closed chromatin. When Cas9-TV binds to a target in an &#x0201c;open&#x0201d; temporal window, it promotes a more open chromatin configuration in the vicinity. Chromatin structure actually involves an alternation between open and closed states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and making use of factors that effect this alternation may further improve access of Cas9 to target DNA. For example, trichostatin A (TSA), which modulates chromatin structure by inhibiting histone deacetylase, has been successfully used in the induction of iPS cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and it should be worthwhile to examine its effect on genome editing in various other types of cell.</p><p id="Par15">Our method has some advantages over others as a method for stimulating editing. For example, the proxy-CRISPR method uses two CRISPR/Cas systems, which inevitably increases vector size and reduces protoplast transformation efficiency. In the CRISPR-chrom method, the chromosome-modulating peptides originate from mammalian cells and may not work in plants. However, since the TV domain is effective as a transcriptional activator in yeast, plants, and animals, and dCas9-TV is also effective in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], we speculate that combinations of Cas9-TV and Cas9-TV with dsgRNA will work in many types of eukaryotic cell. Moreover, while these constructs enhance genome editing efficiency, they do not increase off-target effects. The fact that our sgRNA-dsgRNA strategy improves genome editing in plants also suggests that two or more sgRNAs binding at nearby sites of the same target gene may have synergist effects, so that it might not be necessary to use the sgRNA-dsgRNA strategy when employing more than one sgRNA to target the same gene.</p><p id="Par16">Other CRISPR/Cas systems are being discovered and engineered for genome editing in eukaryotes. However, some of them have low activity in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Since fusing TV to Cas9 can improve editing efficiency, this strategy may also work for other CRISPR/Cas systems, such as SaCas9 or Cas12a (formerly Cpf1), in plants. Nonetheless, our method also has some limitations. For example, binding of Cas9-TV may activate genes around the sgRNA and dsgRNA target sites. This may be particularly important when using Cas9-TV/dsgRNA to generate gene-edited plants, since these might have phenotypes caused by Cas9-TV/dsgRNA-mediated gene activation rather than editing. However, this side effect can be eliminated by transient expression of the editing components or isolating transgene-free plants. Additionally, there are most probably factors other than chromatin structures that affect genome editing efficiency in vivo, and not all closed target sites are efficiently edited by Cas9-TV/dsgRNA. Together, these considerations imply that efforts should continue to produce more powerful and universal genome editing tools.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par17">In this study, we describe a new strategy for improving CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing efficiency in rice by fusing a synthetic transcription activation domain (TV) to Cas9. This fusion protein, Cas9-TV, increased editing efficiency at all the target sites tested. Moreover, adding a proximal dsgRNA further improved the editing efficiency by up to fourfold. Importantly, Cas9-TV and Cas9-TV/dsgRNA stimulated editing at sites in both open and closed chromatin regions. In addition, the off-target effects of Cas9-TV were similar to those of Cas9.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p id="Par18">The VP64 and 2TAL (two copies of the TAD of the TALE protein AvrBs3 from <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic>) coding sequences were codon-optimized for rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) and synthesized commercially (GenScript, Nanjing, China).
