While SNV detection from abundant single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is applicable and cost-effective in identifying expressed variants, inferring sub-clones, and deciphering genotype-phenotype linkages, there is a lack of computational methods specifically developed for SNV calling in scRNA-seq.

While the specificities are generally high, with sensitivities exceeding 90% for most tools when calling homozygous SNVs in high-confident coding regions with sufficient read depths, such sensitivities dramatically decrease when calling SNVs with low read depths, low variant allele frequencies, or in specific genomic contexts. SAMtools shows the highest sensitivity in most cases especially with low supporting reads, despite the relatively low specificity in introns or high-identity regions.

SNVs could be faithfully propagated from progenitors to daughter cells during DNA replication and thus have been commonly used to delineate the heterogeneity and phylogenetic relationship of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Next generation sequencing is by far the most useful technology to detect mutations for its ability to screen SNVs in a high-throughput manner. SNVs could be detected from the whole genome sequencing (WGS) or whole exome sequencing (WES), and then be utilized to infer clonal architecture or to construct the evolutionary relationships of tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Accordingly, in single-cell studies, SNV detection is a compelling strategy to decipher the heterogeneity of cell compositions and to infer the lineage relationships. Although single-cell WGS (scWGS) or single-cell WES (scWES) experiments could be performed to detect single-cell SNVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], there are substantial challenges which hamper the large-scale application of such experiments. Indeed, the sparse distribution of SNVs throughout the genome might lead to a substantial proportion of SNVs undetected in single-cell experiments. In addition, numerous biases can be introduced by amplification methods that could be error prone, thus failing to provide equal coverage across the genome. Furthermore, the relatively high cost of these experiments hinders the large-scale application of such methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">In contrast, scRNA-seq has been recently exploding with the continuous technological innovation and constantly increasing throughput with decreasing costs. It has been widely used for its capability of revealing complex and rare cell populations, uncovering regulatory relationships between genes, and tracking the trajectories of distinct cell lineages in development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Most of these analyses were based on the transcriptome data with quantified gene expression as features, which could be influenced by different technical factors such as sequencing platforms, batch effects, and dropouts, while the detection of genetic variations such as SNVs is orthogonal to such expression-based analysis, thus potentially increasing the value of the rich resource of scRNA-seq data. Importantly, SNVs may help to unravel the heterogeneity of tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and genotype-phenotype associations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. When considering diseases including cancer, expressed mutations are of greater interest because they could affect cellular processes more directly and their functions are more clearly illustrated. In addition, detecting SNVs from scRNA-seq data with quantified expression further enables the study of allelic expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and manifests the effects of SNVs on gene expression by cis and/or trans effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, identifying SNVs from scRNA-seq could be used to find RNA-editing events and to validate DNA sequence variations. Recently, the mitochondria DNA mutations derived from scRNA-seq were reported to be a powerful and scalable strategy to assess cellular dynamics of native human cells, thus providing a natural barcode to infer clonal relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, detecting variants from scRNA-seq data seems to be a powerful and cost-effective approach, which could not only identify the expressed variants directly, but also simultaneously reveal the relationships of DNA alteration and RNA expression at the single-cell level.</p><p id="Par7">In spite of its importance, significant challenges exist for detecting variants from scRNA-seq data. The sequencing coverages are usually limited, and it is more difficult to detect variants from the transcriptome than from DNA sequences due to RNA splicing. In addition, the dynamic nature of RNAs, the higher error rate from reverse transcription, and the greater number of PCR cycles could lead to false positives. Despite these challenges, SNV detection based on scRNA-seq data has been performed by existing methods that were originally developed for bulk RNA-seq data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], due to the lack of tools specifically designated for scRNA-seq. However, the accuracies and specificities of these methods need to be evaluated considering the enormous challenges of RNA-based SNV detection. Indeed, while benchmarking for detecting SNVs from bulk RNA-seq data has been performed with limited tools and methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], there is no systematic comparison of SNV detection from scRNA-seq to our knowledge. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to evaluate the performance of variant detection tools employed in RNA-seq data at single-cell level.</p><p id="Par8">In this study, we perform systematic comparative analysis of seven widely used SNV-calling methods, including SAMtools, the GATK Best Practices pipeline, CTAT, FreeBayes, MuTect2, Strelka2, and VarScan2, on both simulated and real single-cell RNA-seq datasets. We evaluate the performances of these tools in different read depths, genomic contexts, functional regions, and variant allele frequencies. We also investigate the consistency of performances for different tissue origins, as well as the impact of sequencing protocols. This study can serve as a valuable benchmark and guideline for selecting the suitable software for SNV detection in scRNA-seq.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview of variant-calling methods for RNA sequencing data</title><p id="Par9">The conventional SNV-calling pipeline for high-throughput transcriptome sequencing generally consists of four components: mapping, pre-processing, variant evaluation, and post-filtering. RNA-seq reads are usually mapped to the reference genome using a splice-aware mapper. The Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) aligner is recommended by the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) Best Practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It performs sequential maximum mappable seed searches, seed clustering, and stitching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Genomic Short-read Nucleotide Alignment Program (GSNAP) is also widely used in scRNA-seq for its tolerance of complex variants and splicing for both short and long sequence reads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Pre-processing procedures, including removing duplicates, realigning, reassigning mapping qualities, and recalibrating base quality scores, could eliminate low-quality reads and improve the accuracy of variant calling. Variant evaluation is the key step, in which reliable candidates are obtained with the best performing software for downstream analysis, and thus, it is the focus of our benchmarking. Post-filtering aims to rule out the false-positive calls from diverse sources, including low quality (probability) of SNVs, low-complexity regions, and low read depths, and to retain high-confident SNVs.</p><p id="Par10">MuTect2, Strelka2, and VarScan2 have been widely used to detect variants in bulk RNA-seq data. MuTect2 combines the DREAM challenge-winning somatic genotyping engine with HaplotypeCaller, allowing for a varying allelic fraction and several harder filters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Strelka2 utilizes mixture model-based parameter estimation and an efficient tiered haplotype-modeling strategy for variant detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. VarScan2 applies a heuristic and statistical algorithm to detect and classify sequence variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Although these three tools have not been used for single-cell SNV detection, we included them in our benchmarking of scRNA-seq, considering their extensive utilization.</p><p id="Par11">The GATK Best Practices for variant calling on RNA-seq data is the most frequently used framework for detecting variations in single-cell RNA-seq, in which there are two tools for variant evaluation, UnifiedGenotyper and HaplotypeCaller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. HaplotypeCaller is more recent and sophisticated and is recommended by GATK. Notably, Trinity Cancer Transcriptome Analysis Toolkit (CTAT), the software developed for scRNA-seq SNV detection, was based on the GATK Best Practices pipeline. In addition, SSrGE, developed to link effective and expressed nucleotide variations associated with gene expression in scRNA-seq data, utilizes a module for identifying variants based on GATK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Apart from the GATK framework, SAMtools has also been used to examine SNVs in scRNA-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Pysam, which functions based on SAMtools, is another approach utilized to explore variations in scRNA-seq data. For instance, Ludwig et al. detected mitochondrial mutations with the pysam module and showed that the allele frequencies estimated from scRNA-seq were consistent with those estimated from whole genome sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Other tools, including FreeBayes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and BamBam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], have also been sporadically used for variant detection in scRNA-seq data, although these tools were originally designed for bulk sequencing and have not been adapted for scRNA-seq data. Notably, BamBam and other callers, like JointSNVMix, Seurat, and SomaticSniper, were not included in our benchmarking, as they require paired normal data to call variants from RNA-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Performance evaluation of variant callers on real data</title><p id="Par14">We generated full-length transcriptome data of 291 CD45<sup>&#x02212;</sup> single cells with SMART-seq2 protocol. Among these CD45<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells, 70 were identified as malignant cells (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), which were derived from two colorectal cancer patients (P0411 and P0413). The average sequencing depths of these cells were 1.4 million reads per cell. Germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be identified from bulk exome sequencing (Exome-seq) data and are expected to occur in each of the single cells, and thus, the SNPs detected from bulk Exome-seq can be used as gold standard for single-cell variant calling. Therefore, we also generated bulk WES data of tumor and adjacent normal tissues for these two patients.</p><p id="Par15">To generate gold standard variants from bulk WES data, we aligned reads using the BWA-PICARD pipeline and called SNPs using VarScan2 after filtering out low-quality sequencing reads. To validate the reliability of these SNPs, we further generated bulk RNA-seq data of tumor tissue for patient P0411 and detected SNPs from bulk RNA-seq data by aligning reads with STAR and calling SNPs with SAMtools. We found that of all the 5861 sufficiently expressed (read depths &#x0003e;&#x02009;5 in RNA-seq data) benchmark SNPs called from bulk WES, 97.8% (5827/5861) could also be independently identified from bulk RNA-seq data, supporting the reliability of our benchmark SNPs.</p><p id="Par16">Genetic variants can be classified into homozygous and heterozygous variants, both of which could provide valuable insights on gene function and could cause pathogenic phenotypes. However, the heterozygous variants might be inconsistent between Exome-seq and RNA-seq data, due to either the lack of sensitivities of the variant-calling methods or the widespread allele-specific expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Therefore, we mainly focused on homozygous SNPs for benchmarking, unless explicitly stated in certain parts.</p><p id="Par17">We used STAR, which was recommended in the GATK pipeline, to align reads from scRNA-seq data. Then, we used the seven variant detection tools to identify SNVs without filtering SNPs and calculated the true-positive rates (TPRs) as proportions of detected variants among the number of benchmark bulk SNPs with a minimal depth. We found that the TPRs were highly dependent on the minimal read depths. The overall sensitivity in median was below 8%; however, SAMtools, FreeBayes, Strelka2, CTAT, and GATK detected more than 95% SNPs in median when read depths were &#x0003e;&#x02009;2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). For most of the tools, the TPRs could reach plateaus with more than two reads, but VarScan2 needed more reads to generate confident results. In general, SAMtools showed the highest sensitivity while MuTect2 and VarScan2 showed lower sensitivity (median values of 82.6% and 63.4%, respectively, with &#x0003e;&#x02009;2 reads). When restricting to high-confident coding regions, the TPRs were generally higher, but when read depths were increased, they became close to TPRs in whole genome (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1a). This suggests that sensitivity was associated with genomic contexts, partly attributed to different coverages. Moreover, most variant detection tools could achieve high sensitivity in scRNA-seq data with sufficient read depths.

Notably, the relative orders of TPRs for different tools were similar as those based on homozygous SNPs (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1b).</p><p id="Par19">Synthetic spike-in sequences, which are designed as a standard set of exogenous RNA controls by External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC), were added into our single-cell libraries before the reverse transcription, and thus, the resulting ERCC variants could serve as negative controls. Our results showed that most of the variant-calling tools, except for MuTect2, identified a median level of less than 0.055% noise variants in the ERCC negative control sequences (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Notably, VarScan2 identified the fewest ERCC variants, which was expected considering its low sensitivity. Importantly, the averaged read depths of ERCC are much higher than those of RNA reads, which could lead to potential biases when extending the ERCC-based conclusions to real reads (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1c).</p><p id="Par20">Sequence alignment is an important step in processing short-read data, and unsuitable alignment could dampen the reliable detection of variations. There are several different aligners developed for effective alignment of sequencing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], but their performances vary. It is therefore important to assess the capability of individual aligner in terms of performance and accuracy. To compare the impact of aligners on SNV detection, we evaluated STAR and GSNAP, which are commonly used for scRNA-seq data and reported to be reliable general-purpose aligners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We found that the overall TPRs were higher for STAR than GSNAP, especially with low read depths (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, d, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1d). When reaching plateaus with sufficient read depths, the TPRs for STAR and GSNAP became close. Accordingly, fewer ERCC variants were identified with the GSNAP aligner compared with those identified with the STAR aligner for each variant caller (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b).</p><p id="Par21">To make a fair comparison for different tools, we further investigated how the performances of the methods varied based on their key parameters (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). For MuTect2, we adjusted the key parameters of log-odds (LOD) threshold (&#x003b8;<sub>T</sub>) and found that both the sensitivities and the false discovery rates (FDRs) would decrease with higher LOD thresholds. In addition, when the thresholds were reduced to 0, the performance became worse than those with default settings (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2a, b). For the GATK Best Practices Pipeline, the FDRs would change according to the LOD thresholds, while the sensitivities would not be influenced as much (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2c, d). We have also adjusted the parameters of VarScan2 and found that both the sensitivities and the FDRs would increase with the adjusted parameters (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2e, f). Generally, we observed the precision-recall trade-offs. In brief, adjusting parameters were important for SNV-calling tools to achieve best performance, and users should choose the most suitable parameters according to the preference of sensitivities or specificities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Evaluation based on simulated data in high-confidence regions</title><p id="Par22">Simulation is a compelling approach for benchmarking analysis, as the ground truth is known from the process of generating the data, which enables the evaluation of properties of different methods. We thus randomly introduced 50,000 SNVs into the high-confident protein-coding regions of the hg19 reference genome, which represents an ideal genome context, and then compared the called variants of different tools with the expected SNVs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The TPRs were calculated as proportions of detections among all expected loci, and the FDRs were defined as proportions of false positives among all detected variants. We recapitulated our results in real datasets that the sensitivity was greatly impacted by read depths and became stable when the minimal read depths were larger than 2, except for VarScan2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Specifically, the median sensitivities for SAMtools, FreeBayes, and Strelka2 reached &#x0003e;&#x02009;99% with no less than 10 supporting reads, and most tools reached &#x0003e;&#x02009;92% except for MuTect2. As for the FDRs, the median values were &#x02264;&#x02009;0.2% for all tools except for MuTect2, which exhibited a maximal FDR of 2.4% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). VarScan2 had the highest specificity, followed by Strelka2 and FreeBayes. The GATK-based tool, CTAT, dramatically improved the specificity with no loss of sensitivity compared with GATK.

We used RSEM and genome reference with spike-in mutations to generate simulated scRNA-seq data with known SNVs, and then compared the spike-in mutations and called variants using the hg19 genome reference (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e). We found that the performances of variant callers were highly correlated to those from the first simulation method (Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.98 for TPRs and 0.89 for FDRs). The TPRs were quite similar while the FDRs were considerably higher, especially for SAMtools with low read depths (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f, g). To investigate the cause of the elevated FDRs, we applied the filter of quality&#x0003e;&#x02009;20 for SAMtools and found that the FDRs were significantly reduced with similar TPRs. Therefore, low sequencing quality largely influenced the specificity of SAMtools, especially with low read depths. The filter procedure is therefore highly recommended when with low base qualities. Since the first simulation method used real sequencing data, which represent the real distribution of base quality, we applied the first simulation method in the subsequent sections.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Assessment of the impact of genomic contexts on calling performance</title><p id="Par24">The genomic contexts could have a great impact on SNV detection for DNA sequencing, as reported by Krusche et al.

SNVs could be stably propagated to daughter cells but absent in distantly related cells and thus could serve as intrinsic cellular identifiers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Although scWGS or scWES could be utilized to detect SNVs, such de novo sequencing at single-cell level could be prohibitively expensive and have substantial error rates related to amplification methods, which might hamper the deciphering of cellular dynamics at large scale. Recently, with the innovations of scRNA-seq technology, single-cell transcriptome data have seen explosive growth, forming the potential rich resources for cellular dynamics exploration. Although scRNA-seq has been widely used to characterize the heterogeneity of cell populations, merely measuring gene expression is not enough to evaluate the heterogeneity and lineage relationship of diverse cell types. While gene expression profiling could be subjected to confounding factors and biases that derived from batch effects, cell capture efficiencies, and experimental protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], genetic alterations are associated with such biases in a different manner. Indeed, several studies have explored SNVs in scRNA-seq data to decipher the heterogeneity of cell populations and to track cell lineages retrospectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Nevertheless, the reliability of such analyses needs to be further evaluated, due to the utility of SNVs detecting tools with different performances, most of which are developed for bulk sequencing data.</p><p id="Par33">Here, we systematically analyzed and compared seven SNV-calling methods on scRNA-seq data. We found that the detection performances of these tools highly depend on the read depths, genomic contexts, functional regions, and variant allele frequencies. When using SMART-seq2, the median sensitivities are above 90% for most tools for homozygous SNVs in high-confidence exons with sufficient read depths (more than 10). However, the sensitivities would decrease when detecting SNVs in regions with high GC content, high identity, or low mappability for all analyzed tools. In addition, low supporting reads and low variant ratios could also reduce the sensitivities. Low read depths could be a result of biologically low expressions or technical bias like dropout events from scRNA-seq. Our results suggest that the improvement of sequencing methods to eliminate dropout events may greatly improve the variant detection effect. The FDRs were generally low (&#x0003c;&#x02009;1%), which were less impacted by read depths or VAFs compared with sensitivity. Notably, SAMtools, FreeBayes, and Strelka2 achieved the best performance in most situations, among which SAMtools exhibited higher sensitivity but lower specificity, especially when detecting SNVs located in high-identity regions or introns. FreeBayes showed high sensitivities with high VAFs, while the sensitivities decreased with low VAFs, and the specificities were not stable among different datasets. Strelka2 showed stable TPRs and FDRs in different genomic regions and different datasets, while its sensitivities with low read depths were inferior to SAMtools and FreeBayes. In contrast, MuTect2 did not perform well in most cases, which might be because of the lack of matched normal samples. VarScan2 showed the highest specificities, but it needed more supporting reads to generate confident results. Overall, our results highlight the importance of stratification, for example, by genomic contexts or functional regions, in variant calling for scRNA-seq data, which should be noticed in future benchmarking studies and variant-calling applications.</p><p id="Par34">As for the usability, SAMtools, CTAT, and Strelka2 have advantages. CTAT harbors a built-in aligner and thus has the ability to handle unmapped FASTQ files. Moreover, the alternative parameters enable the flexible usage of CTAT. Besides its superior performances across different genomic regions in our analysis, SAMtools provides clear usage instructions and is user-friendly. In contrast, although pre-processing procedures like sorting and duplicate marking are recommended by FreeBayes, these procedures are not built in the software, thus increasing the difficulty to use. Considering both the performance and usability, we summarize a guideline for the choices of suitable SNV detection tools in different situations when calling variants from scRNA-seq data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). This could serve as a useful reference and shed light on the direction to improving SNV calling in the future.

STAR showed higher sensitivities than GSNAP. More aligners need to be compared further to achieve better performance of variant calling. We showed that parameter adjustment as well as post-filtering could impact the sensitivity or accuracy of variant detection. Detailed comparison of parameter adjustment or post-filtering procedures will further provide insights into the performances of different variant callers in scRNA-seq data. It should also be noticed that the FDR estimations from simulations do not include possible errors introduced during reverse transcription or PCR, although the percentages of variants called in the ERCC spike-in sequences took them into account. Moreover, we performed one-sample analysis to identify SNVs. In this case, we obtained similar results in identifying germline SNPs or somatic SNVs and thus gave same recommendations. However, it could be a different story for analysis with match normal samples and the differences of identifying germline SNPs or somatic SNVs should be noted.</p><p id="Par36">The main limitation of SNV-calling methods in scRNA-seq is the low sensitivity when detecting variants with low read depths or variants with low VAFs in introns or other specific genome contexts. This is especially true for 10x Genomics data. Although identifying SNVs using 10X data could not profile the global landscape of variants, it could still be useful in certain conditions such as lineage tracing. Our analyses showed that there is still room for improvement of the SNV detection from scRNA-seq. On the one hand, the sensitivities are in urgent need to be enhanced; on the other hand, the specificities should be ensured. Due to the great importance of calling SNVs from scRNA-seq data, methods with better performance warrant further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par37">Based on a comprehensive benchmark for the applications of seven variant detection tools in scRNA-seq data, we recommend SAMtools, FreeBayes, Strelka2, or CTAT in different conditions to optimally detect SNVs in scRNA-seq data with low read depths, with high variant allele frequencies, and with sufficient supporting reads, or to process FASTQ files, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).
