However, <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> has proven difficult to engineer to expand the carbon sources it can utilize, the products it can make, and the harsh conditions it can tolerate in industrial applications. Other yeasts that could solve many of these problems remain difficult to manipulate genetically. Here, we engineered the thermotolerant yeast <named-content content-type="genus-species">Kluyveromyces marxianus</named-content> to create a new synthetic biology platform. Using CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats with Cas9)-mediated genome editing, we show that wild isolates of <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content> can be made heterothallic for sexual crossing. By breeding two of these mating-type engineered <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content> strains, we combined three complex traits&#x02014;thermotolerance, lipid production, and facile transformation with exogenous DNA&#x02014;into a single host.

The yeast <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> has served as the major eukaryotic organism for synthetic biology, but lacks the metabolic potential that could be exploited in many of the more than one thousand yeast species that have been identified to date. These yeasts remain difficult to use, however, as there are few synthetic biology tools to access their underlying metabolic networks and physiology (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The budding yeast <named-content content-type="genus-species">Kluyveromyces marxianus</named-content> possesses a number of beneficial traits that make it a promising alternative to <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content>. <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content> is the fastest-growing eukaryotic organism known (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), is thermotolerant, growing and fermenting at temperatures up to 52 and 45&#x000b0;C, respectively (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), and uses a broad range of carbon sources, including pentose sugars. These traits are polygenic and would be difficult to engineer into a less robust host such as <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content>. <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content> also harbors high strain-to-strain physiological and metabolic diversity, which could prove advantageous for combining beneficial traits by sexual crossing. However, <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content> is generally found to be homothallic (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) (i.e., is self-fertile) and cannot be crossed in a controlled manner.</p><p>For <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content> to be useful as a yeast platform for synthetic biology, it will be essential to establish efficient gene editing tools along with methods to cross strains with stable ploidy. These tools would enable rapid strain development, by generating genetic diversity and facilitating stacking of industrially important traits. The CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats with Cas9) gene editing system has been used in many yeasts, including <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Schizosaccharomyces pombe</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Yarrowia lipolytica</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Kluyveromyces lactis</named-content>, and recently <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Genome editing in <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content> should allow manipulation of known genetic targets. However, most desired traits likely depend on multiple, unlinked genetic loci, which remain difficult to identify without the ability to carry out genetic crosses. The ability to cross phenotypically diverse <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> strains has been an indispensable tool for exploring its biology on a genome-wide scale and for improving its use as an industrial host (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). To approach the versatility of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> genetics, it will be necessary to gain full control over <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content> ploidy and mating type. As a homothallic yeast, <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content> lacks a permanent mating type, because <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content> haploid cells naturally change their mating type (either the <bold>a</bold> mating type, <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold>, or &#x003b1; mating type, <italic>MAT</italic>&#x003b1;) leading to uncontrolled <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold>/<italic>MAT</italic>&#x003b1; diploidization within a population (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This stochastic ploidy makes it impossible to carry out quantitative biological studies of interesting traits that are ploidy specific (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), as it leads to populations with mixed phenotypes and prevents <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content> domestication through selective crossing.</p><p>To overcome the limitations in using <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content> as a synthetic biology platform, we adapted the CRISPR-Cas9 system we developed for <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) for use in <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content>, enabling both nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR)-based genome editing. We identified the genetic loci responsible for mating-type switching in <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content> and created domesticated laboratory strains by simultaneously inactivating these genes. With this platform in place, we explored a large collection of wild <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content> strains to investigate <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content> lipid production at high temperatures. By domesticating and crossing promising strains, we were able to combine three complex traits&#x02014;the ability to take up exogenous DNA (transformability), thermotolerance, and higher lipid production&#x02014;into single <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content> isolates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>CRISPR-Cas9 system in <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content>.</title><p>We established robust genome editing in <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content> by adapting the plasmid-based CRISPR-Cas9 (CRISPRm) system we previously developed for <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). We first identified a <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content>-specific origin of replication and <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content>-specific promoters and terminators for expressing Cas9 (see Materials and Methods). We used the <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> gene for tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> as an RNA polymerase III promoter to express single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) from the same plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>). To test the effectiveness of the redesigned CRISPR-Cas9 system, we used a wild strain we isolated from a sugarcane bagasse pile (Km1 [<xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>]), and a Km1-derived <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> heterothallic strain (Km30 [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table&#x000a0;S1</xref> in the supplemental material]).

Alternative methods for creating stable haploids by deleting the silenced <italic>MAT</italic> loci have been used in yeast (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), but this strategy creates sterile strains and can be lethal if the endonuclease that initiates the double-strand break required for mating-type switching is not inactivated as well (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Our strategy of inactivating both the &#x003b1;3 and Kat1 transposases preserves the ability to mate <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content> strains, an essential tool for synthetic biology, and to take advantage of this yeast&#x02019;s remarkable phenotypic diversity. We successfully isolated heterothallic haploid strains from 12 wild-type isolates. These strains readily mate with each other, resulting in sporulation-competent diploids that segregate to viable haploid spores. Combined with CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), these results establish a full set of tools for use of <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content> as a synthetic biology host and for future exploration of its biology on a genome-wide scale.</p><p>Using both sets of synthetic biology tools described here, we sought to exploit the diversity of <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content> as a thermotolerant, fast-growing, Crabtree-negative yeast. Screening 11 of the wild-type isolates for high levels of lipogenesis, we found high strain-to-strain variability in lipid production. Notably, strain Km19 produced &#x0223c;10% lipid by dry cell weight after 24 h at 42&#x000b0;C, a considerably shorter time than the 120 h required by wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species">Y. lipolytica</named-content> to accumulate a similar amount of lipid (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). We find Km19 stores the vast majority of lipid as free fatty acids (FFAs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3C</xref>), in contrast to <named-content content-type="genus-species">Y. lipolytica</named-content>, which stores lipids as triacylglycerols (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). FFAs are particularly suitable for the production of alkanes/alkenes and fatty alcohols, two types of high-value chemicals (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Although Km19 produces lipids at a high rate, it is not thermotolerant compared to other <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content> isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#x000a0;5C</xref>) and is difficult to transform with plasmid DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref>). To eliminate these barriers to conducting genetic engineering in the oleaginous strain Km19, we crossed it with Km17, which transforms well and grows well at 45&#x000b0;C. Notably, some progeny of this cross isolated as single segregants produced lipids to the same level of the parent Km19 strain while retaining thermotolerance and transformability of Km17 and were also not prone to aggregation. The power of combining multiple complex and valuable traits using stable heterothallic strains, together with CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering, opens a new frontier to use <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content> as both a thermotolerant model species and an industrially relevant host.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Strains, media, and culture conditions.</title><p>The <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. marxianus</named-content> strains used in this study were purchased from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection) or CBS (The Dutch Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures, Fungal Biodiversity Centre) or were obtained from an in-house collection.
