Characterization of these mutations and exploration of their clinical relevance constitute a critical part of personalized medicine. Mutations present in multiple forms and common ones include single nucleotide variants (SNVs), short insertions/deletions (indels), or fusion transcripts. SNVs or indels are primarily detected from DNA sequencing such as whole-genome, exome-sequencing, targeted sequence or amplicon. However, RNA-seq is the most popular sequencing application as it contains much richer genomic information. Not only does it measure gene expression but it also can detect important structural variants such as SNVs, indels or fusion transcripts, some of which are known actionable mutations for tumor treatment. A good example of this is EGFR single base mutation (L858R) in exon 21 and in-frame deletions (ranging from 12 to 18 bases) in exon 19, both can be targeted by EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as gefitinib and erlotinib with clear clinical benefits to patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although fusion transcript detection from RNA-seq is commonly used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], use of RNA-seq for SNV or Indel mutation detection in clinical settings is still rare, which is contributed by several reasons. Detection of structural variants from RNA-seq is much more challenging. RNA transcripts are spliced molecules from different parts of genome and exon-exon junction aware alignment is needed. This alignment causes difficulty for variant calling tools, which are mostly developed for DNA-sequencing. As the primary goal of RNA-seq is gene expression profiling, commonly used RNA-seq mapping programs often conduct ungapped mapping and sequence reads with insertion or deletion are un-mappable and these variants would be ignored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Even for the same alignment, variant calling tools perform differently, particularly for Indel detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Another concern for RNA-seq based mutation detection is differential gene expression, which leads to variable coverage between genes and affects variant detection for genes expressed at low level. This is highly relevant and important for mutation discovery. Meanwhile, data also show that key or driver mutations often occur in expressed genes and tend to be conserved and easily detectable in RNA-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which makes RNA-seq based mutation detection a potential cost effective alternative if it can be used for multiple information profiling simultaneously.</p><p id="Par12">Many RNA-seq workflows have been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], but they mostly perform a particular function in research settings. MAP-RSeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] is a comprehensive analytical pipeline with gene expression quantification, fusion transcript and SNV detection, but it cannot detect indels. PRADA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] focuses fusion detection and annotation. A recent tool Opossum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] conducts comprehensive RNA-seq alignment pre-processing before variant calling by either Platypus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] or GATK Haplotype Caller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] but only SNVs are evaluated. As continuation of our previous work in detecting Indels from RNA-seq, we have developed an integrated RNA-seq pipeline &#x0201c;PanMutsRx&#x0201d; with goal of reporting common and clinical important mutations (SNVs, indels, fusion transcript) at once. PanMutsRx implements RNA-seq alignment programs that conduct gapped and junction aware mapping, performs rigourous pre-processing steps unique to RNA-seq before variant calling, incorporates selected best performing single sample variant and paired somatic mutation callers, and optionally reports mutations for a list of genes in interest. Using a sample from Genome in a Bottle Consortium where variants are well defined from multi-platform DNA-sequencing, we demonstrated its good performance in SNV and Indel detection. We also tested a set of clinical samples with known mutations and fusion transcripts and showed that important mutations were almost all detectable, which makes it a potential application for clinical applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Pipeline implementation</title><p id="Par13">PanMutsRx is implemented modularly using Python 3 and shell scripts for various operations such as input/output file operations, log file management, submitting jobs to cluster (optional), tool execution and integration.

STAR is an ultrafast RNA-Seq junction aware aligner which uses sequential maximum mappable seed search, seed clustering and stitching. A two-step alignment is implemented to increase the accuracy; in the first step splice junctions are detected and are used to guide in the second alignment. STAR is not only superfast but also very sensitive for Indel detection as demonstrated in our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. GSNAP is another junction aware and fast aligner which is tolerant to complex genomic events like variants and indels and was shown more sensitive for longer indels when sequence reads are short [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].

For the same sample, RNA-seq was performed through ENCODE project. We downloaded the raw RNA-seq data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.encodeproject.org/">https://www.encodeproject.org/</ext-link>; ENCFF377UIC with 147 million pair-end reads at 100&#x000a0;bp read length) and analyzed through our pipeline for SNVs and Indels and compared with the benchmark DNA variants. As variants from RNA-seq are only possible from coding regions and only expressed genes can be assessed, the comparison was limited to the genomic positions with at least 10X coverage in the RNA-seq where variants are reported in the reference dataset from GIAB. The sensitivity was calculated as the percent of correct calls in RNA-seq at these positions in comparison with variants in DNAs (SNVs or indels separately). For specificity, we extracted all positions in RNA-seq with at least 10X coverage but there are no variants in DNA as defined in GIAB benchmark set (true negatives or TN). Any variants in these positions reported from RNA-seq were considered as false positives (FP) and the specificity was obtained by the formula: TN/(TN&#x02009;+&#x02009;FP).</p><p id="Par24">We also run sample ENCFF377UIC by other public tools and compared the relative performances for the SNV and Indel detection. Opossum is a RNA-seq preprocessing tool before variant calling by either Platypus or GATK haplotype caller and demonstrates a good performance in SNV detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition to the GATK best practices for RNA-seq variant calling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], which PanMutRx follows, Opossum merges overlapping reads and modifies the base qualities at the ends of these reads before splitting them. Opossum can use Tophat or STAR alignment but we used the latter as the former does not allow Indel detection. RVBoost along with MAP-RSeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] is a RNA variant prioritization method with demonstrated better performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. It uses several attributes unique for RNA-seq and a boosting method to train a model with reliable variants and then prioritizes the RNA SNV variants based on the trained model.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Lung cancer adenocarcinoma RNA-seq datasets with known oncogenic or targetable mutations</title><p id="Par25">Lung cancer is one of tumors harboring a high number of mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and some of the mutations are sensitive to targeted therapy such as EGFR single nucleotide mutation at exon 21 (L858R) and intermediate indels (12 to 18 bases) at exon 19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and EML4-ALK fusion targeted by kinase inhibitor Crizotinib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

In real practice, the filter stringency can be adjusted to balance the sensitivity and specificity.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Fusion detection at different concentration of spike-ins known fusion transcripts.

PanMutsRx generates two expression matrix files, raw digital read count and normalized expression by RPKM. The former can be used for differential expression by read count specific tools such as DESeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] or edgeR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and the latter can be used for linear model or comparing relative expression across genes. As an illustration, in the lung adenocarcinoma dataset, we also found a tumor with EML4-ALK fusion. Examining the expression of ALK across all tumors samples revealed that tumor had significantly higher expression of ALK (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>), further validating the fusion led to the activation of ALK and was a potential candidate for targeted therapy by a protein kinase inhibitor such as Crizotinib. Another potential application from gene expression data is to estimate immune cell proportion in a tumor. Cybersort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] is a tool using gene expression data to characterize cell composition of complex tissues. Based on a pre-built immune cell signature, it can be used to estimate the immune cell infiltration to a tumor that may provide useful information for an immune response status (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Application examples of gene expression data. <bold>a</bold> Outlier ALK expression as a result of EMLK4-ALK fusion in a tumor. <bold>b</bold> Estimation of immune cell relative proportions in the lung adenocarcinoma by Cibersort.

Besides research, it also holds great promise for clinical diagnostics, prognostics and therapeutic applicability for various diseases, particularly cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. To put this into practice, various bioinformatics analyses challenges need to be overcome and to compile the types of information that can be reliably utilized for clinical applications from RNA-seq. Obviously, differential expression, alternative splicing, or allele specific expression are only unique to RNA-seq. RNA-seq is also an excellent platform for fusion transcript detection. The challenges are in detection of single nucleotide variants or small Indels from RNA-seq. Our previous evaluation shows that although SNVs can be reliably detected, indels are ignored by common RNA-seq tools, which calls for a need to develop a more sensitive pipeline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. PanMutsRx is developed to meet this specific and critical need.</p><p id="Par34">PanMutsRx was designed with the goal of easy usage and detection of multiple types of mutations simultaneously. Our assessment showed its high sensitivity and specificity to SNVs and small Indels. Fusion transcripts can be easily detected and gene expression can be used along for cross validation of fusion transcript or other applications. In real practice of oncology, only very limited number of mutations has available drugs and capturing these mutations is of paramount priority. Our previous and current work suggests that although many unique mutations can be detected from either DNA-seq (like exome-seq) or RNA-seq, the important and actionable mutations are often conserved in RNA-seq. This suggests we can extract useful and relevant information to reduce the complexity of multi-genomic information from RNA-seq. We provide a post-processing script to extract SNVs, Indels, fusion transcripts, or expression for a list of genes users provide.</p><p id="Par35">Available RNA-seq workflows mostly focus a particular function for example, gene expression, SNV or fusion transcript detection, which has its advantages of easy management. However, conducting analysis for each separately needs redundant work with significant effort for the RNA-seq data. PanMutsRx aimed to perform all clinical relevant tasks at once by selecting high performing tools for each application. RNA-seq alignment by different aligners makes much less difference for SNVs than for Indels and our selection of STAR and GSNAP as part of PanMutsRx was based on our comprehensive comparison among several tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Our current data further validated their good performance. For STAR alignment, it appears that PanMutsRx pre-processing generated very similar result as Opossum pre-processing. Results from GATK Haplotype caller were more sensitive than Platypus for both SNVs and Indels under the default settings. Parameter optimization may be needed to achieve better results. The slight gain from Opossum in some occasions may justify its adoption. As PanMutsRx is highly modular, a better tool can be integrated easily.</p><p id="Par36">The missed calls in RNA-seq can be several reasons. We found majority of them were caused by insufficient alternative allele and although could be called but filtered out. These positions can be recovered by reducing filtering stringency but the trade-off would be increased false positives. Although Indel detection performs reasonably well, there is room for further improvement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par37">We have developed a sensitive and comprehensive RNA-seq analytical pipeline which can capture multiple mutations simultaneously (single nucleotide, small insertion/deletion, chimeric transcripts or abnormal gene expression) and can be potentially used in clinical practice and precision medicine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec16"><p>
