A repertoire of na&#x000ef;ve BCRs are encoded in a large number of B cells, each of which expresses a sequence-wise unique BCR through antibody gene segment recombination and segment junction diversification.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref></sup> However, it has been estimated that more than half of all human BCRs expressed by early immature B cells, where the BCR sequences are the same or closely related to the germline sequences, are polyreactive; the BCR polyreactivity was defined as that the BCR bound to at least two structurally and chemically distinguished antigens, albeit with relatively low affinity compared with affinity-matured antibodies by orders of magnitude in dissociation constant.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>-<xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref></sup> The polyreactivity of the immature BCRs is likely to be a prerequisite condition bridging the gap between the humoral innate immunity and the adaptive immunity, allowing the adaptive immune system to rapidly develop humoral protection by matured antibodies through finite cycles of stochastic somatic hyper mutation (SHM)<sup><xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref></sup> and clonal selection<sup><xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref></sup> of the BCRs. In light of the notion that the na&#x000ef;ve antibody repertoires decoupled from the <italic>in vivo</italic> affinity maturation processes might not be productive sources for highly specific antibodies against diverse antigens, the goal of our study was to address the question of practical importance as to what sequences in the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of antibodies could confer high affinity and specificity on the antibodies against their cognate antigens, with the focus of engineering antibody-antigen interaction hot spot residues in the CDRs.</p><p>Antibodies provide immune protections by recognizing antigens with remarkable affinity and exquisite specificity, in large part through key antibody-antigen interface residues known as hot spot residues to reflect their binding energetics contributions. Surveys of general protein-protein interactions (PPIs) indicate that the hot spot residues in the interfaces contribute substantially to the energetics of the PPIs.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>-<xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref></sup> Antibodies recognize antigens with sub-nanomolar affinity through the aromatic residue-enriched CDRs,<sup><xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref>-<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref></sup> which are populated with hot spot residues that contribute substantially to the antibody-antigen interaction energy.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>-<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref></sup></p><p>Study of the functionalities of the hot spot residues of antibodies in nature have helped establish an understanding of antibody-protein recognitions,<sup><xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref></sup> but methods to engineer CDR hot spot residues to enhance antibody-antigen recognitions have not been established. It is not known if the engineered CDR hot spot residues are functionally sustainable in the antibody structure frameworks, and if more densely populated CDR hot spot residues above the hot spot residue distribution level in antibodies in nature could be accompanied by enhanced functionalities for the engineered antibodies to recognize antigens. Moreover, identifying hot spot residues on a vast number of antibodies is intractable with experimental methods. An alternative method feasible for large-scale hot spot residue evaluations is thus indispensable for designing and engineering hot spot residues on antibodies.</p><p>To address these questions, we constructed phage-displayed synthetic antibody libraries with single-chain variable fragment (scFv) variants encoded with densely enhanced CDR hot spot residues and tested the functionalities of these synthetic antibody libraries against protein antigens. The synthetic antibody scFv libraries were constructed with oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis;<sup><xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>-<xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref></sup> the enriched antigen-recognition determinants on the scFv variants were calculated with the ISMBLab package, which is a collection of machine learning predictors for quantitative antigen-recognition propensities on the antigen binding sites of the antibodies.<sup><xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref>-<xref rid="CIT0029">29</xref></sup> The antigen-recognition propensity computation indicated that the scFv variants of the designed synthetic antibody libraries were encoded with multiple folds of CDR hot spot residues with high protein antigen recognition propensities compared with those of the human antibody germline sequences. Selected anti-protein antibodies from the synthetic antibody libraries were highly specific against the corresponding protein antigens with sub-nanomolar affinity without <italic>in vivo</italic> affinity maturation, indicating that the antibodies encoded with enhanced population of CDR hot spot residues could bind to protein antigens with high specificity and affinity, bypassing the <italic>in vivo</italic> affinity maturation processes involving somatic hyper mutations and clonal selections.</p><p>As antibodies are becoming the most prominent class of protein therapeutics,<sup><xref rid="CIT0030">30</xref></sup> better understanding of the principles governing antibody affinity and specificity will facilitate in understanding humoral immunity and in developing novel antibody-based therapeutics. Computational and experimental results indicate that the antibody CDR sequences alternative to human germline sequences can be rationally directed to recognize antigens with high specificity and affinity. Molecular understanding of antibody specificity and affinity could lead to antibodies with optimal characteristics pertinent to their medical applications.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Results</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>Synthetic antibody library constructs based on the prominent canonical CDR structures in the antibodies with known structure in protein data bank</title><p>We designed and constructed three sets of antibody libraries based on the CDR sequence length configurations of the most prominent antibody structures found in the antibodies with known structure in Protein Data Bank (PDB). Antibody variable domain fragment structures archived in PDB mostly bind to four classes of antigen: protein, peptide, carbohydrate, or small molecule/hapten. By removing redundant antibody structures with pairwise sequence identity above 95% and other criteria (Supplementary Methods), we attained four antibody-antigen complex structure datasets (Figure S1 A): Ab-PRO (281 antibody-protein complex structures), Ab-PEP (111 antibody-peptide complex structures), Ab-CARB (14 antibody-carbohydrate complex structures), and Ab-LIG (106 antibody-hapten complex structures).</p><p>The CDR H1-H2-L1-L2-L3 length configuration 13&#x02013;10-11&#x02013;8-9 (the definition of the CDRs follows the work by North et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0031">31</xref></sup>) with the canonical structure configuration 1&#x02013;2-2&#x02013;1-1 as defined by Chothia and coworkers<sup><xref rid="CIT0032">32</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0033">33</xref></sup> is the most prominent antibody structure class in these antibody-antigen complex structures (Figure S1 B ~&#x000a0;E), as well as in human antibody repertoires and known antibody sequence databases (Figure S2 A ~&#x000a0;C). The peak of the CDR-H3 length distribution of these 13&#x02013;10-11&#x02013;8-9 antibodies of known structure is centered at 12&#x000a0;~&#x000a0;13 residues (Figure S2 D).</p><p>In addition to the 13&#x02013;10-11&#x02013;8-9 antibodies, the CDR length configuration 13&#x02013;10-16&#x02013;8-9 with the main canonical structure configuration 1&#x02013;2-4&#x02013;1-1 as defined by Chothia<sup><xref rid="CIT0032">32</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0033">33</xref></sup> is found most frequently in the antibody-peptide (Ab-PEP), antibody-carbohydrate (Ab-CARB), and antibody-hapten (Ab-LIG) complexes (Figure S1 A, C ~&#x000a0;E). Longer CDR-H3s (&#x0003e;&#x000a0;17 residues) do not seem compatible with this class of antibodies (Figure S2 D).</p><p>Based on these prominent antibody structure classes, three sets of synthetic antibody libraries with increasing structural complexity were designed and constructed: set(1) GH2-13 (one antibody library): 13&#x02013;10-11&#x02013;8-9 antibodies with 13-residue CDR-H3s (CDR sequence designs shown in Tables S1 and S2); set(2) GH2-6&#x000a0;~&#x000a0;20 (11 antibody libraries): 13&#x02013;10-11&#x02013;8-9 antibodies with 6&#x000a0;~&#x000a0;20-residue CDR-H3s, excluding 13-residue CDR-H3s (CDR sequence designs shown in Tables S1 and S3); set(3) GH3-6&#x000a0;~&#x000a0;13 (8 libraries): 13&#x02013;10-16&#x02013;8-9 and 13&#x02013;10-17&#x02013;8-9 antibodies with 6&#x000a0;~&#x000a0;13-residue CDR-H3s (CDR sequence designs shown in Tables S4 and S5). The CDRs of the scFv variants in the synthetic antibody libraries were designed to encode densely enhanced CDR hot spot residues, as analyzed in a later section (see the section: <italic>Hot spot residues are substantially more densely distributed in the CDRs of the synthetic antibody library scFv variants</italic>). One key feature of these synthetic antibody libraries is that each of the libraries contains only one or two CDR H1-H2-L1-L2-L3 length configurations with fixed CDR-H3 length, such that the functional contributions from the CDR lengths can be elucidated respectively.</p><p>These 20 synthetic antibody libraries were constructed and expressed as phage-displayed scFv libraries based on the framework of the VL/VH combination IGKV1-NL1/IGHV3-23 with the well-established method previously published<sup><xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0021">21</xref></sup> (see Methods and Supplementary Methods). The phage-displayed synthetic antibody library construction procedure has been validated with next-generation sequencing (NGS).<sup><xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref></sup> Each of the synthetic scFv libraries contained at least 10<sup>9</sup> well-folded scFv variants (Protein A/L binding to the IGKV1-NL1/IGHV3-23 framework as indication for the structural stability of the scFv variants<sup><xref rid="CIT0022">22</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0023">23</xref></sup>) with sequence diversified in all the 6 CDRs (Tables S1~&#x000a0;S5).</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2002"><title>Experimental validations of the phage-displayed synthetic antibody libraries</title><p>The phage-displayed synthetic antibody libraries were first experimentally validated with scFvs isolated from the antibody libraries binding to 22 randomly selected protein antigens (Table S6). After this first general test of the synthetic antibody libraries, we further tested the synthetic antibody libraries on one antigen (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 extracellular domain (HER2-ECD)) with more comprehensive analyses of the scFv variants and the IgGs reformatted from the selected scFv candidates, as described in a later section (see the section: <italic>Antibodies from the synthetic antibody libraries bind to HER2-ECD through diverse epitopes with high affinity and specificity without affinity maturation</italic>). The experimental procedures for the biopanning of the phage-displayed scFv libraries against protein antigens and the binding evaluation of the isolated soluble scFv molecules to the corresponding antigen have been standardized and published previously<sup><xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0021">21</xref></sup> (Supplementary Methods). To evaluate the general functionalities of the synthetic antibody libraries, we carried out the standard biopanning with the synthetic antibody libraries against randomly selected protein antigens and evaluated the binding of the resultant scFvs against the protein antigens. We did not enumerate all 20(libraries)&#x000d7;&#x000a0;22(antigens) possible library-antigen biopannings; rather, we carried out 118 randomly selected antibody discovery campaigns. Only 13 of 118 biopannings failed to generate any positive binders; 105 of 118 antibody discovery campaigns yielded positive scFv binders against the corresponding protein antigen with stable native scFv structure. The number of non-redundant scFv binders and the number of positive clones sequenced are shown for each of the antibody discovery campaigns in Table S6. The increases of the binding affinities of the polyclonal soluble scFvs of the output phage libraries from each round of the biopannings are also shown for each of the antibody discovery campaigns in Figure S3. Overall, as shown in Table S6, scFv binders from each of the synthetic antibody libraries were attained from the standard biopanning against at least one randomly selected protein antigens, and binding scFvs against each of the protein antigens were attainable from at least one randomly selected synthetic antibody library. Moreover, 18 of the 20 antibody libraries tested were proven to contain specific scFv binders against more than one randomly selected protein antigens; one antibody library (GH2-13) was tested on 20 randomly selected protein antigens and only one antigen failed to generate a specific scFv binder (Table S6). These experimental validations, in terms of generating multiple and specific scFv binders with stable native scFv structure against the corresponding randomly selected antigens, suggested that each of the GH synthetic antibody libraries contains well-folded scFv variants binding to randomly selected protein antigens in general.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2003"><title>Hot spot residues are substantially more densely distributed in the CDRs of the synthetic antibody library ScFV variants</title><p>In order to compare the hot spot residue distributions on antibodies in nature versus those on the antibodies from the synthetic antibody libraries, we predicted hot spot residues on the scFv structures with the machine learning methods that we have previously developed for predicting the PPI propensities of protein surface atoms<sup><xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref></sup> (ISMBLab-PPI, see Methods and Supplementary Methods). A query scFv structure derived experimentally or computationally is the only required input for the prediction of the atomistic interaction propensities of the query antibody surface atoms to be involved in a combination site for a protein antigen. The output of the predictors for each of the query antibody surface atoms is normalized into a prediction confidence level (PCL) ranging from 0 to 1, which represents the atomistic propensity for the query antibody surface atom to interact with a protein antigen. Note that the atomistic propensities were calculated only for protein surface atoms; any solvent-inaccessible atom has zero propensity to interact with the protein antigen. A residue on the query antibody structure with maximal atomistic propensity &#x02265;&#x000a0;0.45 is predicted as a hot spot residue. The predictions are correlated with experimentally determined hot spot residues defined by the threshold of &#x00394;&#x00394;G &#x02265;&#x000a0;1 kcal/mol in alanine-scanning experiments with Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.43 and F1 score of 0.51.<sup><xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref></sup> While the alanine-scanning of hot spot residues is experimentally intractable for the large number of scFv variants from the synthetic antibody libraries and from antibodies in nature, the computational hot spot predictions provide an alternative for evaluating the hot spot residue distributions in the CDRs of the scFvs, albeit with uncertainty in prediction accuracy to an extent.</p><p>Although the CDR sequence length configurations of the synthetic antibody libraries resemble those of the prominent antibody structures (see above), the CDRs of the synthetic antibody libraries are much more densely enriched with hot spot residues than those of the antibodies with known structures in PDB. In Table S6, each scFv library had two sets of scFv sequences collected from the validation experiments described in the previous section: set(F) &#x02013; scFv sequences known to fold properly (Protein A/L binding; numbers of non-redundant sequences as shown in the column labelled ProA/L in Table S6; total 1819 sequences), and set(FB) &#x02013; scFv sequences known to fold and to bind to the corresponding protein antigen (binding to Protein A/L and the corresponding antigens; numbers of non-redundant sequences as shown in the columns labelled by the corresponding antigen names in Table S6; total 1563 sequences). In addition, for each of the scFv libraries, the scFv sequence set(D) contained 200 randomly selected theoretical scFv sequences based on the CDR designs (Tables S1~&#x000a0;S5).

Indeed, as expected, the CDR sequence profiles of the scFvs in set(F) and set(FB) show prominent sequence features in the CDR sequence profiles of the scFvs (Figure S4~&#x000a0;S9), especially in the scFvs of set(FB) (Figure S5, S7 and S9) likely due to the requirements of both folding of the scFv and binding of the CDRs to the corresponding protein antigens. The prominent sequence features in the CDR sequence profiles, which reflect the binding and/or folding requirements of the amino acid types at specific sequence positions, are likely to restrict the distributions of the CDR hot spot residues in these sequence positions, explaining the decreasing of the CDR hot spot residues in the scFvs of the set(F) and set(FB).

The distributions of the hot spot residues for both antibody-protein and antibody-peptide interactions are CDR position-dependent, mostly due to the dependence of the amino acid type distribution and the exposure level of the amino acid sidechain on its CDR position. The antibody-protein interaction hot spot residues are more abundant and are distributed in a more extensive surface area than the antibody-peptide interaction hot spot residues, in agreement with the general experimental observation that the peptide binding sites are smaller than the protein binding sites on antibodies. Overall, the amino acid type distributions of the predicted hot spot residues for both antibody-protein and antibody-peptide interactions are more prominent for the residues with aromatic sidechains, in agreement with the hot spot residues in PPIs.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2004"><title>Antibodies from the synthetic antibody libraries bind to HER2-ECD through diverse epitopes with high affinity and specificity without affinity maturation</title><p>To scrutinize the antibody molecules from the synthetic antibody libraries, we focused on the HER2-ECD-binding scFvs from the synthetic antibody libraries to characterize the spectrum of epitopes on HER2-ECD interacting with the scFvs. Fourteen of the 20 synthetic antibody libraries yielded HER2-ECD-binding scFvs (Table S6).

(c) Distributions of the mean &#x0fb02;uorescence intensities (MFI in log<sub>10</sub> scale in the x-axes) for the scFvs (0.5&#x000a0;nM) from each epitope group complexed with AL1-RFP binding to cell surface HER2 on N87 cells measured by flow cytometry are shown with the box plots. Red dash line shows the negative control background intensity. In parallel, the MFI measurements for the same set of scFvs on the HER2-negative MCF-7 cells are also shown for comparison. (d) Distributions of cell viabilities (percentage of survival cells shown in the x-axes) for N87 (upper panels) and MCF-7 (lower panels) cells treated with 0.5&#x000a0;nM scFvs complexed with AL1-PE38KDEL at the 1:1 molar ratio are shown with the box plots.

The scFv variants were cytotoxic to varying extent when non-covalently conjugated with <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> exotoxin AL1-PE38KDEL or AL2-PE38KDEL<sup><xref rid="CIT0034">34</xref></sup> as shown in Figure S15, the data of which are summarized in <xref rid="F0007">Figure 7(d</xref>,<xref rid="F0007">e)</xref>, respectively, in box plots. These cytotoxicity data are shown in parallel with the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) measurements of the RFP (red fluorescence protein)-labeled scFvs binding to HER2-ECD on cell surface (Figure S16). The MFI data sets are summarized in <xref rid="F0007">Figure 7(c</xref>) in box plots. The binding affinities are not correlated with receptor-mediated cytotoxicities of the scFv-PE38 non-covalent immunoconjugates (Figure S16). To validate the specificity of the scFvs binding to HER2-ECD, we compared the cytotoxicity/MFI data from N87 cells known to express HER2 on the cell surface with the corresponding data from MCF-7 cells known to express negligible HER2 on the cell surface as negative control in Figure S16 and <xref rid="F0007">Figure 7(c</xref>,<xref rid="F0007">d</xref>,<xref rid="F0007">e)</xref>. The negative control cytotoxicity/MFI data sets indicate no cross reaction of the 241 HER2-ECD-positive scFvs to the cells without HER2 expression (Figure S16), indicating specific binding of the scFvs to the cell surface HER2-ECD. These results indicate that the scFvs selected and screened from the synthetic antibody libraries binding to recombinant HER2-ECD immobilized in ELISA wells also specifically bound to HER2 on the cell surface.</p><p>Finally, we characterized human IgG1s reformatted from 43 scFvs randomly selected from the 241 HER2-ECD-binding scFvs. The epitope group, CDR sequences, production yield and affinity to HER2-ECD (EC<sub>50</sub>) for each of these IgG1s are summarized in Table S8. The expression and purification of these IgG1s were characterized with SDS-PAGE gels (Figure S17). The scFv variants from the synthetic antibody libraries were anticipated to bind to protein antigens through either conformational or linear epitopes (see above), but the epitopes discovered were nevertheless dominated by conformational ones: 42 of the 43 IgG1s bound to HER2-ECD through conformational epitopes (Figure S18); only one IgG1 (GH12CIC-6, see Table S8 and Figure S18) bound to HER2-ECD through a linear epitope. Although the CDR length configurations 13&#x02013;10-16/17&#x02013;8-9 were rarely found in antibody-protein complexes in PDB (Figure S1B), the antibodies from the synthetic antibody library set GH3-6&#x000a0;~&#x000a0;13 nevertheless bound to the protein antigen HER2-ECD with high affinity through diverse conformational epitopes (Table S8). The affinities of the IgG1s were compared with that of trastuzumab in EC<sub>50</sub> measurements, with the binding versus IgG1 concentration curves presented in Figure S19: 19 (curves plotted in black in Figure S19) of the 43 IgG1s had higher affinity than that of trastuzumab in terms EC<sub>50</sub> measurements on the basis of the statistics of the binding versus IgG1 concentration curves (Figure S19). The high affinity antibodies bound to the antigen through diverse epitopes (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref> and Table S8). These results indicated that selected scFvs from the synthetic antibody libraries herein can be reformatted and expressed as IgG1 with affinity frequently superior to that of the affinity-matured antibodies without explicit affinity maturation processes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S0003"><title>Discussion</title><p>The functionalities of the synthetic scFv libraries are attributed to the enhanced distributions of the CDR hot spot residues in the scFv variants. <italic>In vivo</italic> affinity maturation by stochastic SHM does not occur with specific preference to antibody residues in contact with the antigens,<sup><xref rid="CIT0035">35</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0036">36</xref></sup> and has been known to enhance the antibody-antigen binding through diverse mechanisms, such as by increasing nonpolar complementarity of the antigen-contact areas,<sup><xref rid="CIT0037">37</xref></sup> introducing subtle structural variations between the variable domain interface,<sup><xref rid="CIT0038">38</xref></sup> optimizing electrostatic interactions,<sup><xref rid="CIT0038">38</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0039">39</xref></sup> and reducing antigen-binding site flexibility.<sup><xref rid="CIT0040">40</xref>-<xref rid="CIT0042">42</xref></sup> Alternatively, we found that antibodies with enhanced protein-specific hot spot residue distributions on the CDRs could confer the antibodies with high affinity and specificity to protein antigens without affinity maturation. The rationales are that more hot spot residues in the antibody-protein antigen binding surfaces could enhance more energetically favorable antibody-antigen interactions and that combinations of more densely distributed hot spot residues could result in more diverse and effective antibody-protein recognition surfaces on the antibody CDRs, increasing the probability of forming antigen binding sites with high specificity due to better complementarity to cognate protein antigen&#x02019;s surfaces.<sup><xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref></sup> Experiments herein indicate that the antibody variable domains have substantial structural tolerance for enhanced hot spot density by multiple folds in comparison with those in the human germline antibody variable domain sequences; it seems that germline antibodies are under-equipped with hot spot residues in exchange for keeping options open for polyreactive recognition of diverse antigens. Many functional antibodies, for which the specificity and affinity are comparable or superior to the corresponding control antibody optimized through <italic>in vivo</italic> affinity maturation, can be readily discovered from these artificially designed synthetic scFv libraries with enhanced hot spot residue distributions in the CDRs, suggesting an alternative to the <italic>in vivo</italic> affinity maturation procedure required for progeny antibodies from germline antibody lineages, which do not necessarily satisfy all the characteristics needed in antibody-based therapeutics.</p><p>Phage-displayed synthetic antibody libraries have been developed into technological platforms and successfully applied to antibody discoveries. The human Combinatorial Antibody Libraries (HuCAL) technology of MorphoSys is built on 49 variable domain frameworks, each of which consists of one VH domain from 7 representative human VH consensus sequences and one VL domain from 7 representative human VL consensus sequences.<sup><xref rid="CIT0043">43</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0044">44</xref></sup> Only the CDR3L and CDR3H sequences were diversified according to the knowledge-based designs derived from public domain antibody sequence and structural databases. The first HuCAL scFv library designs had a theoretical sequence space on the order of 10<sup>18</sup> (49&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>7</sup>&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>9</sup>).<sup><xref rid="CIT0044">44</xref></sup> Only around 10<sup>10</sup> HuCAL variants have been expressed as phage-displayed libraries, mainly due to the upper limit in the bacterial host transformation of the phage display technology settings.<sup><xref rid="CIT0044">44</xref></sup> The subsequent HuCAL GOLD technology incorporated knowledge-based designs to diversify all six CDRs in the antibody fragment variable domain,<sup><xref rid="CIT0043">43</xref></sup> and the HuCAL PLATINUM technology improved the 49 framework sequences based on the human antibody germline sequences.<sup><xref rid="CIT0045">45</xref></sup> The magnitudes of the library complexity remain on the order of 10<sup>10</sup> for all libraries of the HuCAL series.<sup><xref rid="CIT0045">45</xref></sup></p><p>Based on the notion that antibody paratopes are enriched with aromatic residues, noticeable upon solving the first structures of antibody-antigen complexes<sup><xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref></sup> and surveys of antibody structures and sequences thereafter,<sup><xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>-<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref></sup> the fundamental role of the tyrosyl side chains in antibody-antigen recognition has been demonstrated<sup><xref rid="CIT0046">46</xref>-<xref rid="CIT0049">49</xref></sup> with the functional antibodies selected and screened from the minimalist designs of antibody CDR libraries with only a small subset of amino acid types (Tyr, Ala, Asp, Ser)<sup><xref rid="CIT0049">49</xref></sup> or with binary code (Tyr and Ser).<sup><xref rid="CIT0048">48</xref></sup> Synthetic antibody libraries based on the observed distributions of amino acid type in antibodies have also been demonstrated to be productive tools in antibody discoveries.<sup><xref rid="CIT0050">50</xref></sup></p><p>The antibody libraries developed in this study are different from the previously developed synthetic antibody libraries in that our antibody libraries have been constructed with antibody-antigen (proteins and peptides) interaction propensity predictions as guidance. We used the computational methodology to assess antibody library designs to ensure that the antibody variants in the synthetic antibody libraries have substantial antibody-antigen interaction propensities, rather than just to imitate antibody sequences in nature or limit to the minimalist designs for antibody library constructions. The experimental tests of the functionalities of the antibody libraries indicated that these antibody library designs can be constructed and expressed with the phage display system, and the selected antibodies are functional both in stability, affinity and specificity to the target antigen comparable to the antibodies derived from natural immune systems. These results suggest that antibody libraries could be designed with specificity guidance by the computational machine learning algorithms that are programmed to predict interaction propensities to molecules of diverse chemical properties, such as carbohydrates and haptens. As such, a large diversity of antibody libraries, which are not limited by the sequences found in natural antibodies, could be envisaged of being developed specifically targeting antigens of diverse chemical properties. In the future, these antibody library designs could be combined with computational methods for human T-cell epitope predictions<sup><xref rid="CIT0051">51</xref></sup> to avoid CDR sequences of potential immunogenicity so as to enhance the applicability of the synthetic antibody libraries for developing antibody therapeutics. These directions could lead to antibodies with optimal characteristics pertinent to their medical applications.</p></sec><sec id="S0004"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S0004-S2001"><title>Computational methods</title><sec id="S0004-S2001-S3001"><title>ISMBLab-PPI and ISMBLab-PEP predictors</title><p>The general principles and technical details of the ISMBLab-PPI/PEP predictors have been published previously.<sup><xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref>-<xref rid="CIT0029">29</xref></sup> Details of the computational methods are described in Supplementary Methods.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S0004-S2002"><title>Experimental methods</title><sec id="S0004-S2002-S3001"><title>Phage-displayed synthetic ScFV library construction and quality control by NGS</title><p>The construction and characterization of the phage-displayed synthetic scFv libraries followed the same procedure, without modification, as described in previously published studies.<sup><xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0021">21</xref></sup> Detailed methods are described in Supplementary Methods.
