This oomycete is highly variable and rapidly overcomes resistance genes and fungicides. The use of multiple read types results in a high-quality, near-chromosome-scale, consensus assembly.

Heterokaryosis has phenotypic consequences on fitness that may include an increased sporulation rate and qualitative differences in virulence. Therefore, selection should be considered as acting on a population of nuclei within coenocytic mycelia. This provides evolutionary flexibility to the pathogen enabling rapid adaptation to different repertoires of host resistance genes and other challenges. The advantages of asexual persistence of heterokaryons may have been one of the drivers of selection that resulted in the loss of uninucleate zoospores in multiple downy mildews.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">The oomycete <italic>Bremia lactucae</italic> is a highly variable pathogen that causes lettuce downy mildew.

The haploid genome size of this isolate and 38 others were estimated to be ~152&#x02009;Mb (+/&#x02212;3&#x02009;Mb) by flow cytometry (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). This 115&#x02009;Mb assembly contained 91&#x02009;Mb of sequence plus 24&#x02009;Mb of gaps. Subsequently, 87.9&#x02009;Mb (96.5%) of the assembled sequence was placed into 22 scaffolds over 1&#x02009;Mb using Hi-C; these totaled 112&#x02009;Mb including gaps.

The heterozygosity of isolate SF5 was 1.17% and ranged from 0.77% to 1.29% for other isolates. These levels ranked high compared with other oomycetes, the majority of which had less than 1% heterozygosity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). This level of heterozygosity resulted in some alleles not being collapsed into a consensus sequence, necessitating multiple rounds of condensation to achieve a close to haploid consensus assembly.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Genome and assembly features of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>lactucae</italic>. <bold>a</bold> Estimation of genome size of heterokaryotic isolate C82P24 by flow cytometry.

Red: K-mers present in the read set and once in the assembly. Purple: K-mers present in the read set and twice in the assembly. The first peak depicts heterozygous k-mers and the second peak depicts homozygous k-mers. A high-quality consensus assembly will contain half the k-mers in the first peak, the other half of which should be black due to heterozygosity, and all the k-mers in the second peak should be present only once, which therefore should be red.

Therefore, the assembly contains most of the single-copy portion of the genome. Repeat annotation followed by masking determined that 63&#x02009;Mb of the 91&#x02009;Mb assembled sequence was repetitive (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The majority of the annotated repeats were recently diverged long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs).

The average coverage of sequences annotated as repeats in the assembly was 2.1-fold higher than that of the annotated genes.

Homokaryotic derivatives G, H, and I of heterokaryotic isolate C98O622b are race Bl:5-US and derivative J has a novel virulence phenotype. The original field isolate C98O622b and heterokaryotic derivatives are race Bl:6-US, indicating that two phenotypically distinct isolates may combine to create a new phenotype when characterized on individual resistance genes, although such somatic hybrids may not be able to overcome combinations of these resistance genes in a single cultivar. Therefore, (a)virulence phenotypes on monogenic differentials are not necessarily a good predictor of virulence when heterokaryons are tested. The instability of heterokaryosis may enable a successful infection and proliferation of individual nuclear components. Furthermore, there is no a priori reason why coenocytic mycelia are limited to having only two nuclear types. Multiple rounds of somatic fusion are possible if favored by selection. Allele frequency plots are consistent with some isolates having more than two&#x000a0;distinct nuclei (e.g., isolate C04O1017; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>).

Of the 31 isolates sequenced to over 50x coverage, 18 were determined to have allele frequencies deviating from that of a homokaryon.
