Despite their relevance, many of the tools established for genome editing in other microorganisms are not available for Mycoplasmas. The Tn4001 transposon is the reference tool to work with these bacteria, but the transformation efficiencies (TEs) reported for the different species vary substantially. Here, we explore the mechanisms underlying these differences in four Mycoplasma species, <italic>Mycoplasma agalactiae</italic>, <italic>Mycoplasma feriruminatoris</italic>, <italic>Mycoplasma gallisepticum</italic> and <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic>, selected for being representative members of each cluster of the Mycoplasma genus. We found that regulatory regions (RRs) driving the expression of the transposase and the antibiotic resistance marker have a major impact on the TEs. We then designed a synthetic RR termed SynMyco RR to control the expression of the key transposon vector elements. Using this synthetic RR, we were able to increase the TE for <italic>M. gallisepticum</italic>, <italic>M. feriruminatoris</italic> and <italic>M. agalactiae</italic> by 30-, 980- and 1036-fold, respectively. Finally, to illustrate the potential of this new transposon, we performed the first essentiality study in <italic>M. agalactiae</italic>, basing our study on more than 199,000 genome insertions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Mycoplasma</kwd><kwd>transposon</kwd><kwd>regulatory region</kwd><kwd>transformation efficiency</kwd><kwd>essentiality</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">European Union&#x02019;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme</named-content></funding-source><award-id>634942</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">European Research Council (ERC)</named-content></funding-source><award-id>670216</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">MYCOCHASSIS</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (MEIC)</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Centro de Excelencia Severo Ochoa</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">CERCA Programme/Generalitat de Catalunya</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The <italic>Mollicutes</italic> class represents a taxonomic group of bacteria that has undergone an extreme genome downsizing process termed degenerative evolution.<xref rid="dsz012-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> As a consequence of this evolutionary process, these bacteria are characterized by the lack of a cell wall, streamlined genomes and very limited biosynthetic pathways.

Furthermore, these maps can also help in the identification of those genes that are not essential but whose disruption affects the fitness of the bacteria in a particular environment (i.e. fitness, F).

Such a poor adaptation of the Tn4001 transposon to Mycoplasmas might partially explain the dramatic differences observed among transformation efficiencies (TEs) in species from this genus.

Furthermore, a reporter assay allowed us to identify which of the RRs determining expression of the antibiotic resistance and transposase protein coding genes found in the native transposon vector were inefficiently recognized in each of the strains selected for this work.

These dilutions were selected so that fluorescent signals were clearly different from negative controls of each strain (i.e. not carrying fluorescent constructs) and proportional to the absorbance (i.e. not saturating signals). Fluorescence arbitrary units (AU) measured for Venus and mCherry were normalized to OD<sub>600nm</sub> for each condition (Venus AU/OD<sub>600</sub> and mCherry AU/OD<sub>600</sub>) to obtain normalized fluorescence AU. For each of the four strains of the work, the mCherry and Venus fluorescence levels of WT cells (i.e. not carrying any fluorescent construct) were determined and subtracted from the fluorescence values obtained for each condition, to obtain subtracted AU.

Design of an efficient regulatory region for a broad range of Mycoplasma species</title><p>Several aspects might influence the TE of a transposon vector and can be classified into two different categories. In the first category, we can include those factors that affect the TE of any vector, such as degradation of the plasmid by bacterial restriction machinery, or the optimality of the transformation protocol itself. Leaving these aside, there is a second group of factors that are specific for transposon vectors. Thus, once the vector has entered the cell, proper transcription/translation of the transposase coding gene is required for the correct insertion of the antibiotic resistance gene into the chromosome. Second, the insertion mutant would only be able to grow if the protein levels of the antibiotic resistance gene reach a certain threshold that is sufficient to promote growth on selective medium. Therefore, in an attempt to maximize the protein levels of both the transposase coding gene and the antibiotic resistance gene in all Mycoplasma species, we decided to design a RR termed SynMyco Regulatory Region (SynMyco RR) that would allow efficient transcription and translation in different mycoplasma species.</p><p>As a reference for the design, we chose the RR of MPN665, a gene whose transcript is in the top 5% of most transcribed genes in the transcriptome of <italic>M. pneumoniae.</italic><xref rid="dsz012-B41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> Also, its protein levels (2,646 copies per cell) are among the highest in the proteome of <italic>M. pneumoniae.</italic><xref rid="dsz012-B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> MPN665 encodes for the elongation factor thermo-unstable (EF-Tu) protein. As a main component of the ribosome, the protein product of this gene has an essential role in translation and is universally conserved in the prokaryotic world.<xref rid="dsz012-B42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dsz012-B43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> Thus, with the aim of identifying important elements, we aligned the RRs of MPN665 orthologues found in a representative set of Mycoplasma species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsz012-F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2A</xref>). For the design of the SynMyco RR, we mainly kept those bases found in the MPN665 RR that are not changed to another base in other species. However, given that native RRs did not evolve to be the most productive transcriptional drivers, we also favoured those bases that were found to be optimal as transcription/translation determinants in a recent screen of synthetic sequences.<xref rid="dsz012-B44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> This is exemplified by including an extended Pribnow box motif (TGN-Pribnow) within the SynMyco RR, a feature that is not found in any of the native EF-Tu RRs analysed but promotes higher transcription rates. Based on the screen mentioned above, we also changed the Pribnow box sequence from TAAAAT to the canonical TATAAT motif. Lastly, to ensure the functionality of the SynMyco RR in a broad range of Mycoplasma species, we paid special attention to other features found in the RRs such as the -35 box or the Shine-Dalgarno region (also known as, Ribosome Binding Site, RBS). In particular, the -35 box seems to have lost its prevalent role as a transcriptional driver during Mycoplasma evolution, as indicated by the absence of any consensus sequence among the most productive RRs found in the screen of synthetic sequences.<xref rid="dsz012-B44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> In fact, only a degenerated -35 box with the sequence TTGANN can be found in the RRs of just 20% of the genes of <italic>M. pneumoniae.</italic><xref rid="dsz012-B45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> However, as the most prevalent sequence found at the -35 area of the EF-Tu RRs analysed was TGC, we included this in the SynMyco RR. On the other hand, the Shine-Dalgarno region, which is responsible for ribosome docking onto the mRNA, is present in only 26% of <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> genes. In contrast, in other species such as <italic>M. agalactiae</italic>, it is found in as much as 73% of the coding sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsz012-F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2B</xref>). For this reason, we also included a Shine-Dalgarno region in the design of the SynMyco RR, using the sequence that is most frequently found in the EF-Tu RRs analysed (i.e. 5&#x02032;-AAAGGA-3&#x02032;).

In addition, while we have generated only a gentamicin version of the SynMyco transposon, we hypothesized that the other resistance markers available for Mycoplasmas (i.e. chloramphenicol, puromycin and tetracycline)<xref rid="dsz012-B18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> and already implemented in native Tn4001 transposon-derived vectors, might in the future be included in pMTnGm-SynMyco vector in substitution of the gentamicin resistance gene. This would allow the generation of a set of four different transposon vectors highly efficient in a broad range of Mycoplasmas. Furthermore, as was recently shown for <italic>M. genitalium</italic>, resistance genes can also be flanked by lox sites in vectors carrying the SynMyco RR thereby allowing the recycling of antibiotic markers when employing protocols that require the iterative use of transposon insertion mutagenesis.<xref rid="dsz012-B46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref></p></sec><sec><title>3.4. Strength comparison of SynMyco regulatory region and those in the native pMTnGm vector</title><p>In all species tested, the number of transformed cells was higher when transformed with pMTnGm-SynMyco vector than with unmodified pMTnGm vector. These results suggested that the protein yields of the transposase and/or the protein conferring resistance to gentamicin were major determinants of the TE. In order to find out which of the two gene products, or both, were responsible for the increase in TE, we developed a reporter assay. This reporter assay allows quantification of the relative strength of SynMyco RR compared with the RRs driving the expression of the transposase (i.e. Tnp RR) and the gentamicin resistance gene (i.e. Gm RR) in the native pMTnGm vector. To this end, we created three different vectors derived from the pMTnGm-SynMyco in which the genes coding for the mCherry and Venus fluorescent proteins were introduced for quantification and normalization purposes, respectively. The region controlling the expression levels of the mCherry protein varies between the three different vectors, being either SynMyco RR, Tnp RR or Gm RR, whereas the RR controlling the expression of Venus reporter is constant in all the constructs, being always SynMyco RR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsz012-F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4A</xref>). The three different constructs were transformed in all of the species studied in this work. Subsequently, the ratio between mCherry fluorescence and Venus fluorescence allowed us to determine the relative strength of each RR in <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsz012-F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4B</xref>), <italic>M. gallisepticum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsz012-F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4C</xref>), <italic>M. feriruminatoris</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsz012-F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4D</xref>) <italic>and M. agalactiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsz012-F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4E</xref>).

Sequencing of individual insertion clones is useful to classify the genes within the F-NE categories (i.e. genes disrupted by a transposon insertion) but cannot distinguish between both. Examples of this limitation are the genes coding for a tRNA modification GTPase and for the deoxyribonuclease IV. In the <italic>M. bovis</italic> essentiality study, both genes (i.e. MBOVPG45_0060 and MBOVPG45_0301) were classified as NE given the isolation of individual clones carrying insertions within their coding region. However, our essentiality study based on the analysis of at least 600 times more mutants than the one of <italic>M. bovis</italic> and mapped by ultra sequencing classified these two genes (i.e. MAGA7784_RS00280 and MAGA7784_RS02715) as F in <italic>M. agalactiae</italic>. This implies that although these genes are non-essential, their disruption cause a growth impairment of these particular clones at least for <italic>M. agalactiae</italic>, something that cannot be directly measured by genomic sequencing of transposon insertion in a limited number of clones.</p><p>Moreover, aside from its lack of accuracy in distinguishing between NE and F genes, the main limitation of small transposon libraries is related with E genes. Specifically, the low coverage of these libraries makes it difficult to ascertain whether a gene is free of insertions because of its essential character or as a result of the randomness of the integration and/or low sampling of the mutants. Indeed, only two genes were suggested by the authors as highly probable essential genes in the <italic>M. bovis</italic> study, MBOVPG45_0337 and MBOVPG45_0710, coding for an ATP-binding protein and SGNH/GDSL hydrolase, respectively. This assumption was based on the lack of clones carrying a transposon insertion within the coding regions of these genes in spite of their large size (i.e. 3420&#x000a0;bp for MBOVPG45_0337 and 8013&#x000a0;bp for MBOVPG45_0710). Nonetheless, it should be noted that the insertional coverage of the mutant library of this study, with one insertion every 3145&#x000a0;bp of the genome on average, is in the same range of these genes in terms of size. In our <italic>M. agalactiae</italic> essentiality study, the orthologue of the SGNH/GDSL hydrolase coding gene (i.e. MAGA7784_RS03410) was found E, confirming the hypothesis of the <italic>M. bovis</italic> report. In contrast, the gene coding for the ATP-binding protein (i.e. MAGA7784_RS02615) was determined as NE as indicated by the presence of 891 transposon insertions within its sequence. This suggests that the absence of clones carrying an insertion within MBOVPG45_0337 gene is most likely a consequence of the low coverage of the insertional library, rather than the gene being truly essential in <italic>M. bovis.</italic> Furthermore, the limitation of low coverage libraries to assign a truly E character for a given gene is even more evident with small coding sequences. For instance, in <italic>M. bovis</italic> there were no clones found to carry a transposon insertion within the coding sequences of genes MBOVPG45_0043 (582&#x000a0;bp) or MBOVPG45_0596 (963&#x000a0;bp), coding for sigma-70 RNA polymerase factor and Holliday junction branch migration DNA helicase ruvB, respectively. This might indicate that these genes are E. However, homologues of these genes are fully covered with transposon insertions not only in <italic>M. agalactiae</italic> (MAGA7784_RS00215 and MAGA7784_RS01205), but also in <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> (MPN626 and MPN536), suggesting the lack of insertions in the <italic>M. bovis</italic> study is more likely related with the small size of the genes rather than with their essential character. All of these examples illustrate the importance of high coverage transposon insertion libraries for the appropriate category assignment of a given gene, something that can be only achieved with efficient transposon vectors such as pMTnGm-SynMyco.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that the RRs driving the expression of the transposase and the resistance genes have a tremendous impact on the TE achieved after vector transformation. Although problems derived from poor recognition of vector RRs can be avoided with transformation procedures based on purified transposases,<xref rid="dsz012-B51" ref-type="bibr"><sup>51</sup></xref> it should be noted that not all transposases are commercially available and their cost might limit use in many research groups. Indeed, screening libraries of RRs for the key elements of transposon vectors has already been shown to be a useful strategy to produce a moderate increase (i.e. around one order of magnitude) in the TE of different bacteria.<xref rid="dsz012-B52" ref-type="bibr"><sup>52</sup></xref> However, an approach such as the one followed in our study involving rational design of RRs rather than the screen of a limited number of variants might be more effective in increasing TE. In fact, we have seen that the pMTnGm-SynMyco vector significantly increases the TE in three phylogenetically distant Mycoplasma species. For this reason, we hypothesize that this vector might improve the reported TE in all species belonging to the Mycoplasma genus. Even though we have shown that the SynMyco RR is efficiently recognized in different species, it cannot be excluded that other designs of RRs could also lead to an increase in TE. As exemplified in this work with <italic>M. agalactiae</italic>, the higher TE obtained using this vector may unblock the development of new essentiality maps for other Mycoplasma species, and thereby promote global knowledge of these interesting microorganisms. In addition, the higher insertional coverage obtained with the pMTnGm-SynMyco vector should facilitate the isolation of clones of interest from libraries of insertional mutants, an advancement which may boost gene-function assignments in Mycoplasma species that have been poorly studied so far.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>dsz012_Supplementary_Data</label><media xlink:href="dsz012_supplementary_data.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ACK1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr Sarah A.
