Samples were subsequently used for enrichment cultures (inoculation 1% (v/v)) with 0.35% (v/v) octocrylene as carbon source. After 14 days, grown cultures were transferred into fresh medium with two subsequent streakings. Repeatedly, biomass formation on the octocrylene droplet surface could be observed and the medium became turbid compared to the controls. In order to investigate the community composition of the culture, DGGE analysis was performed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.

This approach is based on taking use of already isolated and deposited pure strains, showing high identities to the identified 16S rRNA genes amplified from the organisms of the enrichment culture. Highly identical strains can be purchased from culture collections, in order to identify the most efficient strains capable of degrading octocrylene. Likewise, several deposited strains at the German Culture Collection (DSMZ) belonging to the genera <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> and <italic>Gordonia</italic>, whose 16S rRNA gene showed high identities to the DGGE-identified ones, were tested for their ability to grow in modified DSM media 645 and 65 at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 30&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in the presence of 0.35% (v/v) octocrylene.
