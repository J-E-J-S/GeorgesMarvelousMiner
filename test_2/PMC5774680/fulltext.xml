Given concerns relating to the toxicity of modern VACV vaccines, we asked whether an HPXV-based vaccine might provide a superior alternative. Since HPXV may be extinct and the only specimen of HPXV that has been identified is unavailable for investigation, we explored whether HPXV could be obtained by large-scale gene synthesis. Ten large (10&#x02013;30 kb) fragments of DNA were synthesized based on the HPXV sequence along with two 157 nt VACV terminal sequences, and were recombined into a live synthetic chimeric HPXV (scHPXV) in cells infected with Shope fibroma virus (SFV). Sequencing of the 212 kbp scHPXV confirmed it encoded a faithful copy of the input DNA. We believe this is the first complete synthesis of a poxvirus using synthetic biology approaches. This scHPXV produced smaller plaques, produced less extracellular virus and exhibited less virulence in mice than VACV, but still provided vaccine protection against a lethal VACV challenge. Collectively, these findings support further development of scHPXV as a novel replication-proficient smallpox vaccine.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was performed under a research agreement with Tonix Pharmaceuticals.

Jenner noted that farriers sometimes milked cows and that material from the equine disease could produce a vesicular disease in cows from which <italic>variolae vaccinae</italic> was derived. Loy [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and Bell [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] subsequently showed that horsepox could vaccinate humans against smallpox and these meticulous studies raise the question of whether HPXV might still serve as a live smallpox vaccine. Most of today&#x02019;s VACV stocks comprise swarms of viruses that are products of ~200 years of cultivation in animals along with selection for growth in humans, and have probably evolved far from Jenner&#x02019;s virus. These replication-proficient and human-adapted VACV strains can cause myopericarditis in otherwise healthy individuals [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and are harmful in immunocompromised populations [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, a safer live vaccine would permit its more widespread use. However, only one specimen of HPXV has ever been identified and sequenced [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], very little is known about its biological properties, and the disease may have been accidentally extirpated [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This challenge led us to explore whether a replicating HPXV could be recovered by genome synthesis and might also exhibit vaccine properties.</p><p>Gene synthesis has revolutionized the study of microbes including viruses such as &#x003a6;X174, polio, and influenza [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, poxviruses represent special challenges because of the size (many exceed 200 kbp) and the difficulty of cloning features such as the mismatched hairpin telomeres [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188453.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Poxviruses also cannot simply be recovered from transfected cells, as the DNA is not infectious. What has been long known is that a cell infected with one poxvirus can reactivate a second, if that second virus has been rendered inert by damaging the particles [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] or extracting the DNA [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. One can also perform the reactivation in cells that support the growth of different helper and reactivated viruses and then use differences in host range to separate the two. We have previously shown that SFV-infected cells offer such an advantage while providing an environment capable of assembling VACV from virus-derived restriction fragments [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Here we found that a replicating synthetic-chimeric HPXV with VACV hairpins can be rescued from SFV-infected cells using chemically synthesized DNA fragments. This scHPXV produced smaller plaques and less secondary plaque formation <italic>in vitro</italic>. In mice, scHPXV was less virulent compared to a known vaccine strain of VACV, but still provided vaccine protection against a lethal VACV challenge. Collectively, these findings support further development of scHPXV as a novel replication-proficient smallpox vaccine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Viruses and cell culture</title><p>SFV strain Kasza, VACV strain Western Reserve (WR), BSC-40, HeLa, Vero, and human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts were originally obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.

Contemporary accounts [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188453.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] provide support for Jenner&#x02019;s speculation that the vaccine probably originated as an equine disease called &#x0201c;grease&#x0201d;. Most notably Loy showed that one of two forms of grease (or horsepox) characterized by a diffuse pox reaction, provided protection against smallpox without requiring passage through cows [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Modern sequencing supports this hypothesis with the one known HPXV strain most closely resembling both old French [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and early American [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] smallpox vaccines, and sharing a common origin with all known VACV [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Further support for a shared origin is provided by the observation that the I4L locus in a rare Dryvax clone (DPP17), encodes a block of sequence and a frameshift mutation that most closely resembles the homologous locus in HPXV [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Using the HPXV genome sequence [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], synthetic DNA fragments, and methods outlined elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], we have used recombination and reactivation reactions to recreate this HPXV strain. This scHPXV resembles VACV in many of its growth properties, although it produces much smaller plaques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188453.g004">Fig 4a</xref>) without the secondary plaques associated with extracellular virus, which may partly explain the reduced virulence. Whether the increased infectivity and virulence of VACV reflects two centuries of selection in alternative hosts, including passage in humans, is an interesting question and because VACV-HPXV hybrids are viable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188453.g002">Fig 2</xref>), such strains might provide a tool for identifying some of the gene(s) responsible. Of perhaps most interest is the fact that our scHPXV strain generates immune protection against lethal virus challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188453.g005">Fig 5</xref>), and if the lower virulence in mice reflects better tolerability in humans, it supports further investigation as a vaccine and vector.</p><p>The method described here could be adapted to assemble other Orthopoxviruses, and possibly other Chordopoxviruses if the right helper virus(es) and supporting cell lines can be identified. This is timely as poxviruses offer much promise as oncolytic agents [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188453.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and better ways are needed to more rapidly and extensively engineer these agents to provoke potent anti-tumour immune responses; ideally using designs based on personalized cancer neo-antigens. These synthetic approaches also provide tools for investigating certain basic features of virus genome structure (for example the mismatched and flip/flop hairpin telomeres) that are still incompletely understood 3&#x02013;4 decades after they were discovered [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>That said this is clearly an example of dual use research, and observations like these poses significant challenges for public health authorities. Most viruses could be assembled nowadays using reverse genetics, and these methods have been combined with gene synthesis technologies to assemble poliovirus [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and other extinct pathogens like the 1918 influenza strain [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Given that the sequence of variola virus has been known since 1993 [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], our studies show that it is clearly accessible to current synthetic biology technology, with important implications for public health and biosecurity [<xref rid="pone.0188453.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Our hope is that this work will promote new and informed public health discussions relating to synthetic biology, stimulate new evaluation of HPXV-based vaccines, and advance the capacity to rapidly produce next-generation vaccines and poxvirus-based therapeutics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0188453.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0188453.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0188453.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Construction of hairpin-terminated left and right ITRs.</title><p><bold>a</bold>.
