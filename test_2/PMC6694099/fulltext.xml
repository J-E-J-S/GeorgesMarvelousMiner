Metallothioneins, a group of cysteine-rich metal-ion binding proteins, are known to be a key physiological mechanism in regulating protection against metal toxicity. Many rivers across the southwest of England are detrimentally affected by metal pollution, but brown trout (<italic>Salmo trutta</italic> L.) populations are known to reside within them. In this body of work, two isoforms of metallothionein (<italic>MetA</italic> and <italic>MetB</italic>) isolated from trout occupying a polluted and a control river are examined. Using synthetic genetic array (SGA) analyses in the model yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, functional genomics is used to explore the role of metallothionein isoforms in driving metal tolerance. By harnessing this experimental system, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is used to (i) determine the genetic interaction maps of <italic>MetA</italic> and <italic>MetB</italic> isoforms; (ii) identify differences between the genetic interactions in both isoforms and (iii) demonstrate that pre-exposure to metals in metal-tolerant trout influences these interactions.

The southwest of England was once an important region for metal mining<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Although mining in the region has ceased, many rivers remain polluted with metals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Despite evidence that these rivers contain metal concentrations known to affect fish physiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>; populations of resident brown trout (<italic>Salmo trutta</italic> L.) are found within them. Study of these metal-tolerant trout populations has shown that their genetic structure is different compared to fish from neighbouring control rivers, and that these demographic changes have occurred in association with periods of increased mining activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.

Importantly, one of the key genetic mechanisms involved in metal tolerance includes the induction of metallothioneins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Metallothioneins (MTs) have been shown to play an important role in metal ion homeostasis and the detoxification of metals in fish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. MTs are a family of low molecular weight, cysteine-rich proteins, which consist of an especially high number of thiol groups and a lack of generic secondary structure motifs. MTs have the capacity to bind both physiological (e.g. copper, zinc) and xenobiotic (e.g. arsenic, cadmium) metals through the thiol group of cysteine residues, which can represent up to 30% of its constituent amino acids. Following the whole genome duplication (WGD) event in salmonids, two metallothionein isoforms exist in brown trout<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The brown trout does not yet have an assembled genome, yet in the closely related Atlantic salmon (<italic>Salmo salar</italic>), these two MT isoforms (hereafter <italic>MetA</italic> and <italic>MetB</italic>) are known to occur on different chromosomes (<italic>MetA:</italic> chromosome ssa16; <italic>MetB:</italic> chromosome ssa10) and the two isoforms have been shown to be differentially involved in response to metals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Synthetic Genetic Array (SGA) analysis is an unbiased method for the identification of synthetic genetic interactions, used for describing the interaction partners of proteins and specifically, in targeting synthetic genetic interactors. To date, SGA analysis has not been adopted as a general conceptual framework in functional genomics, largely because robust methods for identifying such interactions did not exist. However, in 2005, synthetic lethal interactions between mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 or BRCA2) and members of the poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) enzyme superfamily were identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. These studies demonstrate the validity of using synthetic lethality as a novel approach in identifying components of a genetic network. The utilization of SGA screens, using yeast as a bait to express an exogenous gene, highlights the robustness of this technique, and suggest its usage can be extended to other systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Although these experiments are performed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, SGA relies on the mating ability of this versatile yeast and such methods are therefore applicable to the analysis of interactions for metal tolerance in brown trout. Moreover, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is known to be intrinsically sensitive to metal stress. This makes it an ideal model organism to test the effects of over-expressing genes that may be involved in metal tolerance.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we aimed to explore whether a model organism, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, could be used to explore the role of metallothioneins in conferring metal tolerance in a non-model species, the brown trout. Synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis is used to examine two metallothionein isoforms isolated from brown trout occupying a metal-impacted river and a control river. In particular, aims were to (i) determine the genetic interaction maps of <italic>MetA</italic> and <italic>MetB</italic>; (ii) identify the subtle differences between these genetic interactions in both isoforms of the gene and (iii) establish whether pre-exposure to metal contaminants in metal-tolerant trout influences these interactions.

The first goal was to construct the SGA starter strains with improved tolerance to the different metals (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) Four plasmids were constructed, one expressing <italic>MetA</italic> from fish originating from the Camel river (<italic>MetA_Cam</italic>), one expressing <italic>MetB</italic> from the Camel trout (<italic>MetB_Cam</italic>) and two further plasmids containing <italic>MetA</italic> and <italic>MetB</italic> isolated from the metal-tolerant Hayle fish (<italic>MetA_Hay</italic> and <italic>MetB_Hay</italic>).

SGA analysis revealed a total of 56 genetic interactions for the Camel and 69 for the Hayle. Interestingly, GO term enrichment showed groups of genes involved in both metabolism and transport. Of the 56 Camel genetic interactions, only one was unique to the Camel, which showed a synthetic sick (SS) phenotype: <italic>Ace2</italic>, a transcription factor for cytokinesis and a known activator of CUP1 expression, a metallothionein that binds copper and mediates resistance to high concentrations of copper and cadmium in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. The remaining interactions were common interactors with those identified in the <italic>MetB_Hayle</italic> screen, for which 3 were synthetic lethal in both <italic>MetB_Camel</italic> and <italic>MetB_Hayle</italic>: TSA2; a stress inducible cytoplasmic thioredoxin peroxidase, EAF1; a component of a histone acetyltransferase complex, which is also known to act for initiation of pre-meiotic DNA replication, and GRX7; which plays a role in oxidative stress response. The differences observed in the genetic interactions between <italic>MetB_Camel</italic> and <italic>MetB_Hayle</italic> is likely due to an amino-acid function change in the <italic>MetB</italic> of the Hayle fish, although in <italic>in vivo</italic>, multiple additional mechanisms are likely influencing these differences; for example, adaptive mutation in promoter regions, Cis-regulatory modules and copy number variation (CNVs). The SGA screen employed here is a first step in quantifying these differences and therefore provides future avenues to explore these mechanisms further.</p><p id="Par12">In comparison, the <italic>MetB_Hayle</italic> SGA screen identified 60 genetic interactors, of which 12 were unique to the Hayle. Of these 12 interactions, 5 were SL and 7 SS were interactions, including 2 genes involved in metabolism (THI3 and TRR1); one gene involved with transport (FET5); one gene involved in protein transport (VSP60) and MAC1, which had an unknown GO term. In particular, the SL interactions (<italic>TRR1; THI3; FET5; VPS60</italic> and <italic>MAC1)</italic> unique to <italic>MetB_</italic>Hayle observed here, suggest that exposure to metals in these fish may drive complex genetic interactions for metal tolerance <italic>in vivo</italic>. Of particular interest is the SL interaction between <italic>MetB_Hayle</italic> and <italic>MAC1</italic>; a copper sensing transcription factor that is involved in the regulations of genes required for metal transport, in addition to a role in hydrogen peroxide induced transcription of <italic>CTT1</italic>, which is important in protection from oxidative damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">Both MT gene interaction maps were enriched for genes involved in DNA binding (average p-value 1.942e-11). The interactions from the Camel fish also showed further enrichment for genes involved in sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity (p-value 5.202e-050) and metal ion binding (p-value 0.0008715), with the <italic>MetB</italic> dataset being enriched for peroxidase activity (p-value 7.271e-05). The interactions from the Hayle fish showed enrichment for genes involved in metal ion binding (p-value 7.758e-05), metal ion transmembrane activity (p-value 0.0001717) and peroxidase activity (p-value 0.0001294), which are all known to be important gene families involved in the detoxification of cells after exposure to high levels of toxic compounds, namely metal ions. The differences in the interaction maps suggest the potential different evolutionary pathways adopted by the two trout individuals. Previous research also points to differences in the roles that these two MT isoforms play in conferring metal tolerance in trout. In global transcriptome profiling of Hayle trout, <italic>MetB</italic> was among the most strongly up-regulated genes across four different tissues examined, whereas the <italic>MetA</italic> isoform was expressed at very low levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In cultured gill tissue exposed to metal-contaminated water from the Hayle, qPCR expression of both isoforms was elevated compared to controls, but different expression profiles were observed depending on the metal concentrations; with <italic>MetB</italic> showing elevated expression when concentrations were particularly high<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. This suggests that the expression of the metallothionein isoforms contribute to metal tolerance in these trout, although other mechanisms are also likely operating.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par14">Through synthetic genetic array (SGA) screens, we have demonstrated how utilization of functional genomic technologies can be used to explore the evolution of metal tolerance in brown trout. Genetic interaction profiles were determined for two salmonid isoforms of metallothioneins, <italic>MetA</italic> and <italic>MetB</italic>, highlighting key differences in the genetic interactions of MT isoforms between metal-tolerant trout (Hayle) and fish from a control river (Camel). The expression of <italic>MetA</italic> from either the Hayle or Camel trout showed an increased tolerance to many of the metals screened for both, singly, or in combination. However, the most poignant finding from this first published screen of brown trout MT isoforms in an SGA analysis, are the differences in the genetic interactions between the <italic>MetB</italic> isoforms isolated from metal-tolerant trout, compared to control fish. This suggests that <italic>MetB</italic> is an important component of metal tolerance in these fish. In conclusion, the expertise of SGA has been used to identify both the conserved and unique synthetic genetic interactions across two MT isoforms in a non-model species. This provides an inventory of conserved MT synthetic lethal interactions that can be further investigated for their utility in contributing to the evolution of metal tolerance in brown trout.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>DNA extraction and gene amplification</title><p id="Par15">For the amplification and expression of the two isoforms of interest (<italic>MetA</italic> and <italic>MetB</italic>) in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, DNA was isolated from two brown trout, one metal-tolerant fish from the River Hayle (50.14128, &#x02212;5.411024) and a fish from a comparatively clean control river, the River Camel (50.579, &#x02212;4.733) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

P-values were calculated using the hypergeometric distribution and represent the probability that the intersection of a given list with any given functional category occurs by chance. The Bonferroni correction divided the p-value threshold which would be deemed significant for an individual test by the number of tests conducted and therefore accounts for significance due to multiple testings over the categories of the database. Following the Bonferroni correction, only categories are displayed which the chance probability of enrichment is lower that the p-value (0.01).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec13"><p>
