In the presence of benzoate, BenR binds to the P<sub>Ben</sub> promoter and activates transcription (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). To engineer a cell-free biosensor detecting benzoate, we cloned BenR under the control of the OR2-OR1-Pr promoter, a modified version of the lambda phage repressor promoter Cro, known to express strongly in cell-free systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The P<sub>Ben</sub> promoter driving superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) was cloned in a separate plasmid. After initial pilot tests demonstrated that BenR was functional in a cell-free environment, we optimized the BenR biosensor by titrating the DNA concentration of the TF and reporter plasmids.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Calibration of sensor and output modules for benzoate detection. <bold>a</bold> BenR binds to the P<sub>Ben</sub> promoter in the presence of benzoate and activates gene expression. Here, BenR is cloned in the pBEAST plasmid (a derivative of pBEST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>) and driven by a strong constitutive promoter, OR2-OR1-Pr. The P<sub>Ben</sub> promoter is cloned into another pBEAST backbone and drives expression of superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP). As the system operates without a cellular boundary, multiple plasmids encoding different components of the network can easily be used simultaneously.

As such, the process of finding an optimal DNA concentration is relatively straightforward: we created a matrix of DNA concentrations for TF and reporter plasmids between 0 and 100&#x02009;nM, and induced these different cell-free reactions using four different concentrations of benzoic acid: 0, 10, 100, and 1000&#x02009;&#x000b5;M (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">Encouragingly, the system had extremely low background signal in the absence of benzoic acid, indicating that the P<sub>Ben</sub> promoter has very little &#x0201c;leakiness&#x0201d; in a cell-free environment. When benzoic acid was added to the reaction, the sfGFP output signal was clearly detectable and fluorescence intensity was correlated with increasing reporter plasmid concentration. However, the signal reached a plateau for increasing concentrations of TF plasmid at 30&#x02009;nM. We hypothesize that this plateau is due to competition for transcriptional and translational resources between TF and reporter plasmids. This plateau is also observed in a mathematical model of cell-free biosensors (Supplementary Notes&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>-<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

We cloned each enzyme into the cell-free expression vector and, using the optimized DNA concentrations of TF and reporter plasmids, titrated different concentrations of metabolic transducer DNA for a range of inducer inputs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a clear peak in sfGFP signal corresponding to a particular concentration effectiveness: 3&#x02009;nM for HipO and 10&#x02009;nM for CocE. We built several mathematical models based on different assumptions that could reproduce the observed bell-shaped response to enzyme DNA concentration as well as its shift between the two enzymes (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Based on these models, we hypothesized that the observed bell-shaped response is likely due to competition between the different modules, leading to an important and unnecessary enzyme production at high DNA concentrations that diverts resources such as RNA polymerase, ribosomes, and energy from sfGFP transcription and translation, as well as generates toxic byproducts. Moreover, we provide evidence that the shifting peak between the two setups is most likely due to lower expression of CocE (<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Notes</xref>&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>-<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4</xref>).

Therefore, to test our sensor&#x02019;s ability to quantify benzoates, we performed an experiment with a 1:10 dilution, which showed minimal reaction interference (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">9</xref>), and converted the resulting fluorescence intensities to concentrations using a calibration curve from a benzoic acid standard (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">10</xref>). These results were compared against measurements from liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Seven of the ten drinks showed very strong agreement between the quantitative results from our sensor and the LC-MS results. Three of the beverages (Monster&#x000ae; Absolutely Zero, Monster&#x000ae; Ultra, and Monster&#x000ae; Ultra Red) had diminished cell-free values relative to those from LC-MS. Taken together, these results demonstrate that our sensors can remain functional in commercial products and rapidly detect and quantify benzoates.</p><p id="Par17">We then wanted to test whether our hippuric acid sensor could detect endogenous levels of a molecule of interest in a clinical context. Hippuric acid has long been known to be regularly excreted by humans in urine as the end product of several different aromatic compounds, including benzoates, which are converted in the liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Hippuric acid&#x000a0;has been correlated with high levels of toluene exposure in some operational conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In addition, recent research by Isabella et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> used hippuric acid&#x000a0; as a biomarker for monitoring&#x000a0;the efficacy of treatment against phenylketonuria, a neurotoxic disease characterized by the inability to process the amino acid phenylalanine. We thus wanted to test whether our sensor could detect clinical levels of endogenous hippuric acid in human urine. When adding 2&#x02009;&#x000b5;L of a 1:10 dilution to a 20&#x02009;&#x000b5;L reaction (1% cell-free reaction concentration), we found little interference from urine to expression of a constitutive GFP plasmid relative to the positive control (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">11</xref>). When testing the urine for hippuric acid, we observed little to no response from our benzoic acid sensor (without the HipO-expressing plasmid) (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4</xref>), but the complete hippuric acid sensor gave levels that fell within our calibration curve (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">12</xref>). Urinary hippuric acid concentrations estimated using our cell-free biosensor closely matched the values determined by LC-MS (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.98; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">13</xref>, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">5</xref>). These data are a promising step toward developing cell-free biosensors for biomarker detection in clinical samples.</p><p id="Par18">Finally, we aimed to detect cocaine in clinically relevant conditions. Cocaine rapidly enters the bloodstream after ingestion and is subsequently detectable in the urine for up to 10&#x02009;h<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. To determine whether our system could detect clinically relevant cocaine levels, we spiked urine samples with increasing concentrations of cocaine and added 2&#x02009;&#x000b5;L to 20&#x02009;&#x000b5;L cell-free reactions with our optimized cocaine biosensor. Our initial experiment showed small but detectable sfGFP signal at urinary concentration of 1000&#x02009;&#x000b5;M, but our system was unable to show adequate fold change at lower, clinically relevant concentrations (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">14</xref>). We found that cell-free reactions produce increasing low levels of noise over time in the GFP fluorescence channel (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">15</xref>) and hypothesized that we could increase our signal-to-noise ratio by changing our reporter to luciferase. We cloned the firefly luciferase gene under control of the P<sub>Ben</sub> promoter and in an initial test indeed observed an increase in signal-to-noise ratio (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">16</xref>). We then added increasing cocaine concentrations into six different samples containing our cell-free cocaine sensor with the luciferase reporter (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Five of the six sample showed strong fold change, with detectable fold changes of 4.3&#x02013;8.8 at previous clinically detected cocaine concentrations in urine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. One sample (U3) showed minimal fold change due to high background signal that was also observed using the benzoic acid sensor (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">17</xref>). As the urine samples were supplied by subjects from the endocrinology department, it is possible that the medical condition of this patient resulted in interfering metabolites in the urine that can activate the BenR system. This background signal was minimal when we detected hippuric acid in urine, likely because of the urine samples dilution step (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4</xref>). In conclusion, these data demonstrate that our cell-free biosensors can be used to detect clinically relevant levels of drugs and endogenous metabolites in pure, unprocessed clinical samples.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par19">This work demonstrates that we can engineer modular, cell-free biosensors that can be easily calibrated to have high signal strength and dynamic range and can function in complex detection environments. Upon engineering a cell-free biosensor for benzoic acid, we show that the system can be scaled by using different metabolic transducer modules to expand the chemical space that each sensor/reporter pair can detect. In addition, we provide a three order-of-magnitude titration for each DNA component to optimize cell-free biosensor performance along with a mathematical model enabling a better understanding of the parameters governing cell-free biosensor response, which will help future optimization of such devices. By demonstrating that these sensors can function in samples from the food and beverage industry, as well as complex clinical samples such as human urine, we provide an example for their potential outside the lab in real-world applications. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that cell-free biosensors have been used to detect endogenous molecules in unprocessed samples.</p><p id="Par20">Using our workflow, this process should be applicable to a wide range of other sensor/reporter pairs. One constraint of our system is that the TF must respond only to the product of the enzymatic reaction and not the substrate. Such potential crosstalk can easily be checked by running a control reaction without the metabolic transducer module. We computed that 1205 disease-associated biomarkers from the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) could be converted into detectable molecules by one enzymatic reaction (Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref> and Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In addition, 64 HMDB metabolites could be transformed into benzoate and thus theoretically connected via a metabolic transducer to our optimized sensor (Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref> and Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">Further improvements to our platform could include exploring sample pre-processing methods that could increase&#x000a0;sensor robustness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> together with adaptation into an off-the-shelf format more amenable to point-of-care applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.
