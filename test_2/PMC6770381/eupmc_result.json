    "SECONDARY WALL-ASSOCIATED NAC DOMAIN1 (SND1) is a master regulator of fibre secondary wall deposition in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), with homologs in other angiosperms and gymnosperms. However, it is poorly understood to what extent the fibre-specific regulation of the SND1 promoter, and that of its orthologs, is conserved between diverged herbaceous and woody lineages. We performed a reciprocal reporter gene analysis of orthologous SND1 promoters from Arabidopsis (AthSND1), Eucalyptus grandis (EgrNAC61) and Populus alba × P. grandidentata (PagWND1A) relative to secondary cell wall-specific Cellulose Synthase4 (CesA4) and CesA7 promoters, in both a non-woody (Arabidopsis) and a woody (poplar) system. β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter analysis in Arabidopsis showed that the SND1 promoter was active in vascular tissues as previously reported and showed interfascicular and xylary fibre-specific expression in inflorescence stems, while reporter constructs of the woody plant-derived promoters were partial to the (pro)cambium-phloem and protoxylem. In transgenic P. tremula × P. alba plants, all three orthologous SND1 promoters expressed the GUS reporter similarly and preferentially in developing secondary xylem, ray parenchyma and cork cambium. Ours is the first study to reciprocally test orthologous SND1 promoter specificity in herbaceous and woody species, revealing diverged regulatory functions in the herbaceous system."
