Aberrant splicing isoforms and abnormal isoform ratios can contribute to cancer development. Kinase genes are key regulators of multiple cellular processes. Many kinases are found to be oncogenic and have been intensively investigated in the study of cancer and drugs. RNA-Seq provides a powerful technology for genome-wide study of alternative splicing in cancer besides the conventional gene expression profiling. But this potential has not been fully demonstrated yet.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We characterized the transcriptome profile of prostate cancer using RNA-Seq data from viewpoints of both differential expression and differential splicing, with an emphasis on kinase genes and their splicing variations. We built a pipeline to conduct differential expression and differential splicing analysis, followed by functional enrichment analysis. We performed kinase domain analysis to identify the functionally important candidate kinase gene in prostate cancer, and calculated the expression levels of isoforms to explore the function of isoform switching of kinase genes in prostate cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">We identified distinct gene groups from differential expression and splicing analyses, which suggested that alternative splicing adds another level to gene expression regulation. Enriched GO terms of differentially expressed and spliced kinase genes were found to play different roles in regulation of cellular metabolism. Function analysis on differentially spliced kinase genes showed that differentially spliced exons of these genes are significantly enriched in protein kinase domains. Among them, we found that gene CDK5 has isoform switching between prostate cancer and benign tissues, which may affect cancer development by changing androgen receptor (AR) phosphorylation. The observation was validated in another RNA-Seq dataset of prostate cancer cell lines.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Our work characterized the expression and splicing profiles of kinase genes in prostate cancer and proposed a hypothetical model on isoform switching of CDK5 and AR phosphorylation in prostate cancer.

It is ubiquitous in human cells, and about 95% of human multi-exon genes undergo this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The multiple protein isoforms generated with this mechanism play critical roles in diverse cellular processes such as cell cycle control, differentiation and cell signaling, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Aberrant alternative splicing has been reported to be highly relevant to many human diseases including cancer. Many cancer-related genes undergo alternative splicing and cancer-specific alternative splicing events have been found to contribute to carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. RNA-Seq technology and bioinformatics methods have provided great opportunities for studying alternative splicing in cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Prostate cancer is a major type of cancer in men. Normal prostate tissue development needs steady activity of androgens with androgen receptors (AR). AR is an important transcription factor that regulates the expression of many downstream genes. AR transcriptional activity, i.e., its regulatory activity on downstream genes, is modulated by interactions of AR and co-regulators. Some kinase-related signal transduction pathways can regulate AR transcriptional activities via phosphorylation of AR and AR co-regulators, which may be a main mechanism to maintain AR transcriptional activity in AR-negative prostate cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Protein kinases are one of the largest gene families in human and they constitute ~&#x02009;1.7% of human genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Mutations and dysregulation of protein kinases have been found to be causal for some human diseases, and especially for cancer. Efforts have been made to target oncogenic kinases by developing inhibitors for disease therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Merkin et al. revealed that a large percentage of alternative splicing events often contribute to alterations in protein phosphorylation and kinase signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It has been observed that some aberrant splicing events can modify kinase activities by truncating the kinase domain or fine-tuning the binding specificity to functional partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Many efforts have been devoted to the study of kinases that are deregulated in cancer and may serve as potential targets for cancer treatment. Differential expression of kinase genes in prostate cancer has been studied with RT-PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], but the alternative splicing of these genes have not been systematically studied in prostate cancer. In this study, using an RNA-Seq dataset published by Kannan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], we characterized the transcriptome profile in prostate cancer on both differential expression and differential splicing, with emphases on kinase genes and their splicing isoforms. We profiled genes that are differentially expressed (DE) and differentially spliced (DS) between prostate cancer and benign tissues, and used GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses to reveal their distinct functions in prostate cancer. We studied the kinases among the detected genes and identified kinases that may have function alterations caused by differential splicing through protein domain analysis. Among them, CDK5 was detected to undergo isoform switching between prostate cancer and benign tissues, which suggests an important regulatory role of CDK5 alternative splicing on AR phosphorylation in prostate cancer. The result was validated on another RNA-Seq dataset of prostate cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and also has implications regarding the difference between androgen-dependent and androgen-independent cancer progressions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par8">To characterize the transcriptome profile in prostate cancer, we analyzed an RNA-Seq dataset by Kannan et al.

The pipeline of the analysis is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The RNA-Seq data of 20 prostate cancer and ten matched benign tissue samples were downloaded from NCBI SRA database (accession number SRP002628). Another prostate cancer cell line dataset was obtained for validation from SRA (accession number SRP004637), which contain 58 RNA-Seq samples from 21 prostate cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The short sequencing reads were first remapped to human reference genome using TopHat (version 1.4.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Uniquely mapped reads with no more than two mismatches were kept for downstream analyses.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overview of data analysis pipeline. After mapping the RNA-seq reads to the reference genome, differential expression (DE) analysis and differential splicing (DS) analysis were applied on the estimated gene and exon expression values, using DEGseq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and DSGseq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] plus DEXseq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], respectively. Enrichment analysis on GO terms and KEGG pathways were applied on the obtained lists of DE genes and DS genes to get the overall picture of functions of the DE and DS genes. Protein domain analysis was applied on the DS exons of the kinase genes.

The gene KLK3 encodes the glyco-protein enzyme known as prostate-specific antigen (PSA), an important tumor marker used for diagnosis of prostate cancer in clinical practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. KLK3 is found to be both differentially expressed and spliced in the pathway. The gene HRAS was also found both differentially expressed and spliced. HRAS belongs to the Ras oncogene family, which encodes proteins functioning in signal transduction pathways. HRAS gene can produce two protein isoforms with complementary function related to cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The differential splicing of gene HRAS may suggest the roles of expression change at isoform level in prostate cancer. We noted that none of the kinases that can phosphorylate AR were differentially expressed, but four kinases, CDK5, CDK9, PIM1 and SRC were differentially spliced (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>).

We investigated that whether the 55 differentially spliced exons of DS kinases have functional impact on kinase activity by searching domains against Pfam database. We found 16 of the DS exons have domain hits in the Pfam domain database. Among them, 9 DS exons include the protein kinase domain (Pkinase). To verify if the functional relevance of DS exons of the 55 DS exons to the kinase domain was more significant than random chance of all alternative splicing kinase exons, we collected all known alternative splicing exons of 518 kinases from UCSC Genome Browser as background and searched them in the Pfam database. In total, 81 significant Pkinase domains were detected in 8671 peptide sequences translated from 1936 alternative splicing exons of the 518 kinases.

Isoform1 has full length of 293 amino acids and encodes protein CDK5 while Isoform2 lacks exon 6 and encodes a 260 amino acids protein. CDK5 is one of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family members and plays important roles in various cellular activities like cell differentiation and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The function of protein encoded by Isoform2 has not been well studied in the literature. Kim et al. reported different subcellular localizations of two isoforms of CDK5 which might indicate different functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. CDK5 knock-down by siRNA resulted in changes of the microtubule cytoskeleton, loss of cellular polarity and motility in human prostate cancer DU 145 cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. It has been reported that protein CDK5 can activate and stabilize AR in the nucleus through Ser-81 phosphorylation in prostate cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. These studies all suggested that CDK5 may be a potential regulator in prostate cancer progression through AR phosphorylation.</p><p id="Par26">Our study showed that CDK5 is differentially spliced between prostate cancer and benign tissues at exon 6 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). We found that although CDK5 was not detected as a DE gene at gene expression level, the relative isoform abundances in prostate cancer and benign tissues are very different. Isoform1 makes up more than 90% of the total expression of CDK5 in prostate cancer but less than 40% in benign tissues (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). AR shows higher expression in the prostate cancer group, with log2 fold change of ~&#x02009;1.43 comparing to the benign group. It has been reported that protein CDK5 encoded by Isoform1 can phosphorylate AR at its Ser-81 site and therefore activate and stabilize AR to promote prostate cancer cell growth in prostate cancer cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Since the kinase domain is missed in Isoform2, this function would be lost or weakened when Isoform2 is dominate in normal prostate tissues. We inferred that the higher relative expression of CDK5 Isoform1 in cancer cells can plays an important role in AR-involved prostate cancer progression.</p><p id="Par27">We validated the CDK5 isoform expression pattern in another RNA-Seq dataset of 21 prostate cancer and benign cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This dataset contains only five benign cell lines and the prostate cancer cell lines are of different subtypes. We observed that the benign cell lines still have lower Isoform1 expression (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>), although the isoform-switching between the prostate cancer and benign cell lines is statistically not significant. We found that isoform1 tends to be not expressed or lowly expressed in some prostate cancer cell lines like VCaP and LNCaP, which are androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell lines. We applied clustering analysis on the cell lines by their gene expression profiles, and clustered them into two groups: androgen-dependent cell lines and androgen-independent cell lines. We observed that CDK5 has different isoform usage between androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines. Isoform1 takes ~&#x02009;81% of total expression in the androgen-independent group and ~&#x02009;28% in the androgen-dependent group, and the proportions of Isoform2 are ~&#x02009;19% and ~&#x02009;72%, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). These different isoform preferences of CDK5 between androgen-independent or dependent prostate cancer cell lines implies that CDK5 can modulate AR transcriptional activity through differential splicing in accordance with the present or absent of androgen.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par28">In this study, we characterized the gene expression profile of prostate cancer by a systematic comparison of RNA-Seq data of prostate cancer and benign tissues. Quantitative analysis was applied on both the gene expression levels and their alternative isoforms, with a special emphasis on kinase genes. Results showed that alternative splicing adds another layer of regulation to gene expression by the different usage of splicing isoforms or their different relative expressions in cancer. Functional enrichment analysis also showed that the differentially expressed and spliced genes are enriched in GO terms and KEGG pathways that are closely related to prostate cancer. Some kinase genes that can phosphorylate AR are differentially spliced but none of them are differentially expressed. Differentially spliced exons of detected kinase genes are more enriched in the protein kinase domain than other alternative splicing exons. This indicates that the differentially spliced kinases have the potential to alter protein phosphorylation activity by changing abundance of isoforms with kinase domain.</p><p id="Par29">This conclusion was well illustrated by the observation that the AR phosphorylation kinase gene CDK5 undergoes isoform switching between prostate cancer and benign tissues. This result was confirmed on another RNA-Seq dataset of prostate cancer cell lines, on which isoform ratio differences were observed between androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines. We speculate that the isoform usage preference of CDK5 plays an important role in cancer cell growth by modulating AR transcriptional activity though AR phosphorylation and AR protein stabilization, as illustrated in the hypothetic model of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>.
