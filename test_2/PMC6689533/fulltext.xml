Among its subtypes, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common. Recently, the mitochondrial isoform of the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (HsPEPCK-M) was identified as responsible for the metabolic adaptation in the NSCLC allowing tumor growth even under conditions of glucose deficiency. This adaptation is possible due to the role of HsPEPCK-M in gluconeogenesis, converting the oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate in the presence of GTP, which plays an important role in the energetic support of these tumors. In this context, it was shown that the inhibition or knockdown of this enzyme was able to induce apoptosis in NSCLC under low glucose conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S2002"><title>Purpose</title><p>In this study, novel putative inhibitors were proposed for the human PEPCK-M (HsPEPCK-M) based on a computer-aided approach.</p></sec><sec id="S2003"><title>Methods</title><p>Comparative modeling was used to generate 3D models for HsPEPCK-M. Subsequently, the set of natural compounds of the ZINC database was screened against HsPEPCK-M models using structure-based pharmacophore modeling and molecular docking approaches. The selected compounds were evaluated according to its chemical diversity and clustered based on chemical similarity.</p></sec><sec id="S2004"><title>Results</title><p>The pharmacophore hypotheses, generated based on known PEPCK inhibitors, were able to select 7,124 candidate compounds. These compounds were submitted to molecular docking studies using three conformations of HsPEPCK-M generated by comparative modeling. The aim was to select compounds with high predicted binding affinity for at least one of the conformations of HsPEPCK-M. After molecular docking, 612 molecules were selected as potential inhibitors of HsPEPCK-M. These compounds were clustered according to their structural similarity. Chemical profiling and binding mode analyses of these compounds allowed the proposal of four promising compounds: ZINC01656421, ZINC895296, ZINC00895535 and ZINC02571340.</p></sec><sec id="S2005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>These compounds may be considered as potential candidates for HsPEPCK-M inhibitors and may also be used as lead compounds for the development of novel HsPEPCK-M inhibitors.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>lung cancer</kwd><kwd>PEPCK-M</kwd><kwd>virtual screening</kwd><kwd>pharmacophore modeling</kwd><kwd>molecular docking</kwd><kwd>natural products</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="3"/><ref-count count="55"/><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lung cancer is the most common of all malignant tumors and the primary cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide with more than 1.7 million deaths per year.<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the main type of lung cancer corresponding to approximately 85% of all cases. Despite the available treatments, a low survival rate is observed in most of the world&#x02019;s populations, averaging 10&#x02013;15%. This fact along with the high prevalence of this type of lung cancer highlight the need for the development of effective treatment strategies for NSCLC.<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>In general, although angiogenesis occurs in growing tumors, the process is highly disorganized resulting in substantial nutrient and oxygen deprivation.<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In these cases, the glucose concentration may be 3 to 10-fold lower in tumors than in normal tissues.<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> To circumvent this problem, it is described that lung cancer cells, in particular, NSCLC, use some steps of gluconeogenesis from sources such as glutamine and lactate to compensate the lack of glucose and overcome the metabolic stress.<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Recent studies have shown that the gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK; EC 4.1.1.32) plays an important role in the bioenergetic support of tumors.<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The enzyme PEPCK catalyzes the reversible conversion of oxaloacetate (OAA) + GTP to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) + GDP + CO<sub>2</sub> &#x02013; performing a major role in the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of glucose. This enzyme occurs in two isoforms in the human genome: PEPCK-C, the cytoplasmic isoform whose gene is located on chromosome 20; and PEPCK-M, the mitochondrial isoform whose gene is located on chromosome 14.<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Although there are studies exploring the expression of the enzyme PEPCK-C, the PEPCK-M isoform has not been extensively studied.<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In the literature, the expression of PEPCK-C is associated with differentiated liver, small intestine, kidney cortex, and adipose tissue.<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> PEPCK-M, in contrast, appears to be expressed in a variety of cell types, including T- and B-cells, pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells, and neurons.<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>In previous studies, it was observed a high PEPCK-M expression under low-glucose conditions in tumor tissues from NSCLC patients and very low expression of PEPCK-C.<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In this context, PEPCK-M was indicated as responsible for mediate metabolic adaptation, enabling biosynthesis of important metabolites and glucose-independent tumor growth.<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This adaptation process is possible through a re-wiring of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and early steps of gluconeogenesis by PEPCK-M. The substrate OAA &#x02013; supplied by glutamine or other anapleurotic substrates &#x02013; is metabolized in PEP, maintaining TCA cycle function and production of glycolytic intermediates for biosynthetic pathways required in tumor cell proliferation.<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The importance of PEPCK-M in the metabolism of NSCLC is corroborated by a study showing that inhibition by a known HsPEPCK-M inhibitor (3-mercaptopicolinic acid, MPA) or knockdown assays of this enzyme, under low glucose conditions, enhanced apoptosis and cell death in lung cancer cells (A549 and H23 cells).<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This same treatment, under the condition of high glucose concentration, did not have the effect of inducing apoptosis on A549 and H23 cells.<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> From this perspective, PEPCK-M is a promisor therapeutic drug target since its inhibition may interrupt the metabolic adaptation under glucose deprivation observed on NSCLC.</p><p>To date, there are no experimentally determined structures for the human mitochondrial isoform of PEPCK (HsPEPCK-M). However, structural studies were performed with other related PEPCKs, particularly human PEPCK-C (HsPEPCK-C) and <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> PEPCK-C (RnPEPCK-C). From these studies, it is known that the enzyme needs two divalent metal ions (usually manganese) to function properly &#x02013; these cations together with positively charged residues help to stabilize the reaction&#x02019;s intermediate enolate.<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Three regions show flexibility in PEPCK-C structures that are important to its function: (i) the 10-residue &#x003a9;-loop, (ii) P-loop, (iii) R-loop.<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The &#x003a9;-loop is a highly flexible region on the surface of the protein that functions as a cover for the active site. The P-loop, also called the kinase-1a domain, helps in positioning the nucleotide in the catalytic cleft.<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The R-loop is near to the OAA/PEP binding site and is important for stabilizing the closed &#x003a9;-loop lid.<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Besides the 3-mercaptopicolinic acid (MPA), which as previously mentioned can inhibit the enzyme PEPCK-M, there are no other inhibitors identified for the mitochondrial isoform.<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Nevertheless, experiments were performed to identify new inhibitors for PEPCK-C from different organisms though their effectiveness in inhibiting the PEPCK-M was not tested.<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Natural products have inherent characteristics that have been exploited classically in infectious diseases and cancers with success.<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Especially, natural compounds present complex frameworks that have evolved to exhibit protein binding motifs.<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This wide variety is not found in synthetic libraries: approximately 50% of the natural products in the Dictionary of Natural Products database do not have a synthetic equivalent.<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>The process of discovering new drugs is notoriously expensive.<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Computer-aided drug design (CADD) approaches can reduce the time and costs related to the development process for new medicines.<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Therefore, in the present work, CADD strategies were used to find new potential HsPEPCK-M inhibitors that could be used as alternatives for NSCLC treatment. The drug discovery approach is represented in <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Considering the promising anti-cancer therapeutic features of natural products, as high efficacy and low adverse effect compared to synthetic drugs,<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> we employed structure-based virtual screening approaches to screening the natural compounds subset from the ZINC database. To this end, we applied a pharmacophore modeling method using the available crystal PEPCK structures to recover, from the natural compounds&#x02019; subset, a library enriched with potential PEPCK inhibitors with new scaffolds. Next, we used comparative modeling to access the three conformations adopted by PEPCK-M active site during the catalysis. These modeled conformations and the enriched library were used in molecular docking assays. As the outcome, binding mode analysis and chemical diversity evaluation enabled the proposition of four novel potential PEPCK-M inhibitors.<fig id="F0001" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic overview of the computer-aided drug design approach used in the identification of HsPEPCK-M potential inhibitors.</p><p><bold>Abbreviations:</bold> u_HsPEPCK-M, modeled protein without ligands; GTP_HsPEPCK-M, modeled protein complexed with GTP and OAA; GDP_HsPEPCK-M, modeled protein complexed with GDP and PEP.</p></caption><graphic content-type="print-only" xlink:href="AABC-12-15-g0001"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>Template preparation and comparative modeling</title><p>Since there is no three-dimensional (3D) experimentally determined structure for the human PEPCK-M protein (HsPEPCK-M), models were constructed using comparative modeling techniques. The amino-acid sequence of HsPEPCK-M (UniProt code Q16822) was used to retrieve suitable template structures from the protein data bank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/">https://www.rcsb.org/</ext-link>). The selected structures were: (i) PDB ID 1KHG (resolution 2.34&#x000a0;&#x000c5;), represented HsPEPCK-C enzyme without substrates; (ii) PDB ID 1KHE (resolution 2.4&#x000a0;&#x000c5;) to represent HsPEPCK-C complexed with a GTP analogue; (iii) PDB ID 1KHF (resolution 2.02&#x000a0;&#x000c5;) to characterize HsPEPCK-C containing PEP substrate; and (iv) PDB ID 2FAH (resolution 2.09&#x000a0;&#x000c5;) to represent PEPCK-M enzyme of <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> complexed with GDP (GgPEPCK-M).<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>The final objective was to construct models considering the three conformations that the enzyme adopts with its substrates: (i) the unbound conformation (HsPEPCK-M), (ii) the enzyme bound to GTP + OAA (GTP_HsPEPCK-M), (iii) and the enzyme bound to GDP + PEP (GDP_HsPEPCK-M). It is important to note that 1KHF structure was determined complexed with PEP substrate but did not have the GDP substrate. To circumvent this problem, GDP molecule was added by superimposing the active site of 1KHF with the rat PEPCK-C complexed with PEP + GDP (PDB 4GMW). Then, similarly to what was done for 1KHF, we modified 1KHE (complexed with GTP) structure to add oxaloacetate (OAA) present in the rat PEPCK-C 2QF2 structure. The third structure, 1KHG, was maintained without substrates as determined experimentally.</p><p>The detailed analysis of the structures 1KHG, 1KHE and 1KHF revealed that these PDBs had incomplete regions &#x02013; with no 3D structure defined for the canonical amino acid sequence. The regions comprised: (i) nine N-terminal residues, (ii) T465-G472 portion and (iii) K547, A548. To solve this problem, we used the MODELLER 9.17 loop optimization with the loopmodel class followed by refinement with &#x0201c;refine.slow&#x0201d; option &#x02013; this was performed to complete the structures and optimize sidechains.<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Five structures were generated for each PDB, and the best result was selected using the DOPE score value.<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> These prepared structures were used as templates for the HsPEPCK-M models.</p><p>The model for HsPEPCK-M unbound conformation (u_HsPEPCK-M) was built using prepared HsPEPCK-C &#x02013; PDB ID 1KHG (sequence identity of 71% and 84% of similarity) and the GgPEPCK-M &#x02013; PDB ID 2FAH (sequence identity of 70% and 79% of similarity). The models generated to represent the conformations of HsPEPCK-M bound to GTP (GTP_HsPEPCK-M) and GDP (GDP_HsPEPCK-M) were built based on the HsPEPCK-C &#x02013; PDB ID 1KHE and HsPEPCK-C &#x02013; PDB ID 1KHF, respectively; and also based on GgPEPCK-M structure (PDB ID 2FAH) &#x02013; this structure was used since it presents all the loops ordered, without missing residues.</p><p>A hundred models were generated for each configuration (u_HsPEPCK-M, GTP_HsPEPCK-M, and GDP_HsPEPCK-M) using the automodel class of MODELLER 9.17.

The goal was to determine and select the pharmacophoric features essential for biological activity of ligands on HsPEPCKs. To this end, we used the crystal structure of HsPEPCK-C bound to PEP as reference and crystal structures of RnPEPCK-C complexed with inhibitors (with structures derived from PEP and OAA) to identify critical interactions. As a result, two pharmacophore hypotheses were achieved: PH1 and PH2 (<xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig"> B</xref>). PH1 included three pharmacophoric features: one negative ionizable center and two hydrogen-bond acceptors (<xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The feature representing a negative ionizable group was considered since the phosphate group of PEP, and its equivalents in the analyzed inhibitors (except for PDB ID 2RKE) had a negative charge that interacts with the two Mn<sup>2+</sup> and active site residues with a positive charge &#x02013; Arg87, Lys243, Lys244, and Arg405 (HsPEPCK-C numbering). The two hydrogen-bond acceptors, both corresponding to the carboxyl group of PEP, were selected due to the interaction already described with residues Gly237 and Asn403. These hydrogen-bond acceptors were also observed in the inhibitors present on 2RKA and 2RKE structures at precisely the same positions and on the inhibitor from 2RKD structure with a similar interaction with residue Gly237. The second hypothesis, PH2, was constructed with the pharmacophoric features already described for PH1 and two more features: one hydrogen-bond acceptor and a hydrophobic group as highlighted in <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>. These additional selections considered mainly the complementarity of features between HsPEPCK-C active site and PEP in the 1KHF structure: (i) hydrogen-bond interaction of PEP with the side chain of Arg405 and (ii) the hydrophobic region of PEP (highlighted in green) complementary with the hydrocarbon chain of Lys244 side chain.<fig id="F0004" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Structure-based pharmacophore hypothesis (PH).

</p><p>The analyses of scoring of these substrates and known inhibitors and their biding poses evaluation are important as a point of comparison for the virtual screening outcomes. In general, the detailed analysis of the binding mode of the substrates showed good agreement with that observed on template poses. From the dockings of PEP substrate on the three HsPEPCK-M models, the best pose was observed in GDP_PEPCK-M enzyme showing root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.356&#x000a0;&#x000c5; when compared to that pose in HsPEPCK-C (PDB ID 1KHF). The interaction pattern was also similar <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nc0rOyH0PbPyaCR6UQjm7j7DAfd73K-4?usp=sharing">Figure S5 A</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nc0rOyH0PbPyaCR6UQjm7j7DAfd73K-4?usp=sharing">B</ext-link>: (i) the phosphate group of PEP coordinates with manganese ion (Mn<sup>2+</sup>) while making a salt bridge with Arg423; (ii) oxygen from PEP&#x02019;s carboxylate makes a hydrogen bond with the amide backbone of Gly255 and Arg104. The substrate OAA, on the best pose using GTP_PEPCK-M, showed an RMSD of 1.796&#x000a0;&#x000c5; from the experimentally determined pose in the RnPEPCK-C (PDB ID 2QF2) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nc0rOyH0PbPyaCR6UQjm7j7DAfd73K-4?usp=sharing">Figure S5&#x000a0;C</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nc0rOyH0PbPyaCR6UQjm7j7DAfd73K-4?usp=sharing">D</ext-link>). It is important to note that the 2QF2 structure was not used directly as a template for a model generation &#x02013; the OAA substrate was added to the model by overlapping the structures in the comparative modeling step. Despite this, the docking pose preserved important interactions that are observed in the crystallographic pose: (i) similar to the interaction observed in PEP, OAA also interacts with the Mn<sup>2+</sup> through one of its carboxylate group; (ii) a salt bridge between Arg104 guanidine and the OAA carboxylate; (iii) OAA carboxylate also makes a salt bridge with Arg423 sidechain. However, the docked pose of OAA loses an important interaction between its carbonyl group and Mn<sup>2+</sup> &#x02013; it interacts instead with the guanidine group of Arg423.</p><p>Furthermore, 3-mercaptopicolinic acid (MPA) returned a docking score of &#x02212;10.750 in GTP_HsPEPCK-M, &#x02212;9.197 in the GDP_HsPEPCK-M and &#x02212;10.365 for u_HsPEPCK-M. The DS of MPA is an important positive control because it is known to inhibit HsPEPCK-M. The binding mode of MPA, determined in the structure of RnPEPCK-C (PDB ID 4YW9), showed interactions similar to the ones from the docking pose of GTP_HsPEPCK-M (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nc0rOyH0PbPyaCR6UQjm7j7DAfd73K-4?usp=sharing">Figure S5 E</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nc0rOyH0PbPyaCR6UQjm7j7DAfd73K-4?usp=sharing">F</ext-link>): (i) the carboxylate group of the ligand accepts a hydrogen bond from Arg104; (ii) Arg423 makes a pi-cation interaction with the pyridine ring of the ligand; (iii) the carboxylate group of the ligand coordinates with the Mn<sup>2+</sup>. In the docking pose, the orientation of the thiol group of MPA was inverted from the one in the crystallographic pose &#x02013; it is coordinating with Mn<sup>2+</sup>. In the experimental pose, the nitrogen of the pyridine ring has this role.</p><p>The docking score values of the known PEPCK-M inhibitor, 3-mercaptopicolinic acid, on the three HsPEPCK-M models were used as cut-offs to select the top-scored compounds from the three molecular docking virtual screenings. Therefore, the compounds with DS values equal or less than &#x02212;10.75, &#x02212;9.197 and &#x02212;10.581 on the dockings with GTP_HsPEPCK-M, GDP_HsPEPCK-M, and u_HsPEPCK-M, respectively, were considered as potential HsPEPCK-M inhibitors, since they present better DS values than 3-mercaptopicolinic acid. As an outcome, a total of 612 natural compounds were potentially able to inhibit at least one of the three conformations of HsPEPCK-M, of which 62 have the potential to inhibit all of them.</p><p>The chemical classification of these 612 potential inhibitors was achieved with a structure-based chemical taxonomy procedure performed with ClassyFire software.<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The superclasses and classes distributions of the chemical classifications are represented in <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">B</xref>, respectively. From these, organic acids and derivates, more specifically, carboxylic acids and derivates are the main superclass and class observed in the HsPEPCK-M potential inhibitors pool. Another significant superclass is the benzenoid category, with most of them being of benzene and substituted derivatives class. Additionally, fatty acyls, organooxygen compounds, phenylpropanoic acids, hydroxy acids and derivatives, phenols, pyridines and derivatives, organic phosphonic acids and derivatives are other classes with an expressive number of compounds. In contrast, most of the known PEPCK inhibitors (3-phosphonopropanoic acid, 2-phosphonoethylphosphonic acid, phosphonoformic acid, and phosphoglycolate) and substrates (phosphoenolpyruvate) are predominantly from the class organic phosphonic acids and derivatives. These analyses may indicate that most of the putative inhibitors have new chemical scaffolds when compared to the known inhibitors, as expected by a pharmacophore virtual screening approach.<fig id="F0005" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Chemical classification and distribution of compounds on classes based on ClassyFire software.

Therefore, it is sound to select representative compounds for more detailed evaluation steps. In these cases, grouping the set of compounds into clusters containing similar chemical structures and selecting representative compounds of each cluster is a common procedure. Considering this, the compounds retrieved from the molecular docking virtual screening step were hierarchically clustered based on their structural similarities measured by Tanimoto coefficient. As a result, a total of 13 clusters were obtained, as shown in dendrogram representation in <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>. The heat map, together with the dendrogram, allowed to evaluate the distribution of the DS values for all the three HsPEPCK-M modeled conformations. The representative compounds for each cluster are also depicted in <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, and the distribution of superclasses among the clusters are represented in <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>.<fig id="F0006" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Heat map and dendrogram for the clusters of the 779 potential HsPEPCK-M inhibitors.

In this cluster, benzenoids were the most frequent, followed by organoheterocyclic compounds, like pyridines and derivatives &#x02013; the same as observed in MPA, HsPEPCK-M known inhibitor. Phenylpropanoids and polyketides compounds were also observed in cluster 2 but were present in a higher number on cluster 3. Other groups with benzenoids compounds were the clusters 1 and 3. Lipids and lipid-like molecules were expressive on clusters 4 and 5. It is important to note, that all clusters presented compounds like carboxylic acids, organic phosphonic acids and derivatives, and peptidomimetics. This large distribution of compounds of these classes over all clusters reflects their structural diversity. The high number of organic acids, in general, is probably explained by two aspects: (i) the anionic feature selected by the pharmacophore hypotheses used on the screening of the initial set of natural compounds; (ii) and the electrostatic interactions of the negatively charged moieties of these compounds with the highly positive microenvironment in the HsPEPCK-M&#x02019;s active site (mostly with the manganese ion and the Arg423, Arg105 Lys262, and Lys261 residues), observed in molecular docking. This is important since this type of electrostatic interactions are also observed in the known PEPCK inhibitors as described before by Stiffin and collaborators.<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p></sec><sec id="S0003-S2006"><title>Molecular interaction analyses of the selected representative compounds</title><p>As a result of the virtual screening by docking with the three conformations, and from the clustering protocol, a set of four compounds presenting promising characteristics were selected for further analysis: (i) hydroxycitrate (ZINC01656421), (ii) tartaric acid (ZINC895296), (iii) danshensu (ZINC00895535) and (iv) 2-(2-Phenylhydrazono)malonic acid (ZINC02571340).</p><p>The compound hydroxycitrate (ZINC01656421), a tricarboxylic acid derivative representative of the cluster 4 (<xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), found in the list of best scored in the 3 conformations (DS &#x02212;14.62, &#x02212;11.699 and &#x02212;13.234 for GTP_HsPEPCK-M, GDP_HsPEPCK-M and u_HsPEPCK-M, respectively), was already studied in the literature for the treatment against cancer.<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> In this study, the authors found that a combination of hydroxycitrate, &#x003b1;-lipoic acid, and octreotide, when tested in NCI-H69 cells (small cell lung cancer model), had a &#x0201c;strong inhibitory effect on tumor development&#x0201d; being equivalent to treatment with cisplatin.<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> It was shown in the literature that hydroxycitrate is a strong inhibitor of ATP citrate lyase (EC 2.3.3.8).<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> ATP citrate lyase and PEPCK both have as substrates oxaloacetate and a triphosphate (GTP in the case of PEPCK).

This compound had the best docking score in the virtual screening with GDP_HsPEPCK-M (DS &#x02212;14.306), although had not good scores in the other two models (ie, GTP_HsPEPCK-M and u_HsPEPCK-M).

</p><p>The search for drugs against cancer must also consider the high chance of side effects on healthy tissues. Recently, advances in technologies such as aptamers &#x02013; synthetic oligonucleotides of RNA or single-strand DNA capable of binding with great specificity &#x02013; have the promise of directing the cytotoxic effect of inhibitors on cells with specific markers.<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> In the case of non-small cell lung cancer, aptamers could be bioconjugated with the putative inhibitors found here, reducing their possible side effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S0004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here we presented a computer-aided drug design approach for the HsPEPCK-M aiming the proposal of promising potential inhibitors for NSCLC on low-glucose conditions. Among the CADD procedures, a structure-based pharmacophore modeling was carried out with available PEPCK structures complexed with PEP or known inhibitors. Through a pharmacophore-based virtual screening, these constructed models made possible a selection of 7,124 natural compounds with key features for PEPCK inhibition. We also presented the first described comparative models of HsPEPCK-M representing the three theoretical conformations assumed during the catalysis. The comparative models were used on a second virtual screening selection based on molecular docking. As a result, a total of 612 natural compounds were predicted to inhibit at least one of the three HsPEPCK-M conformations, and 62 were expected to inhibit all of them. Between these HsPEPPCK-M potential inhibitors, the carboxylic acids and derivates were the most frequent. The success of these compounds can be attributed to the observed interactions of their negatively charged groups with the manganese ion and with important positively charged residues on HsPEPCK-M&#x02019;s active site. To select representative compounds for further binding mode analyses, all the retrieved compounds were hierarchically clustered based on structural similarities, resulting in 13 clusters. Four compounds from distinct clusters presented interesting new scaffolds and promising features: Hydroxycitrate (ZINC01656421), Tartaric acid (ZINC895296), Danshensu (ZINC00895535) and 2-(2-Phenylhydrazono)malonic acid (ZINC02571340). These compounds use key interactions observed in inhibitors already described for PEPCKs and have better docking scores values, indicating that they could potentially inhibit HsPEPCK-M and could act as new leads for further drug design studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are grateful to the Brazilian National Council of Research (CNPq) and the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) for supporting this work.</p></ack><sec id="S0005" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Disclosure</title><p>The authors' report grants from CNPq and CAPES, during the conduct of the study.
