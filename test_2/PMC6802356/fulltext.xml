Introduction</title><p>Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) have drawn substantial attention worldwide as wastewater treatment technology. MBRs outcompete other technologies because of several advantages, including smaller footprints, better effluent quality, and less sludge production. However, membrane biofouling, a critical obstacle, hindered the widespread use of the technology and remains to be overcome [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Membrane biofouling leads to lower permeate flux, higher energy consumption and cost, and it requires frequent membrane cleaning and replacement. To date, diverse anti-biofouling strategies have been reported, including the modification of membrane materials, the optimization of operating parameters, and the addition of chemicals [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Biofilm formation is known to be controlled and regulated by bacterial cell-to-cell communication via signal molecules called quorum sensing (QS). In recent years, quorum quenching (QQ, inhibition of cell-to-cell communication) has emerged as an innovative approach for biofouling control in an MBR [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. QQ alleviates biofilm formation by degrading or modifying QS signal molecules. This is because QQ is a valuable, low cost, and sustainable method, and it is a promising approach to hinder biofouling. </p><p>While activated sludge in MBRs consists of diverse microbiota, biofilm formation on the membrane is known to be regulated by QS [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Several microbial species in activated sludge have been reported to produce different types of signal molecules, including N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHL/AI-1) [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], autoinducer-2 (AI-2) [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Although there is broad interest to interrupt bacterial QS by QQ bacteria, limited attempts have been made to disclose the mechanism and influence of QQ bacteria on the microbial community inside bioreactors. Microbial community profiling by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene analysis may offer valuable information to determine the impact of QQ bacteria on the bacterial community structure and unveil the relationship between QS and QQ bacteria. In this study, QQ beads were prepared by immobilizing an indigenous QQ bacterium, <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> HG10, isolated from activated sludge, in sodium alginate beads. The QQ performance of the HG10 beads was then assessed in a batch bioreactor. Furthermore, microbial community analysis in both activated sludge and biofilm formed on the membrane in a batch bioreactor was conducted using high-throughput 16S rRNA barcoding and sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-ijerph-16-03777"><title>2.

Impact of QQ Beads for Alleviating Biofouling on Filter Membranes</title><p>A flat-sheet membrane was submerged in each conical flask (i.e., a batch reactor) to simulate biofilm formation and microbial community structure on the membrane surface in an MBR.</p><p>Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are considered key components for the structure of biofilms. The amount of EPS (carbohydrates and proteins) in the biofilm on the eighth day were measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f002">Figure 2</xref>). In the presence of HG10 beads, on the eighth day, the amount of total carbohydrates and total proteins decreased by 34% and 50%, respectively, compared with those in the presence of vacant beads. Accordingly, total EPS levels dropped by 43% when HG10 beads were added. EPS reduction came mainly from the overall decrease in protein. The production of EPS is regulated by QS and helps biofilm formation. <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> has been known for generating lactonase that can degrade AHL signal molecules [<xref rid="B31-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

Thus, HG10 beads attenuated biofilm formation by reducing EPS excretion.</p><p>Biofilms on the membrane surface in the batch bioreactors with and without beads were visualized on days 1 and 8 using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f003">Figure 3</xref>). For the control (i.e., with no beads) (CT) group and vacant beads (VB) groups, biofilms formed substantially on the membrane surface on day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f003">Figure 3</xref>&#x02014;CT1, VB1). In contrast, for the HG10 beads QQ (QQ) group, no biofilms were observed on day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f003">Figure 3</xref>&#x02014;QQ1), suggesting that the initial attachment of microbes on the membrane surface was completely prevented. After another 7 days of continuous incubation, severe biofouling was observed in both the VB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f003">Figure 3</xref>&#x02014;VB8) and CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f003">Figure 3</xref>&#x02014;CT8) groups. However, no obvious biofilms were observed for the QQ group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f003">Figure 3</xref>&#x02014;QQ8). Meanwhile, the COD in all three groups remained similar during the entire process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f004">Figure 4</xref>), indicating that the addition of HG10 beads did not influence wastewater treatment efficiency but biofilm formation.</p><p>In summary, HG10-entrapped QQ beads effectively prevented or delayed the maturation of biofilms, proving that the QQ bacteria have anti-biofouling abilities under the experimental conditions in this study.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f005">Figure 5</xref>, ternary plots are depicted for the top 10 OTUs categorized under the class level with the highest relative abundance (RA) in activated sludge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f005">Figure 5</xref>a) and biofilm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f005">Figure 5</xref>b), respectively. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f006">Figure 6</xref> shows RA plots depicted for the bacteria grouped by class taxonomic level with taxa abundance over 1% in activated sludge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f006">Figure 6</xref>a) and biofilm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f006">Figure 6</xref>b).</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f005">Figure 5</xref>a and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f006">Figure 6</xref>a, the microbial community structure in activated sludge with QQ beads was greatly divergent from those in activated sludge with vacant or control beads. In contrast, in the biofilms, no significant difference in the microbial community structure was observed between the three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f005">Figure 5</xref>b and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f006">Figure 6</xref>b). Taxonomic assignments at the class level for the top 10 OTUs with the highest relative abundance (RA) indicated that bacteria belonging to the class Gammaproteobacteria dominated the microbial community in activated sludge with QQ beads (A-QQ). Meanwhile, Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidia evenly dominated the microbial community in activated sludge with vacant beads (A-VB) and no beads (A-CT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f006">Figure 6</xref>a). However, the richness of Gammaproteobacteria in the A-QQ group was significantly higher than that of the controlled groups. Besides, more Bacilli and Verrucomicrobiae were observed in A-QQ group than A-VB and A-CT groups. </p><p>In addition, the composition and abundance of microbes changed with incubation time (1, 11, and 20 days) both in activated sludge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f006">Figure 6</xref>a) and in biofilm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f006">Figure 6</xref>b). The RA of Gammaproteobacteria was 87% and 85% on the first and 11th days, respectively, in activated sludge with QQ beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f006">Figure 6</xref>a), which were approximately 40% higher than those with vacant beads and no beads at the same time. The RA of <italic>Bacilli</italic> increased with time of incubation in activated sludge with QQ beads from 1.8% (day 1) to 38% (day 20). However, it remained almost constant in the other two groups (with an average of 0.2%). In contrast, certain classes of bacteria, including Bacteroidia, Clostridia, Deltaproteobacteria, and Campylobacteria, were diminished in activated sludge with QQ beads.</p><p>However, no similar fluctuations in the microbial community were observed among the biofilms in all three groups (B-QQ, B-VB, and B-CT), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f005">Figure 5</xref>b and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f006">Figure 6</xref>b. Although the total biofilm mass in biofilms with QQ beads was the least among the three groups, the microbial community structure in the biofilm was similar. The dominant phyla in biofilms for all three groups were Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, which is consistent with previous observations [<xref rid="B34-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. As expected, the microbial richness was lower in the biofilm on the membrane surface than on the activated sludge at the same incubation time in all three groups, but the microbial diversity in the biofilm increased over time, indicating that QQ inhibited biofilm formation rather than killing microorganisms.</p><p>The heatmaps drawn at the family level further illustrated a dissimilar composition and abundance of microbial structures between activated sludge with QQ beads and those in the other two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f007">Figure 7</xref>a). At the family taxonomic level, Aeromonadaceae, Burkholderiaceae, Rhizobiaceae, Moraxellaceae, and Pseudomonadaceae were noticeably fortified with the addition of QQ beads. Meanwhile, more than 20 bacterial taxa, including Desulfovibrionaceae and Nannocystaceae, were reduced by the QQ beads. In contrast, in the biofilms, a similar pattern of microbial community structure and richness was observed between the three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f007">Figure 7</xref>b).</p><p>To evaluate the difference in species complexity in both activated sludge and biofilms of the three groups, &#x003b2;-diversity (inter-sample diversity) was compared using Bray-Curtis distances. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f008">Figure 8</xref>). This analysis further indicated a clear disparity between activated sludge with QQ beads, vacant beads, and no beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f008">Figure 8</xref>a). No obvious separation was observed between the biofilm samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f008">Figure 8</xref>b). In addition, &#x003b1;-diversity analysis (intra-sample diversity) using the Shannon index revealed a decline of microbial community complexity in the activated sludge with QQ beads (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-03777">Table S1</xref>). &#x003b1;-Diversity analysis using the observed species and Chao1 index revealed a decrease in microbial community richness in activated sludge with QQ beads. Meanwhile, the analysis using the Simpson or dominance indices indicated a more even distribution of microbiota in activated sludge with QQ beads than that with no beads. LDA effect size (LEfSe) analysis was also conducted to reveal the biomarker of each group at different levels. The phylogenetic tree cladogram shows an overall biomarker species distribution and relative abundance of three parallel samples in the phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f009">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>To further uncover the difference in dominant species between different groups, the OTU representative sequence was analyzed with the relative abundance of the first 50 and annotated to the level of genus for the activated sludge in three groups (A-QQ, A-VB, and A-CT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03777-f010">Figure 10</xref>). At the genus level, several bacteria with the highest count number stood out. QQ beads dramatically improved the growth of <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>_OTU1, <italic>Aeromonas</italic>_OTU2, <italic>Delftia</italic>_OTU4, <italic>Bacillus</italic>_OTU5, and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>_OTU11 and hindered the growth of <italic>Macellibacteroides</italic>_OTU3, <italic>Niabella</italic>_OTU6 and OTU32, Christensenellaceae_R-7_group_OTU8, <italic>Ottowia</italic>_OTU75, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>_OTU10, <italic>Nannocystis</italic>_OTU17, <italic>Desulfovibrio</italic>_OTU25, <italic>Sedimentibacter</italic>_OTU15, <italic>Acetoanaerobium</italic>_OTU20, and Blvii28_wastewater-sludge_group_OTU14/OTU26.</p><p>It is noteworthy that OTU5 was successfully defined to the level of species as <italic>Bacillus cereus,</italic> which is the same bacterial species that was embedded into the beads. The highest count of this species in the control group (i.e., with no beads) was only 17, whereas in the QQ group (i.e., with QQ beads), the number reached up to 1523 on the 11th day. The count of <italic>Delftia</italic> also increased dramatically with QQ beads. Interestingly, several species of the <italic>Delftia</italic> genera have been reported as having AHL-degrading activity and can inhibit QS. Singh et al. demonstrated that <italic>Delftia tsuruhatensis</italic> attenuates biofilm formation of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Others have reported that <italic>Delftia</italic> sp. interferes with QS by producing AHL acylase and can use AHL as the sole carbon source [<xref rid="B36-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. <italic>Delftia acidovorans</italic> has been reported to inhibit QS by modifying C6- to C8-HSL [<xref rid="B37-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Concurrently, we also isolated <italic>Delftia tsuruhatensis</italic> strain NBRC 16741 and <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> HG10 from the same activated sludge sample. This strain also showed high AHL-degrading activity (data not shown). <italic>Aeromonas</italic>_OTU2 and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>_OTU11 were also successfully defined to the species level as <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> subsp. <italic>hydrophila</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas plecoglossicida</italic>, respectively. However, limited reports have been found about these two strains.</p><p>Among the genera that were downregulated, Blvii28_wastewater-sludge_group has been commonly found in wastewater or wastewater treatment systems [<xref rid="B38-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Researchers have indicated that this genus functions in the initial attachment during the biofilm forming process. In addition, the genus <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>_OTU10 was annotated to the level of species as <italic>Pseudomonas otitidis</italic>. This strain has been reported to have biofilm forming ability and has been applied to degrade oil in biofilm-based reactors [<xref rid="B40-ijerph-16-03777" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Although several studies have reported the effectiveness of QQ in biofouling control, limited information is available on the influence of QQ bacteria on microbial community composition, diversity, and richness. Here, we demonstrated a significant influence of QQ beads on the microbial community structure in activated sludge while reducing biofouling on the membrane surface. These results raised the possibility that QQ bacteria, by interfering with cell-cell communication between biofilm-forming bacteria, might trigger other native quorum-quenching bacteria to flourish in the community and initiate quorum quenching in a synergistic manner. However, the detailed synergism or antagonism relationship between those microbes and their detailed mechanisms are intriguing and remain to be elucidated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-ijerph-16-03777"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>Immobilized indigenous <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> effectively reduced biofouling on a membrane in a bioreactor. Remarkably, the bacterial community profiling data revealed a broad impact of QQ beads on the microbial distribution and abundance in activated sludge in a bioreactor. Clear separation of bacterial structure was observed at all genera and phyla taxonomic ranks. Certain OTUs clustered to the genus level, including <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, <italic>Aeromonas</italic>, <italic>Delftia</italic>, <italic>Bacillus</italic>, and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, were strikingly enriched by QQ beads in activated sludge. Meanwhile, more than 12 other OTUs in activated sludge were depleted. Whereas biofilm formation on membranes with QQ beads was delayed, microbial structure divergence in biofilms was not as dramatic as that observed in the activated sludge in the bioreactor. Our results provide new insight into how QQ bacteria battle biofilm-forming microbes while affecting the entire bacterial community. The mechanisms turned out to be more complex than expected. Our observation implies the possibility that embedded QQ bacteria could trigger certain native microbial taxa to flourish and inhibit biofouling in a synergistic manner by interfering with bacterial communication. Thus, it might provide helpful information for future QQ-MBR design.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="app1-ijerph-16-03777"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/19/3777/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/19/3777/s1</uri>, Table S1: &#x003b1;-Diversity index of activated sludge samples with QQ beads (A-QQ), vacant beads (A-VB), and control (A-CT) and biofilm samples on filter membrane with QQ beads (B-QQ), vacant beads (B-VB), and control (B-CT) on the first, 11th, and 20th day.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ijerph-16-03777-s001"><media xlink:href="ijerph-16-03777-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></app></app-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization and methodology, W.W. and C.H.L.; validation and data curation, C.Z.; formal analysis, F.X.; writing&#x02014;original draft preparation, review and editing F.X.; writing&#x02014;review and editing, F.X. and C.H.L.; supervision, Q.X.; funding acquisition, W.W. and F.X.</p></notes><notes><title>Funding</title><p>This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant No. 31500655; Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission under grant No. 20150623152519, JSGG20170822164024506, KJYY20171012103638606 and Shenzhen Municipal Government subsidies for postdoctoral research.</p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.
