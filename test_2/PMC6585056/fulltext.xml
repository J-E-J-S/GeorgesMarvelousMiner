An accumulation of mutations in several key pathways occurs during the transformation from normal colonic epithelium to a malignant carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Genes involved in these pathways such as <italic>APC</italic>, <italic>KRAS</italic>, and <italic>TP53</italic> represent a large fraction of the mutations prevalent in CRC. Notably, the <italic>KRAS</italic> oncogene is mutated in approximately 30% of CRC cases (cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These mutations generally lead to increased proliferation and survival via downstream activation of signaling through the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. KRAS signaling ultimately relays information to the intracellular transcriptional machinery via AP1 transcription factors, which dimerize and bind to the DNA upon phosphorylation, where they recruit further transcriptional regulators to modulate gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Followed by mutation of well-known tumor suppressor and oncogenes such as those listed above, the <italic>ARID1A</italic> gene is among the most frequently mutated genes in human CRC, where it is mutated in 10.9% of cases (TCGA PanCancer Atlas dataset, cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Interestingly, this frequency is even higher than mutational rates of several other bona fide tumor suppressor genes such as <italic>PTEN</italic> (6.4%) (cBioportal for Cancer Genomics) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. ARID1A is a subunit of the human BAF (BRG1-associated factors) complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], which is primarily involved in chromatin remodeling. Chromatin remodelers such as the BAF complex are large, multi-subunit complexes that utilize the energy of ATP hydrolysis to mobilize, slide, and evict nucleosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In vitro, four core subunits are required to dissociate nucleosomes from the DNA on a chromatin template. These include the mutually exclusive ATPases SMARCA2 or SMARCA4 (BRG1) and core subunits SMARCB1, SMARCC1, and SMARCC2 that enhance catalytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The exact role of the other BAF subunits is not very well understood, but mutation rates in cancer suggest important roles in vivo. As a regulator of chromatin structure and function, the BAF complex plays crucial roles in transcription and epigenetic modulation of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">The deregulation of epigenetic modulation has been well established as a common occurrence in cancer. However, the extent of its involvement in the development and progression of cancer was underscored by genome- and exome-wide sequencing studies which revealed a close association between the epigenome and the pathogenesis of cancer. Most significantly, subunits of the mammalian BAF complex show an alteration frequency in over 20% of all cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Among BAF complex subunits, <italic>ARID1A</italic> mutations are the most recurrent and widespread across many cancer types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These mutations often lead to a loss of ARID1A expression in tumors, and <italic>ARID1A</italic> has been extensively described as a tumor suppressor in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Consistently, the sporadic deletion of <italic>Arid1a</italic> in mice led to the formation of invasive adenocarcinomas in the colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">While the BAF complex has also been shown to play a role in DNA damage repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], its primary role appears to be in enhancer-mediated gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Enhancers are transcriptionally active, distal regulatory elements which modulate the expression of their target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. While initial studies reported that ARID1A occupied promoter regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], several studies have since shown that the BAF complex is targeted to enhancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In fact, the tumor suppressive functions of the BAF complex have been suggested to be primarily through its function in controlling enhancer-mediated gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In colorectal cancer, it was shown that the activity of BAF-occupied enhancers is reduced in <italic>ARID1A</italic>-deficient cells and accompanied by a loss of the active H3K27ac mark (acetylation of lysine 27 on histone 3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In this study, we sought to examine the transcriptional mechanisms underlying the tumor suppressor function of ARID1A in colorectal cancer. Surprisingly, we uncovered a previously unknown context-dependent function of ARID1A in promoting AP1 transcription factor activity downstream of KRAS signaling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>ARID1A protein loss is a frequent event in colorectal cancer</title><p id="Par9">To begin with, we examined the mutation frequency for <italic>ARID1A</italic> in colorectal cancer patients.

As shown in the representative images in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, the immunohistochemical staining for ARID1A was specific with normal rectal mucosa demonstrating positive ARID1A staining, whereas tumors were either strongly positive (++), weakly positive (+), or negative for ARID1A expression (negative). Overall, out of 164 patients, 81.7% retained ARID1A expression in their tumors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Consistent with the mutation rates, we observed a complete loss of ARID1A protein expression in 14.6% of the cases (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c) and 3.7% of patient tumors showed a weak staining pattern (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c).

For this purpose, we utilized a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing approach to delete a portion of the <italic>ARID1A</italic> gene in four colorectal cancer cell lines (COLO320DM, DLD1, HCT116, and HT29). These cell lines were specifically chosen because they expressed several BAF complex subunits to varying degrees (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1a) and also represent a varied mutational background representative of the diversity found in human CRC tumors. For example, HCT116 and DLD1 both contain <italic>KRAS</italic><sup>G13D</sup> mutations, whereas COLO320DM and HT29 are wild type for this gene. Similarly, all cell lines except HCT116 harbor mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> (cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]<italic>.</italic> The guide RNAs utilized specifically target two intronic regions flanking exon 5 of <italic>ARID1A</italic>, resulting in a frameshift of any potentially transcribed and spliced product from the mutant allele (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). We screened single cell clones of each cell line for deletion (KO) of <italic>ARID1A</italic> by genotyping PCR (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) and Western blot for protein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Genotyping PCR with primers targeting regions flanking the deleted exon revealed a product of 761&#x02009;bp in the knockout cells as compared to 1205-bp in the parental condition. The production of an out of frame product led to the complete loss of the protein from the cells, as can be seen for all four cell lines in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a.

To further investigate whether ARID1A may preferentially promote the expression of downstream KRAS target genes, we compared three <italic>KRAS</italic>-mutated cell lines (DLD1, HCT116, T84) to three wild-type counterparts (COLO320DM, HT29, RKO) using the Morpheus tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. We identified <italic>EREG</italic>, <italic>F3</italic>, and <italic>JAG1</italic> as potential candidates that were particularly highly expressed in the <italic>KRAS</italic>-mutated cell lines compared to cell lines harboring wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Notably, the three <italic>KRAS</italic>-mutated CRC cell lines all harbored activating mutations at residues G12 or G13. While not previously characterized as typical downstream MEK/ERK targets, each of these genes has potential interesting roles in the development of cancer. EREG (Epiregulin) is a ligand for EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) which signals through the MEK/ERK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. One study suggested that low EREG expression is associated with better overall survival in colorectal cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. <italic>F3</italic> (tissue factor III) encodes a glycoprotein receptor for coagulation factor VII and initiates blood coagulation, but has also been implicated in cancer metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. JAG1 (Jagged1) is a ligand for the Notch receptor, and high expression has been associated with poor prognosis in CRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. To test whether these genes are, in fact, targets of the MEK/ERK pathway, we inhibited the pathway by treating cells with the clinical MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib. Treatment with 20&#x02009;nM trametinib for 24&#x02009;h reduced the levels of phosphorylated ERK completely (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c), thus blocking the activation of downstream targets of this pathway. Consistent with their co-expression in <italic>KRAS</italic>-mutated CRC cell lines, <italic>EREG</italic>, <italic>F3</italic>, and <italic>JAG1</italic> were all downregulated following trametinib treatment, thereby confirming that they are, indeed, MEK/ERK target genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). Importantly, consistent with our GSEA analyses, all three investigated MEK/ERK target genes were also downregulated by the loss of ARID1A. Furthermore, consistent with ARID1A functioning epistatically downstream of the KRAS-dependent MEK/ERK signaling, trametinib did not substantially further reduce the expression of these genes in the absence of ARID1A expression. Therefore, our results suggest that ARID1A is required for maintaining the expression of cancer-relevant downstream targets of the MEK/ERK pathway in <italic>KRAS</italic>-mutated CRC cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>ARID1A is essential in <italic>KRAS</italic>-mutated colorectal cancer cells and controls the MEK/ERK pathway at the transcriptional level</title><p id="Par14">Based on our results above, indicating a positive role for ARID1A downstream of the MEK/ERK pathway, we reasoned that mutations of <italic>ARID1A</italic> and <italic>KRAS</italic> would not be compatible since a loss of ARID1A would impede the effects of hyperactive MEK/ERK signaling. Indeed, examination of the TCGA PanCancer Atlas colorectal adenocarcinoma cohort revealed that <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations were mutually exclusive with <italic>ARID1A</italic> mutations with only 16 out 526 patients harboring mutations in both genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1b). This mutual exclusivity was even more pronounced when the analysis was restricted to <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations in the codons for residues G12 and G13 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1b). Interestingly, the mutation rates of 17% for <italic>ARID1A</italic> are significantly higher in <italic>KRAS</italic>-wildtype tumors than in <italic>KRAS</italic>-G12/G13-mutated samples.

Therefore, in the context of <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations, ARID1A does not appear to function tumor suppressive, but rather facilitates the expression of genes particularly dependent on the MEK/ERK pathway.</p><p id="Par15">To further explore ARID1A function in the <italic>KRAS</italic>-mutant context, we investigated whether ARID1A loss directly regulated MEK/ERK pathway signaling activity by examining the levels of phosphorylated ERK (pERK) in wild-type and <italic>ARID1A</italic>-deficient HCT116 cells. However, loss of ARID1A expression did not result in decreased phosphorylation of ERK in either HCT116 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f) or DLD1 cells (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1c). Moreover, the expression of one of the most highly expressed AP1 factors, JUND, was also unaffected by <italic>ARID1A</italic> loss in either HCT116 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f) or DLD1 cells (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1c), suggesting that the observed perturbation of downstream MEK/ERK target genes was not due to altered expression of JUND. We therefore reasoned that ARID1A may control the transcriptional activation capacity of AP1 transcription factors and tested this hypothesis by performing GSEA using a set of genes associated with the AP1 transcription network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Consistent with our hypothesis, this gene set was specifically downregulated in <italic>ARID1A</italic>-deficient HCT116 and DLD1 cells in comparison with the parental cell lines (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>g). Thus, together, these findings suggest that ARID1A regulates target gene expression of the MEK/ERK pathway directly at the transcriptional level without appreciably affecting upstream signaling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>ARID1A localizes to AP1-bound enhancer regions</title><p id="Par16">We next sought to examine the direct roles of ARID1A in controlling transcription downstream of the MEK/ERK pathway by examining the genome-wide occupancy of ARID1A. To date, most conclusions about ARID1A function in transcription have been through indirect information based on SMARCA4 and SMARCC1 occupancy. Thus, in order to gain further direct, causal insights, we established chromatin immunoprecipitation for ARID1A utilizing a recently established dual crosslinking approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. This approach yielded good quality ChIP-seq data, enabling the direct examination of ARID1A occupancy. Bioinformatic analysis of these data confirmed a strong overlap with the BAF complex subunits SMARCA4 and SMARCC1 and co-occupancy with H3K27ac, which specifically marks active enhancer and promoter regions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Furthermore, consistent with recent literature demonstrating the importance of the BAF complex in enhancer-mediated regulation, the majority of ARID1A-enriched regions were distal (5 to &#x0003e;&#x02009;500&#x02009;kb) to the nearest transcriptional start site (TSS) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). To further examine ARID1A function at enhancer regions, we specifically identified active, ARID1A-bound regions which were enriched for H3K27ac and contained accessible chromatin regions (based on ATAC-seq) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). To specifically examine ARID1A function at enhancers, we further subtracted any regions that were annotated as transcriptional start sites, yielding 3,061 potential ARID1A-bound enhancer regions. Subsequently, we performed sequence-based motif analyses on these regions to identify enriched DNA-binding sequences indicative of specific transcription factor dependencies. Consistent with our hypothesis and previous studies examining BAF occupancy in other systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], we observed that ARID1A-bound enhancers are particularly enriched in AP1 binding motifs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). This finding was confirmed by comparing the ARID1A-bound regions with publicly available ChIP-seq data using the ReMap tool, where AP1 factors were among the top hits that co-localize with ARID1A (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e). Importantly, among the overlapping factors were FOSL1 and JUND, which are among the most highly expressed AP1 factors in HCT116 cells. We confirmed these findings using ChIP-seq data for FOSL1 and JUND occupancy in HCT116 cells, where we observed a strong co-occupancy of FOSL1 and JUND at the 3,061 ARID1A-bound enhancer regions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f). Motif analysis and ReMap-based transcription factor occupancy for all ARID1A binding sites are shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2a, b. Thus, in conclusion, global ChIP-seq analysis revealed that ARID1A co-localizes with AP1 factors, thereby supporting a potential direct role of ARID1A in directing AP1-dependent enhancer-mediated gene regulation downstream of the MEK/ERK pathway.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>ARID1A is localized to AP1-occupied enhancers.

Using this approach, we identified 6,741 genes associated with the 3,061 potential enhancers. Further overlap of these genes with those downregulated following <italic>ARID1A</italic> deletion in HCT116 cells yielded 317 potential direct enhancer targets, including several interesting cancer-relevant genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Interestingly, the <italic>EREG</italic>, <italic>F3</italic>, and <italic>JAG1</italic> genes, which we had identified as being highly dependent on the MEK/ERK pathway, were also identified as ARID1A-bound enhancer targets. Consistently, as shown before, these genes were downregulated by the knockout of <italic>ARID1A</italic> in both <italic>KRAS</italic>-mutated cell lines HCT116 and DLD1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). The ChIP-seq tracks shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c confirm that the ARID1A-occupied enhancer regions on all three genes were also occupied by the AP1 transcription factor JUND and marked by H3K27ac. Importantly, these potential enhancer-promoter pairs are located within the same topologically associated domain (TAD) as assessed by Hi-C, making their interaction more probable. Moreover, PRO-seq (precision run on sequencing) data revealed nascent RNA transcription from these sites, suggesting that eRNAs might be transcribed from these enhancers. These enhancers were also accessible as assessed by ATAC-seq. Contrary to the prevailing view that ARID1A is essential for the maintenance of open chromatin, the loss of ARID1A did not lead to a decrease in accessibility at ARID1A-bound enhancers in HCT116 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2c). While this is surprising, another recent study also reported no reduction of accessibility at enhancers upon the loss of ARID1A in RMG1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Nevertheless, there is a striking loss of H3K27ac from these enhancers, which could partially explain the loss of target gene expression. We confirmed the H3K27ac reduction by ChIP-qPCR at these enhancers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d) and also observed a similar reduction at all ARID1A-bound enhancers (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). Thus, our results show that the loss of ARID1A leads to the reduction of activity of enhancers and target gene expression at regions co-occupied by AP1 transcription factors.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>The loss of ARID1A leads to a loss of enhancer activity.

Moreover, consistent with our model, treatment with trametinib also resulted in reduced occupancy of ARID1A and H3K27ac at these enhancers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b, c). Thus, inhibition of AP1 transcription factor activity by blocking the upstream MEK/ERK pathway effectively leads to reduced ARID1A recruitment and decreased histone acetylation at ARID1A/AP1-bound enhancers, leading to decreased target gene expression.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>The attenuation of the MEK/ERK pathway leads to a loss of enhancer activity at ARID1A-bound enhancers.

In summary, we show that the loss of ARID1A has context-dependent functions in colorectal cancer. Mathur et al. describe that in a wild-type background, the loss of ARID1A is tumor suppressive and leads to the formation of invasive adenocarcinomas. This function is mediated through control of enhancer activity wherein there is a loss of the active H3K27ac mark upon the loss of ARID1A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We show that in colorectal cancer cells which harbor <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations, ARID1A has a tumor-supporting function by facilitating transcription at enhancers downstream of the MEK/ERK pathway also partially through the placement of the H3K27ac mark (<bold>d</bold>). In the first case, synthetic lethal targets described in the literature may provide potential therapeutic targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].

As described in the previous sections, subunits of the BAF complex are among the most frequently mutated genes in cancer and are extensively described as tumor suppressors. In this study, we explored the role of ARID1A in transcriptional control of gene expression in colorectal cancer cells. We found that cell lines containing activating <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations are particularly dependent on ARID1A. In the absence of ARID1A, the proliferation of these cells is severely impaired, suggesting a tumor-supporting function in this context. Furthermore, we confirmed that ARID1A itself is, indeed, mainly localized at enhancers in colorectal cancer cells where it acts as a co-factor at regions bound by AP1 transcription factors, which act downstream of the MEK/ERK pathway. Consistently, we further showed that the attenuation of the MEK/ERK pathway leads to a disruption of this transcriptional network at enhancers as both ARID1A and H3K27ac are lost from these sites. This is accompanied by a downregulation in the expression of the associated target genes.</p><p id="Par20">At the molecular level, ARID1A acts as a cofactor at sites occupied by AP1 transcription factors. Consistent with our findings, a direct interaction between ARID1A and FOS AP1 factors was previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Our work suggests that this interaction is especially relevant in <italic>KRAS</italic>-mutated colorectal cancers, where an attenuation of the MEK/ERK pathway mimics the effects of ARID1A loss in these cells. Surprisingly, the primary function of ARID1A at these regions does not appear to be dependent upon the ability of the BAF complex to remodel chromatin since its loss had no effect on chromatin accessibility. This may be partially explained by other BAF complexes containing orthologues of ARID1A which may enable chromatin remodeling function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], but not be sufficient for enhancer activation, or due to the binding of other transcription factors that help maintain chromatin in an accessible conformation. Instead, the ARID1A-containing BAF complexes appear to facilitate the assembly of a larger coactivator complex essential for the activation of enhancers (for instance, through recruitment of a histone acetyltransferase-containing complex). This effect is consistent with what has been reported in <italic>Smarcb1-</italic>deleted mouse embryonic fibroblasts, where H3K27ac is also globally lost from enhancers. Re-expression of <italic>Smarcb1</italic> in that system restored H3K27ac, p300, BRD4, and Mediator binding in the chromatin fraction, supporting that enhancer activity could be restored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In addition to its requirement for the placement of H3K27ac, as a large multi-subunit complex, ARID1A might also facilitate enhancer activity by promoting chromatin looping between the promoter and enhancer. As a complex with many subunits, it appears likely that BAF may play a role in the aggregation of cofactors at enhancers, thereby forming locally active transcriptional hubs.</p><p id="Par21">Under the notion that <italic>ARID1A</italic> is a tumor suppressor, several research groups sought to model <italic>Arid1a</italic>-deficient cancer in mice. While these models confirmed its tumor suppressive role in various cancers, some striking observations were made which indicated that ARID1A could also play a pro-tumorigenic role in certain contexts. For example, in ovarian epithelial cancer (OEC), while <italic>Pten/Apc</italic> deletion led to the formation of poorly differentiated OECs in mice, the additional deletion of <italic>Arid1a</italic> caused tumor cells to have a less aggressive, more differentiated epithelial phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Similarly, deletion of <italic>Arid1a</italic> from otherwise wild-type mice protects against DEN (diethylnitrosamine)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while overexpression of <italic>Arid1a</italic> accelerated tumor initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In a pancreatic cancer model, <italic>Arid1a</italic> was shown to have very context-dependent roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In colorectal cancer, the deletion of <italic>Arid1a</italic> in the background of <italic>Apc</italic> inactivation (which hyperactivates the Wnt pathway) blocked tumor formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Similarly, deletion of the BAF component <italic>Smarca4</italic> also attenuated Wnt-dependent tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Interestingly, we also observed a strong co-localization of ARID1A with the downstream effector of the Wnt pathway, TCF7L2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> a), which could explain the cooperation between these factors at the transcriptional level. Thus, the consequences of ARID1A loss in cancer appear to be particularly context-dependent. We show that, in the background of <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation, the loss of ARID1A has an inhibitory effect on proliferation. This finding is further confirmed by the fact that mutations in <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>ARID1A</italic> are largely mutually exclusive in colorectal cancer patients. In future studies, it will be very interesting to decipher at which time point during transformation cancer cells lose ARID1A expression. In colorectal cancer, it appears that loss of ARID1A in wild-type backgrounds may promote early tumorigenesis while loss of ARID1A in the background of mutations in <italic>APC</italic> or <italic>KRAS</italic> may inhibit tumor progression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d).</p><p id="Par22">Overall, these findings indicate that the context in which <italic>ARID1A</italic> loss occurs likely determines whether it plays a primarily tumor suppressive or tumor promoting role. Several BAF complex subunits have been described as tumor suppressors in different contexts, making it difficult to use them as direct therapeutic targets. Therefore, several studies have successfully sought to identify synthetic lethal therapeutic targets and identified vulnerabilities that can, at least in principle, be targeted using small molecule inhibitors. While these have shown some promise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], it has become increasingly clear that the context of the tumor must be considered carefully before applying these therapies to ARID1A-deficient cancers. In the case of oncogenic functions, such as in synovial sarcoma or in colorectal cancer as described here, directly targeting the BAF complex could be an option. This could possibly be mediated using PROTACS (Proteolysis Targeting Chimera), which lead to targeted degradation of a cellular protein. Consistently, a PROTAC targeting the BRD9 subunit of the BAF complex has already shown promise in models of synovial sarcoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Thus, the development of additional PROTACs mediating the degradation of the BAF complex may provide new therapeutic approaches for <italic>KRAS-</italic>mutated colorectal cancer. This would enable a precision oncology approach for the therapy of a relevant fraction of colorectal cancers based on robust molecular mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par23">Taken together, our work significantly expands the knowledge about the context-dependent functions of ARID1A in cancer. We identified that ARID1A is essential in specific contexts of colorectal cancers and was able to show mechanistically that <italic>KRAS-</italic>mutated colorectal cancer cells are especially dependent on the presence of ARID1A. In cells containing <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations, the loss of ARID1A led to decreased activity of enhancers bound by ARID1A and the AP1 transcription factors, and deregulation of target gene expression. This effect was accompanied by impaired proliferation of these cells. Moreover, we also showed that ARID1A has roles beyond its chromatin remodeling activity and can serve as a transcriptional cofactor to promote histone acetylation. This work builds upon and expands existing knowledge about the interplay of ARID1A and AP1 transcription factors by showing its relevance in the development of a subset of colorectal cancers. We also suggest the possibility of the BAF complex being a targetable entity in these cancers. Further exploration of this concept might provide additional important insights into the mechanisms by which ARID1A-containing BAF complexes regulate enhancers and serve as a knowledge base that can be exploited for therapeutic benefit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Patient data and immunohistochemistry</title><p id="Par24">These experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the local ethics committee and with the requisite informed consent from all patients.
