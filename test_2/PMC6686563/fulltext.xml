Distinguishing actual instances of AIS from stroke mimics is critical for the triage process in emergency medicine. In addition to providing a method for corroborating diagnosis of AIS, stroke biomarkers have the potential to serve as predictors of stroke severity and clinical outcomes when the abundance of a particular gene product has a significant association with patient outcome measures. Biomarker discovery can also provide additional insight into the basic physiology and molecular biology surrounding AIS and similar infarctions, including apoptosis of brain cells, by identifying genes in key regulatory pathways.</p><p id="Par45">Several recent studies have identified molecular AIS biomarkers from blood samples. Among the biomarkers considered are the standard metabolites assayed in hospital labs, mRNA expression array, RNASeq data, miRNA data, and mass spectroscopy proteomic data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. One of the molecular markers most strongly associated with AIS is the tetracicopeptide repeat protein <italic>TTC7B</italic>, which is responsible for localizing the P14K kinase in the plasma membrane. Mutations in <italic>TTC7B</italic> have been found to be associated with stroke risk, and the gene appears to be downregulated in stroke patients in comparison to control samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Similarly, miRNA panel assays found higher blood <italic>let-73-5p</italic> levels associated with downregulation of <italic>CASP3</italic> and <italic>NLK</italic> in AIS patients compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">The conventional approach taken in most of these studies is to compare gene expression levels (or metabolite densities) between an experimental and control group of samples, which in this context means samples taken from stroke patients vs. non-stroke patients. Gene expression comparisons are made by computing the log fold change (FC) in relative transcript densities between stroke and non-stroke in order to determine the extent to which a gene&#x02019;s level of expression is up or down-regulated between (for instance) stroke vs. non-stroke cases.</p><p id="Par47">While simple and efficient, such approaches suffer from several drawbacks. Among these is the fact that even with <italic>p</italic>-value corrections for multiple comparisons, the number of candidate significant genes remains too high to be of practical value as biomarkers. Furthermore, the genes identified from FC often have no functional relationship with one another, nor do comparisons of gene expression levels identify associations among genes in common pathways. As a result, even if some transcriptomic analyses of stroke patients seem promising and were validated with additional qPCR experiments (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which identified <italic>TTC7B</italic>), the results were not reproducible in further studies and thus their predictive performance for the diagnosis of stroke is limited.</p><p id="Par48">Due to the limitations in the analyses of expression data that are based solely on FC differences, a number of recent studies, e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] have applied machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines, discriminant analysis, and k-nearest neighbour (KNN) clustering to identify more statistically robust set of genetic predictors that can consistently distinguish stroke from non-stroke cases. The present study uses such methods in combination with gene expression network models as a novel approach to stroke biomarker discovery. Analyses of gene expression data make increasing use of network-based approaches that identify covarying transcription patterns among genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Several algorithms have been used to construct gene networks from co-expression data: usually graph edges between pairs of genes are identified from their expression covariances or mutual Shannon-Weaver information measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The significance of a gene within the network can be quantified in terms of its topological relationship to the other genes &#x02013; potentially indicating that a gene plays a key regulatory role in an expression pathway. Such network significance metrics are functions of the degree (number of edges) of each node and the weighted degrees of some neighborhood set. Specifically, the &#x0201c;centrality&#x0201d; of a node, computed from its own degree and a weighted count of its neighbors&#x02019; (defined up to some Hamming distance) determines its topological importance in a network. A number of network measures can be used to quantify the functional importance of genes in an interaction network, including eigenvector centrality and Page centrality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">There has been limited application of network centrality measures to the identification ofg stroke biomarkers. One such study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] used network models and PageRank centrality to identify significant miRNA-mRNA interactions in animal models of AIS and validated the significant mRNAs by fold change comparisons of human gene expression levels in stroke vs. control patients. In this study, we analyse gene expression data from the blood samples of AIS patients and control groups to construct gene expression network models. The functional importance of genes will be determined by their network centrality, the differences in gene centrality between stroke and control samples will be used to identify stroke biomarkers using machine learning approaches. The efficacy of this network-based method will be compared to the traditional approaches based on the magnitude of difference (FC) in transcript abundance between stroke and control samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Datasets</title><p id="Par50">The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) was queried to obtain expression profile data in blood samples taken from stroke patients. The transcriptomics data for both AIS and control (non-stroke) samples were obtained from published stroke gene expression studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. All of these data were from microarray experiments (Affymetrix whole-genome expression arrays U133 2.0) on peripheral blood samples from stroke patients and from control non-stroke patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Data integration</title><p id="Par51">Analysis of the pooled data requires integration of the different expression array datasets from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] into a single expression matrix with a consistent scaling of the expression levels. Dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] consists of 20 stroke and control peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] has 39 stroke and 25 control whole blood samples, while [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] also has whole blood for 23 stroke and control samples. Because the three datasets were generated via different instrumentation and experimental setup, they were separately and differently normalized in their initial format. Therefore, we also initially re-normalized each data set separately using robust multi-array averaging (RMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]) and log transformation of the data. We note that the stroke samples in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] were evaluated at three time points (within 3&#x02009;h, 5, and 24&#x02009;h of the stroke event); only the 3&#x02009;h time point data were used for this study.</p><p id="Par52">Additionally, pooling data from different studies meant combining expression arrays derived from whole blood samples vs. those from PBMC. Because PBMC excludes non-nucleate cells, one may expect somewhat different mRNA profiles with respect to whole blood due to differences in cell/tissue type. Consequently, it was necessary to determine whether pooling PBMC and whole blood data may introduce artifacts due to mRNA profile differences between the different types of blood samples. This was achieved by comparing the FC per-gene in the whole blood only datasets to the pooled blood/PBMC data using Spearman rank-based correlation analyses.</p><p id="Par53">The data sets were merged by performing a second layer of joint normalization similar to the standard approaches used for qPCR data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Initially, we selected 8 commonly used housekeeping genes (<italic>ACTB, B2M, HMBS, HPRT1, RPL13A, SDHA, TBA, YWHAZ</italic>) that were expressed at comparable mean levels in both treatment (stroke) and control groups and followed the procedures outlined in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] to identify the minimal subset of genes that show the most among-experiment variability to use as normalizers. Because all of these genes showed relatively high FC across samples (Log<sub>2</sub>FC prior to median per-sample normalization was &#x0003e;&#x02009;0.3 for all the examined housekeeping genes), normalization was performed based on median per-sample expression level rather than rescaling with respect to expression levels of housekeeping genes.</p><p id="Par54">The pooled data were filtered so that only genes with less than 10% missing expression values would be retained for further analysis. For the remaining missing values, the KNN-Impute method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] was applied to properly impute the missing data with K&#x02009;=&#x02009;20. For the final stage of quality control, outliers were identified with a method based on principal components analysis (PCA) &#x02013; retaining the principal components that accounted for 90% of covariation, and then applying the local outlier factor (LOF) approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] to cluster samples and detect outliers as the unclustered samples. This analysis indicated that less than 5% of the data were marked as outliers, thereby passing a predefined threshold of fewer than 10% outliers for a dataset to be considered valid for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Analysis of differential expression</title><p id="Par55">Analyses of differential expression (fold-change in gene expression levels between stroke and non-stroke samples) were performed using InSyBio&#x02019;s implementation of limma (linear model for microarray) using the Ebayes algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] to evaluate linear model fit considering the sample type (PBMC/whole blood) as a covariate. Moderated t-statistics (t-scores where the standard errors are reduced to a common value across probes) were used to determine the <italic>p</italic>-values associated with the log fold-change (log FC), i.e. log<sub>2</sub>[X<sub>S</sub>/X<sub>C</sub>], where X<sub>S</sub> and X<sub>C</sub>, are, respectively, the mean gene expression levels in the stroke and control samples. The Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] was performed to adjust the p-values for multiple comparison. Statistically significant log FC values were defined as those with FDR-adjusted <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 of the moderated t-statistic.</p><p id="Par56">Differences in instrumentation across samples were considered a potential source of bias, and was removed by specifying this variation as a covariate in the Ebayes algorithm to account for heterogeneity between the combined expression arrays. Genes with statistically significant log FC values between stroke and control samples are retained as input for prediction models. The prediction models developed from this gene set were used for comparison with prediction models using gene sets derived from the network-based methods of identifying significant genes, as outlined below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Network-based biomarker characterization</title><p id="Par57">In order to identify biomarkers that are both statistically and potentially functionally significant, the InSyBio Bionets network-based approach was applied to the expression data.

For example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] identified a set of 29 genes that provided 93.5% sensitivity and 89.5% specificity in distinguishing control vs. stroke, while [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] used expression levels from a panel of 10 genes to achieve 95.6% predictive accuracy. None of the 29 genes in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] are in our set of 6 network central genes, while of the 10 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], <italic>ID3</italic> is the only shared gene.</p><p id="Par88">The predictive accuracies in these studies vs. our results are not directly comparable, insofar as we use a different (merged) dataset for model building. Nevertheless, the regression analyses summarized in S1 indicate that differences in gene expression level between whole blood and PBMC are sufficiently similar to make at least qualitative comparisons of predictive accuracies across these sample types and combinations thereof. To further address the contraints of comparison across sample types, the prediction model suggested in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] was retrained using the dataset of the current study and evaluated using the same cross validation setup used for the evaluation of the network-central gene models. When gene sets identified in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] are used as model predictors with the merged training data, our network-based models perform favorably in comparison.</p><p id="Par89">Another potentially significant caveat to the current study is the fact that due to limited data, the examined predictive models and biosignatures used only cross-validation analysis, as opposed to an independent external dataset for validation. As additional gene expression data in stroke patients become available, the prediction model based on network-central gene biosignatures should be subjected to further external validation with additional, independent data.</p><p id="Par90">Apart from potentially achieving similar levels of predictive accuracy with a smaller array of genes, the principal advantage of the network-based approach lies in providing greater information content through the identification of genes with co-expression patterns correlated with those in the prediction model, i.e. the d&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, 2 network neighbors. Network models leverage joint information about pairwise co-expression patterns, and so can provide additional insights into the functions and pathways of genes underlying a disease or condition. Such statistical associations generate hypotheses for future experimental confirmation of the significance of the identified network-central predictor genes and their neighbors to stroke physiology, and consequently, their potential to serve as biomarkers in clinical assays.</p><p id="Par91">There are a number of possible biological explanations for the observed changes in network connectivity and gene centrality between stroke and control samples. The identification of 6 network-central genes whose expression levels are strongly characteristic of acute ischemic stroke is thought to be a consequence of specific, correlated patterns of gene expression linked to stroke and associated reactions to anoxia, inflammation, and cell death in both the brain and in blood vessels. Such correlated patterns of gene activity are particularly evident in the increased number of interactions (or at least statistically significant associations) between control and stroke for <italic>NOG, BMX, SFXN2</italic> and <italic>SLC22A12</italic> vs. the decrease in association with <italic>ID3</italic> and <italic>MBTPS1,</italic> as evidenced by the relative sizes of d&#x02009;=&#x02009;1 neighborhoods.</p><p id="Par92">While differential gene expression is necessary for the identification of gene centrality in a network, it is not necessarily the case that the most strongly dysregulated genes are associated with the overall biological changes driven by a particular disease or condition. The fact that none of the genes with the strongest differences in network centrality (with the exception of <italic>ID3</italic>) are characterized by with largest FC further illustrates the efficacy and power of network-based approaches to the analysis of gene expression. It is also noteworthy that significantly differentially expressed genes from independent studies such as <italic>TTC7B</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] were not found to be significant in the integrated dataset, either in the analyses of log FC differences or in the network models. This could indicate that the significant FC observed for this gene in individual studies are due to particular characteristics of that experimental design, or due to the gene expression outcomes specific to the therapy/drug treatments received by a specific cohort of patients.</p><p id="Par93">A large difference in centrality score between stroke vs. non-stroke samples may be indicative of gene regulatory pathways that are disrupted (either differentially activated or repressed) during a stroke even in the absence of large changes in the expression levels of individual genes. For example, the existence of less highly connected neighborhoods associated with specific genes may provide insight into gene expression &#x0201c;modules&#x0201d; associated with specific pathways. This modularity is disrupted during stroke events (and potentially other pathological states) through the up or down-regulation of genes that link the once functionally and statistically separated pathways.</p><p id="Par94">As a potential limitation to these interpretations, it is noted that some of the changes in mRNA density associated with stroke may be a &#x0201c;passive&#x0201d; result of cell death rather than due to stroke-specific changes in gene expression patterns. The genes associated with these mRNAs are less likely to be part of regulatory or signalling cascades unique to stroke, and as such of limited interest as possible therapeutic targets. This aspect is particularly relevant in the case of circulating miRNAs. miRNA/mRNA interactions occur in the cytoplasm, so changes in the concentrations of circulating miRNAs may be the result of differential expression of miRNA in cells that die and lyse.</p><p id="Par95">Similar considerations apply to the differences in mRNA densities that are a consequence of changes in relative leukocyte densities rather than differential expression. Several recent papers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] have shown that the density of lymphoid cells in whole blood decreases following stroke, while the relative abundance of neutrophils and other myeloid cells increases. Consequently, at least part of the changes to mRNA densities in whole blood reflect changes in relative leukocyte abundance rather than changes in transcription patterns as such.</p><p id="Par96">Notably, the 10 genes used as stroke predictors in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] are differentially expressed between myeloid and lymphoid leukocytes, so that the change in relative cell count explains most of the observed variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Among these genes is <italic>ID3</italic>, which is also a predictor gene in the present study. However, whether differential expression vs. changes in leukocyte densities account for differential abundance of mRNA in the remaining 5 predictor genes and those in their network neighbors remains an open question. GO analyses of genes in the neighborhoods of the network-central predictors (and the predictor genes themselves, apart from <italic>ID3</italic>) do not indicate enrichment with respect to immune function or differentiation of blood cells. Furthermore, <italic>ID3</italic> is the only gene in the set of 6 which has among the highest differences in mRNA abundance between stroke and control, so it is possible that the patterns seen for the remaining 5 genes and their network neighbors are not being driven by the same processes as those leading to differential mRNA densities in <italic>ID3</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par97">The results of this study suggest a number of possible directions for future research. To further validate the applicability of the significant genes as biomarkers, it would be of value to repeat the analyses with a control set of stroke mimics (i.e. samples from non-AIS patients who exhibit stroke-like symptoms) rather than the healthy controls obtained from the GEO public data sets. Beyond the specific applicability of these results to distinguishing stroke from non-stroke, we can further refine our classification of clinical phenotypes according to patient outcomes (e.g. based on NIH Stroke Scale or Rankin scores) and associating these with characteristic gene expression patterns. This would allow us to identify biomarkers predictive of patient outcomes and perhaps eligibility for therapeutic interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>
