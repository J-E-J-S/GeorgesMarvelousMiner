id="ABS1"><p id="P10">Benchmark small variant calls are required for developing, optimizing and assessing the performance of sequencing and bioinformatics methods. Here, as part of the Genome in a Bottle Consortium (GIAB), we apply a reproducible, cloud-based pipeline to integrate multiple short and linked read sequencing datasets and provide benchmark calls for human genomes. We generate benchmark calls for one previously analyzed GIAB sample, as well as six broadly-consented genomes from the Personal Genome Project. These new genomes have broad, open consent, making this a &#x02018;first of its kind&#x02019; resource that is available to the community for multiple downstream applications. We produce 17% more benchmark SNVs, 176% more indels, and 12% larger benchmark regions than previously published GIAB benchmarks. We demonstrate this benchmark reliably identifies errors in existing callsets and highlight challenges in interpreting performance metrics when using benchmarks that are not perfect or comprehensive. Finally, we identify strengths and weaknesses of callsets by stratifying performance according to variant type and genome context.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P11">Genome sequencing is increasingly used in clinical applications, making variant calling accuracy of paramount importance. With this in mind, the Genome in a Bottle Consortium (GIAB) developed benchmark small variants for the pilot GIAB genome.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> These benchmark calls have been used for optimization and analytical validation of clinical sequencing,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> comparisons of bioinformatics tools,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and optimization, development, and demonstration of new technologies.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p id="P12">Here, we build on previous GIAB integration methods to enable the development of highly accurate and reproducible benchmark genotype calls from any genome, using multiple datasets from different sequencing methods (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). We first generate more comprehensive and accurate integrated SNV, small indel, and homozygous reference calls for HG001&#x02014;the same sample used in the original GIAB analysis. These calls were made more accurate and comprehensive by using new and higher-coverage short and linked read datasets,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> technology-optimized variant calling methods, and more robust methods to decide when to trust a variant call or homozygous reference region from each technology. Calls supported by two technologies were used to train a model that identified calls from each dataset that were outliers and therefore less trustworthy. Variant calls and regions were included in the benchmark set if at least one input callset was trustworthy and all trustworthy callsets agreed. We compare our callsets to the phased pedigree-based callsets from the Illumina Platinum Genomes Project<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> (PGP) and Cleary <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, following best practices established by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health Benchmarking Team,<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and manually examine the differences to evaluate the accuracy of our callsets.</p><p id="P13">We apply this approach to six broadly consented GIAB genomes from the Personal Genome Project (PGP),<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> an Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) mother-father-son trio and a Han Chinese mother-father-son trio. We also use our methods to form similar benchmark sets with respect to the human GRCh38 reference.</p><p id="P14">We demonstrate that our benchmark sets reliably identify false positive and false negative variant calls in a variety of high-quality variant callsets, including alternative benchmark sets like Platinum Genomes. The benchmark sets can be used to identify strengths and weaknesses of different methods. Finally, we discuss how strengths and weaknesses of the benchmark sets themselves can bias the resulting performance metrics, particularly for difficult variant types and genome contexts.</p><p id="P15">In contrast to existing benchmarking efforts, the extensively characterized PGP genomes analyzed here have an open, broad consent and broadly available data and cell lines, as well as consent to re-contact for additional types of samples.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> They are an enduring resource uniquely suitable for diverse research and commercial applications. In addition to homogeneous DNA from NIST Reference Materials and DNA and cell lines from Coriell, a variety of products using these genomes is already available, including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), cell line mixtures, cell line DNA with synthetic DNA spike-ins with mutations of clinical interest, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cells, and circulating tumor DNA mimics.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p id="P16">Previous studies have used more restricted samples to characterize variants and regions complementary to our benchmark sets: for example, the Platinum Genomes pedigree analysis,<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> HuRef analysis using Sanger sequencing,<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> integration of multiple SV calling methods on HS1011,<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and synthetic diploid using long-read sequencing of hydatiform moles<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. The recent synthetic diploid method<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> has the advantage that long read assemblies of each haploid cell line have orthogonal error profiles to the diploid short and linked read-based methods used in this manuscript, though short reads were used to correct indel errors in the long read assemblies. However the synthetic diploid hydatiform mole cell lines are not available in a public repository.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The broadly consented and available GIAB samples from PGP have at least three strengths relative to the other samples: (1) we can continue to sequence these renewable cell lines with new technologies and improve our benchmark set over time, (2) any clinical or research laboratory can sequence these samples with their own method and compare their results to our benchmark set, and (3) a wide array of secondary reference samples can be generated from the same cell lines to meet particular community needs.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Design of benchmark calls and regions</title><p id="P17">Our goal is to design a <italic>reproducible, robust, and flexible</italic> method to produce a benchmark <italic>variant</italic> and <italic>genotype</italic> callset (including homozygous reference regions).

We develop a modular, cloud-based data integration pipeline, enabling diverse data types to be integrated for each genome. We produce benchmark variant calls and regions by integrating methods and technologies that have different strengths and limitations, using evidence of potential bias to arbitrate when methods have differing results (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Finally, we evaluate the utility of the benchmark variants and regions by comparing high-quality callsets to the benchmark calls and manually curating discordant calls to ensure most are errors in the other high-quality callsets.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>New benchmark sets are more comprehensive and accurate</title><p id="P18">The new integration method is designed to give more accurate and comprehensive benchmark sets in several ways, which are detailed at the end of the Online Methods: (1) we use newer input data, including 10x Genomics linked reads, and most data were measured from the homogeneous NIST RM batches of DNA; (2) some long homopolymers and difficult-to-map regions are now in the benchmark sets by using PCR-free Illumina GATK gVCF outputs and 10x Genomics LongRanger, respectively; (3) we use a more accurate set of potential structural variants to exclude regions with problematic small variant calls; and (4) we add phasing information. <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the evolution of the GIAB/NIST benchmark sets since our previous publication.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The fraction of non-N bases in the GRCh37 reference covered has increased from 77.4% to 90.8%, and the numbers of benchmark SNVs and indels have increased by 17% and 176%, respectively. The fraction of GRCh37 RefSeq coding regions covered has increased from 73.9% to 89.9%. The gains in benchmark regions and calls are a result of using new datasets and a more accurate and less conservative structural variant (SV) bed file (Online Methods), as well as a new approach where excluded difficult regions are callset-specific depending on read length, error profiles, and analysis methods. GRCh38 is currently characterized less comprehensively characterized than GRCh37 (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>, and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). To determine if less input data could be used, we also integrated only two datasets (Illumina and 10x), resulting in a larger number of benchmark indel calls but a five times higher error rate compared to v3.3.2 (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 2</xref>). Our callsets are now mostly phased using pedigree or trio analysis, but we did not evaluate the accuracy of this phasing (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>High Concordance with Illumina Platinum Genomes</title><p id="P19">The bottom section of <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows increasing concordance over multiple versions of our HG001 callset with the Illumina Platinum Genomes 2016-v1.0 callset (PG).<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> PG provides orthogonal confirmation of our calls, since the PG phased pedigree analysis may identify different biases from our method. PG contains a larger number of benchmark variant calls, even relative to our newest v3.3.2 calls for HG001. However, when comparing v3.3.2 to PG within both benchmark regions, we found that the majority of differences were places where v3.3.2 was correct and PG had a partial complex or compound heterozygous call (e.g., <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), or where the PG benchmark region partially overlapped with a true deletion that v3.3.2 called correctly. To reduce the number of these inaccurate calls in PG, we contracted each of the PG benchmark regions by 50bp on each side, which is similar to how we remove 50bp on each side of uncertain variants (e.g., locus (1) in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). Because PG has many more uncertain variants, contracting the PG benchmark regions by 50bp reduces the number of variants in the PG benchmark region by 32%, but it also eliminates 93% of the differences between v3.3.2 and PG in GRCh37, so that 61 PG-only and 47 v3.3.2-only calls remain in both benchmark regions.</p><p id="P20">After manually curating the remaining 108 differences between v3.3.2 and PG in GRCh37, v3.3.2 has 5 clear FNs, 1 clear FP, 2 unclear potential FNs, and 6 unclear potential FPs in the NIST benchmark regions (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data 1</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 4</xref>). Based on 3529641 variants concordant between NIST and PG, there would be about 2 FPs and 2 FNs per million true variants. Since these are only in the PG benchmark regions, these error rates are likely lower than the overall error rates, which are difficult to estimate.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Trio Mendelian inheritance analysis</title><p id="P21">Benchmark callsets were generated for two PGP trios, an Ashkenazi Jewish and Han Chinese trio (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). As orthogonal benchmark callsets are not available for these genomes a trio Mendelian inheritance analysis was used to evaluate the callsets. The trio analysis allows us to phase some variants in the sons (see below) and determine variants that have a genotype pattern inconsistent with Mendelian inheritance. We separately analyzed Mendelian inconsistent variants that were potential cell-line or germline de novo mutations (i.e., the son was heterozygous and both parents were homozygous reference), and those that had any other Mendelian inconsistent pattern (which are unlikely to have a biological origin). Out of 2038 Mendelian violations in the Ashkenazi son, 1110 SNVs and 213 indels were potential de novo mutations. Out of 425 Mendelian violations in the Chinese son, 103 SNVs and 43 indels were potential de novo mutations. The large difference between the trios may arise from differences in the datasets used to generate the benchmark callsets or mutations arising in the EBV-immortalization process. The number of <italic>de novo</italic> SNVs is about 10% higher than the 1001 <italic>de novo</italic> SNVs found by 1000 Genomes for NA12878/HG001, and higher than the 669 <italic>de novo</italic> SNVs they found for NA19240.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Upon manual inspection of 10 random de novo SNVs from each trio, 17/20 appeared to be true de novo. Upon manual inspection of 10 random de novo indels from each trio, 10/20 appeared to be true de novo indels (most in homopolymers or tandem repeats), and the remainder were correctly called in the sons but missed in one of the parents. <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data 1</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 5</xref> contain additional details about manual curation of each site and Mendelian concordance.</p><p id="P22">Based on the Mendelian analyses, there may be as many as 16 SNV and 150 indel errors per million variants in one or more of the 3 individuals before excluding these sites. Note that we exclude the errors found by the Mendelian analysis from our final benchmark bed files, but it is likely that the error modality that caused these Mendelian errors also caused other errors that were not found to be Mendelian inconsistent. Many other error modalities can be Mendelian consistent (e.g., systematic errors that cause all genomes in the pedigree to be heterozygous, and systematic errors that cause the wrong allele to be called), so these error estimates should be interpreted with caution.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Performance metrics vary when comparing to different benchmark callsets</title><p id="P23">We next explore how performance metrics can differ when using different benchmark sets. When comparing a method&#x02019;s callset against these imperfect and incomplete benchmark callsets, Estimates of a method&#x02019;s precision and recall/sensitivity computed from imperfect and incomplete benchmark callsets may differ from the true precision and recall of the method for all regions of the genome and all types of variants. Insufficient examples of variants of particular types can result in estimates of precision and recall with high uncertainties. In addition, estimates of precision and recall can be biased by the following: (1) errors in the benchmark callset, (2) use of methods that do not compare differing representations of complex variants, and (3) biases in the benchmark towards easier variants and genome contexts. We demonstrate that these biases are particularly apparent for some challenging variant types and genome contexts by benchmarking a standard bwa-GATK callset against three benchmark sets: GIABv2.18 from our previous publication,<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> GIABv3.3.2 from this publication, and Platinum Genomes 2016-1.0 (PG).<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p id="P24">We examine 3 striking examples in coding regions, complex variants, and decoy-associated regions: (1) The bwa-GATK SNV FN rate is 62 times higher when benchmarking against PG vs. against GIAB, and 2/10 manually curated FNs vs. PG appeared to be errors in PG. (2) The bwa-GATK putative FP rate for compound heterozygous indels was only slightly lower for PG vs. GIAB, but upon manual curation 6/10 putative FPs were actually errors in PG whereas only 1/10 putative FPs was an error in GIAB. (3) The 1000 Genomes developed the hs37d5 decoy sequence to remove FPs in some regions with segmental duplications not in GRCh37.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The precision for bwa-GATK-nodecoy is 67% vs. GIABv3.3.2, whereas it is 91% vs. GIABv2.18 and 93% vs. PG. The much higher precision vs v2.18 or PG is a result of many of the decoy-associated variants being excluded from the benchmark regions of GIABv2.18 and PG. Assessing these variants is important because they make up 7123 of the 16452 FPs (43%) vs. GIABv3.3.2 for this callset. We also found notable differences between benchmarks for large indels (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data 1</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 6</xref>). Subtle differences between performance metrics for different GIAB genomes (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 7</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Since characteristics of the benchmark can affect performance metrics, we have outlined known limitations of our benchmark set (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 8</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Orthogonal &#x0201c;validation&#x0201d; of benchmark set</title><p id="P25">We have chosen to present detailed results of expert manual curation of multiple short, linked, and long read sequencing alignments in place of the more traditional targeted Sanger sequencing method for &#x0201c;validation&#x0201d;. There are several reasons that confirming some discrepancies by Sanger sequencing is unlikely to add more confidence: (1) We already have multiple technologies supporting many of the calls in our truth set; (2) In our manual curation, we visualized PacBio and moleculo sequencing data, which have longer reads (or pseudo-reads) than Sanger sequencing and were not used to form our truth sets; (3) All 23 of the calls we classified as &#x0201c;Incorrect or partial call by PG at or near a true variant&#x0201d; are in homopolymers or tandem repeats, and 20 of them are heterozygous or compound heterozygous indels that Sanger could not help resolve; (4) We classified 18 SNVs as &#x0201c;Calls that are in PG and appear likely to be FPs despite inheriting properly, either due to a local duplication or a systematic sequencing error that occurs on only one haplotype&#x0201d; (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). These regions are unlikely to be easily characterized by Sanger sequencing, and longer reads from PacBio and Moleculo sequencing are more useful orthogonal &#x0201c;validation&#x0201d;. (5) Even when using a single short read sequencing technology, previous work found that discrepancies between Sanger sequencing and their variant calls were mostly errors in Sanger sequencing.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> (6) For 32 of the 47 variants found only in v3.3.2, the RTG phased pedigree calls had an identical call to v3.3.2 even though RTG&#x02019;s Illumina-only pedigree methods are much more similar to PG&#x02019;s pedigree methods. For these reasons, we have focused our efforts on expert manual curation of multiple whole genome sequencing technologies rather than performing targeted Sanger sequencing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">Trustworthy benchmarks reliably identify errors in the results of any method being comparted to the benchmark. To demonstrate we meet this goal, we show that when using our benchmark calls with best practices for benchmarking established by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 9</xref>),<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> the majority of putative FPs and FNs are errors in the callset being benchmarked. This is a moving target, since new methods are continually being developed that may perform better, particularly in challenging regions of the genome.</p><p id="P27">We form our benchmark callsets to accurately represent genomic variation in regions where we are confident in our technical and analytical performance. A notable limitation in such callsets is that they will tend to exclude more difficult types of variation and regions of the genome. When new methods with different characteristics than those use to form our callsets are applied, they may be more accurate in our regions difficult to access with our methods, and less accurate in regions where we are quite confident. For example, as graph-based variant calling methods are developed, they may be able to make much better calls in regions with many ALT haplotypes like the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) even if they have lower accuracy within our benchmark regions.

For each callset, we find sites that fall outside the cut-offs or that are already filtered, and we generate a bed file that contains the call with 50bp added to either side to account for different representations of complex variants.

(a) The arbitration process has two cycles. The first cycle ignores &#x0201c;Filtered Outliers&#x0201d;. Calls that are supported by at least 2 technologies in the first cycle are used to train a model that identifies variants from each callset with any annotation value that is an &#x0201c;outlier&#x0201d; compared to these 2-technology calls. In the second cycle, the outlier variants and surrounding 50bp are excluded from the callable regions for that callset. (b) For each variant calling method, we delineate callable regions by subtracting regions around filtered/outlier variants as at locus (1), regions with low coverage or mapping quality (MQ) as at locus (2), and &#x0201c;difficult regions&#x0201d; prone to systematic miscalling or missing variants for the particular method as at locus (3). For callsets in gVCF format, we exclude homozygous reference regions and variants with genotype quality (GQ) &#x0003c; 60. Difficult regions include different categories of tandem repeats (TR) and segmental duplications. (c) Four arbitration examples with two arbitrary input methods. (1) Both methods have the same genotype and variant and it is in their callable regions, so the variant and region are included in the benchmark set. (2) Method 1 calls a heterozygous variant and Method 2 implies homozygous reference, and it is in both methods&#x02019; callable regions, so the discordant variant is not included in the benchmark calls and 50bp on each side is excluded from the benchmark regions. (3) The methods have discordant genotypes, but the site is only inside Method 2&#x02019;s callable regions, so the heterozygous genotype from Method 2 is trusted and is included in the benchmark regions. (4) The two methods&#x02019; calls are identical, but they are outside both methods&#x02019; callable regions, so the site is excluded from benchmark variants and regions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms-1522204-f0001"/></fig><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2:</label><caption><p id="P143">Complex variant discordant between GIAB and Illumina Platinum Genomes.
