Various genomic tools have been developed using the diverse activities of DNA/RNA ligases. Herein, we demonstrate a non-conventional ability of T4 DNA ligase to insert 5&#x02032; phosphorylated blunt-end double-stranded DNA to DNA breaks at 3&#x02032;-recessive ends, gaps, or nicks to form a Y-shaped 3&#x02032;-branch structure. Therefore, this base pairing-independent ligation is termed 3&#x02032;-branch ligation (3&#x02032;BL). In an extensive study of optimal ligation conditions, the presence of 10% PEG-8000 in the ligation buffer significantly increased ligation efficiency to more than 80%. Ligation efficiency was slightly varied between different donor and acceptor sequences. More interestingly, we discovered that T4 DNA ligase efficiently ligated DNA to the 3&#x02032;-recessed end of RNA, not to that of DNA, in a DNA/RNA hybrid, suggesting a ternary complex formation preference of T4 DNA ligase. These novel properties of T4 DNA ligase can be utilized as a broad molecular technique in many important genomic applications, such as 3&#x02032;-end labelling by adding a universal sequence; directional tagmentation for NGS library construction that achieve theoretical 100% template usage; and targeted RNA NGS libraries with mitigated structure-based bias and adapter dimer problems.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>novel ligation</kwd><kwd>T4 DNA ligase</kwd><kwd>NGS</kwd><kwd>molecular tool</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Shenzhen Peacock Plan</named-content></funding-source><award-id>KQTD20150330171505310</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>1.

Some unusual catalytic properties of this ligase were reported previously, such as sealing single-stranded gaps in duplex DNA, sealing nicks adjacent to abasic sites in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), promoting intramolecular loop formation with partially double-stranded DNA, and joining DNA strands containing 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold> branch extensions.<xref rid="dsy037-B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup><sup>&#x02013;12</sup></xref> Researchers also observed template-independent ligation mediated by T4 ligase, such as mis-paired nick sealing in dsDNA<xref rid="dsy037-B13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> or even single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ligation, albeit at very low efficiency.<xref rid="dsy037-B14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> These results suggest that perfect complementary base pairing at or adjacent to the ligation junction is not critically needed for some unconventional T4 DNA ligase activities. T4 RNA ligases 1 and 2 are the products of genes 63 and 24, respectively, of T4 phage. Both require an adjacent 5<bold>&#x02032;</bold>PO<sub>4</sub> and 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>OH end for a successful ligation with the concurrent hydrolysis of ATP to AMP and PPi. The substrates for T4 RNA ligase 1 include single-stranded RNA and DNA, whereas T4 RNA ligase 2 preferentially seals nicks on dsRNA rather than ligating the ends of ssRNA.<xref rid="dsy037-B15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dsy037-B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p><p>Here, we demonstrate a non-conventional end-joining event mediated by T4 DNA ligase that we call 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>-branch ligation (3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL). This method can join DNA or DNA/RNA fragments at nicks, single-stranded gaps, or 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>-recessive ends to form a branch structure. This report includes extensive study of a wide variety of ligation cofactors and activators and the optimization of the ligation conditions for this type of novel ligation. With our 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL protocol, no base pairing was required, and the ligation can reach 70&#x02013;90% completion in most cases, including for a 1-nt gap. One application of this method is the attachment of adapters to DNA or RNA during NGS library preparation. Several genomic structures that were previously considered unligatable can now be used as substrates for 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL, resulting in a high conversion rate of input DNA into adapter-ligated molecules while avoiding chimeras. We demonstrate that 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL can be coupled with transposon tagmentation to increase library yield. The directional tagmentation strategy we propose will theoretically produce templates 100% of which can be utilized for sequencing. Our study demonstrated the value of this novel technique for NGS library preparation and the potential to advance many other molecular applications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials"><title>2.

Both processes can be catalysed by bacteriophage T4 DNA ligase, which uses ATP as an energy-yielding cofactor and requires Mg<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>.<xref rid="dsy037-B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> T4 DNA ligase was also reported to ligate specific or degenerate single-stranded oligos to partially single-stranded substrates through hybridization.<xref rid="dsy037-B17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dsy037-B18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Here, we demonstrated a non-conventional T4 DNA ligase-mediated ligation that does not require complimentary base pairing and can ligate a blunt-end DNA donor to the 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>OH end of a duplex DNA acceptor at 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>-recessed strands, gaps, or nicks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F1">Fig. 1</xref>a). Therefore, we use the term 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>-branch ligation (3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL) to describe these ligations. The synthetic donor DNA we used contained a 5<bold>&#x02032;</bold> blunt duplex end and a 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold> ssDNA end. The acceptor substrates contained one of the following structures: a dephosphorylated nick, a 1- or 8-nt gap, or a 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold> 36-nt 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>-recessed end (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). T4 ligase helps to join the 5<bold>&#x02032;</bold>PO<sub>4</sub> of the donor strand to the sole ligatable 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>OH of the acceptor strand to form a branch-shaped ligation product.</p><p>To optimize the ligation efficiency, we extensively tested a number of factors that affect general ligation efficiency, including the adapter: DNA substrate ratio, T4 ligase quantity, final ATP concentration, Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration, pH, incubation time, and different additives, such as polyethyleneglycol-8000 (PEG-8000) and single-stranded binding protein (SSB) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>, data not shown). Adding PEG-8000 to a final concentration of 10% substantially increased the ligation efficiency by 2- to 10-fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). A large range of ATP concentrations (from 1 &#x000b5;M to 1 mM in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>a) and Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (3&#x02013;10 mM, data not shown) were compatible with the 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL. The ligase quantity needed for 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL was comparable with that for blunt-end ligation. In our optimized conditions, we used donor: substrate DNA molar ratios of 30&#x02013;100, and we performed the reactions at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h at pH 7.8 with 1 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10% PEG-8000. The ligation of the same donors to blunt-end substrates and ligase-free reactions were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The ligation donor (Ad-G) is double-stranded on one end (5<bold>&#x02032;</bold> phosphorylated and 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold> dideoxy protected) and single-stranded (3<bold>&#x02032;</bold> dideoxy protected) on the other end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F1">Fig. 1</xref>a, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The ligation substrates are composed of the same bottom strand (ON1) with different top strands to compose nick, gap, and overhang structures. To quantify ligation product yields, the reaction products were separated on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F1">Fig. 1</xref>b). Ligation efficiency was calculated as the ratio of product to substrate intensity using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F1">Fig. 1</xref>b and c). The experiments were repeated multiple times with very similar ligation efficiency (data not shown). The 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>-recessive ligation (lane 11 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F1">Fig. 1</xref>b) appeared &#x0223c;90% complete, which is even higher than the blunt-end ligation control (lane 14, 72.74%) and suggests remarkably high ligation efficiency with 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>-recessive DNA ends. The 1- or 8-nt gap substrates (lanes 5 and 8) showed good ligation efficiency of &#x0223c;45%. Nick ligation (lane 2) efficiency was the lowest at &#x0223c;13%. However, this ligation yield was improved when the nick ligation reaction was incubated longer (data not shown), suggesting slower kinetics for the nick ligation reaction.</p><p>We also extended our study to different adapter and substrate sequences using the optimized reaction condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The 5<bold>&#x02032;</bold>PO<sub>4</sub> ends of three different adapters (Ad-T, Ad-A, or Ad-GA in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) contained either a single T or A or the dinucleotide GA at the ligation junction before a consensus CTGCTGA sequence. These 5<bold>&#x02032;</bold>PO<sub>4</sub> ends were individually ligated to the 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>OH ends of acceptor templates with a T at the ligation junction. Overall, high ligation efficiency (70&#x02013;90%) was seen in most cases except for nick ligations or 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL using Ad-GA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F2">Fig. 2</xref>f), thus indicating some nucleotide preference of T4 DNA ligase at the ligation junctions. Independent of the adapter and substrate sequences, the 3&#x02032;-recessive end or gap ligations always showed better efficiencies (60&#x02013;90%), whereas the nick ligation was fairly inefficient, in a 1-h incubation. We hypothesize that these discrepancies in ligation efficiency are due to the DNA bending where the nick/gap/overhang starts and exposes the 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>OH group for ligation. The longer ssDNA region likely makes the 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold> termini more accessible in the ligation and results in higher ligation efficiency. We also tested whether a similar end-joining event could occur as 5<bold>&#x02032;</bold> branch ligation. In contrast to 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL, no obvious ligation of a blunt-end adapter to the 5<bold>&#x02032;</bold>PO<sub>4</sub> end at the gap or the 5<bold>&#x02032;</bold>-recessive end was observed (data not shown). This result suggests greater steric hindrance of T4 DNA ligase at the donor&#x02019;s 5<bold>&#x02032;</bold> termini compared with 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold> termini.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3.2"><title>3.2. 3&#x02032; Branch ligation to ligate DNA to RNA</title><p>We further investigated 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL on DNA/RNA hybrids (ON-21/ON-23 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) that form one DNA and one RNA 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>-recessive end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F3">Fig. 3</xref>a). Ligation on DNA/DNA hybrids served as a positive control, whereas negative ligation controls included DNA/RNA hybrids, ssDNA, or ssRNA oligos incubated individually or with adapters (lanes 3, 4, and 5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F3">Fig. 3</xref>c and data not shown). Interestingly, when DNA/RNA hybrids were incubated with a blunt-end dsDNA donor, we observed a size change of the RNA oligo from the original 29&#x02013;49 nt upon ligation. However, the DNA substrate remained unchanged (lanes 1 and 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F3">Fig. 3</xref>c). This result suggests that the blunt-end dsDNA donor ligated to the 3&#x02032;-end of RNA but not to the 3&#x02032;-end of DNA. As a positive control, DNA/DNA hybrids with 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>-recessive ends on each side showed band shifts to larger species on both strands with nearly 100% efficiency (data not shown). To confirm that the 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>-recessive structure was needed for 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL, we performed the same ligation reaction while replacing the original DNA oligo (ON-21) with another long DNA template (ON-23) that is not complimentary to ON-22 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F3">Fig. 3</xref>b). Unsurprisingly, no ligation was observed using the ON-23 DNA template (lanes 10&#x02013;13 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F3">Fig. 3</xref>c). Our finding indicates that T4 DNA ligase can promote 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL on DNA/RNA hybrids in our optimal conditions and that this activity has certain steric substrate preferences that may be affected by differences in T4 DNA ligase&#x02013;substrate binding affinities.</p><fig id="dsy037-F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>3&#x02032; Branch ligation at the 3&#x02032; end of RNA in DNA/RNA hybrid.

Directional tagmentation library construction</title><p>Because 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL is useful for ligating adapters to several genomic structures with high efficiency, we explored its application in NGS workflows. Transposon-based library construction is rapid and consumes less input DNA compared with conventional NGS library preparation. However, using commercial transposon-based library preparation systems, only half of tagged molecules are flanked by two different adapter sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F4">Fig. 4</xref>a), and tagged DNA is flanked by self-complementary regions that could form stable hairpin structures and compromise sequencing quality.<xref rid="dsy037-B19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> In addition, the PCR-mediated incorporation of adapter sequences has not been adapted for whole-genome sequencing or PCR-free NGS library construction.</p><fig id="dsy037-F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>(a&#x02013;c) Schematic representation of three transposon tagmentation methods followed by PCR amplification using Pr-A (blue arrow) and Pr-B (green arrow).

Both Tn5 and MuA transposons work through a &#x02018;cut and paste&#x02019; mechanism, in which a transposon adapter sequence is end-joined to the 5<bold>&#x02032;</bold>-end of target DNA to create a 9 or 5-bp gap, respectively, at the 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>-end of the genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F4">Fig. 4</xref>a). Subsequently, 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL can be used to add another adapter sequence to the 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>-end of genomic DNA at the gap to complete the directional adapter ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F4">Fig. 4</xref>c). We used Tn5 transposons in this manuscript to compare the efficiency of the single-tagmentation + 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F4">Fig. 4</xref>c) to that of a double-tagmentation approach, which uses the two different Tn5-based adapters TnA and TnB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F4">Fig. 4</xref>a), and to that of another directional single-tagmentation strategy using Y adapters that contain two different adapter sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F4">Fig. 4</xref>b). Human genomic DNA was incubated with equimolar amounts of TnA and TnB transposome complexes, with the TnA transposome complex alone, or with the TnY (TnA/B) transposome complex. The product of TnA transposome-only fragmentation was further used as a template for 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL with the blunt-end adapter AdB, which shares a common adapter sequence with TnB. PCR amplification was performed using two primers, Pr-A and Pr-B, designed to recognize the TnA and AdB/TnB adapters, respectively. The quantification data suggested that TnA&#x00026;AdB had the highest efficiency compared with TnA&#x00026;TnB and TnY (TnA/B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F4">Fig. 4</xref>d). No significant amplification was observed when only one primer specific to TnA adapter was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F4">Fig. 4</xref>d). As expected due to PCR suppression, the TnA 3&#x02032;BL approach, the double-tagmentation approach, and the TnY approach all showed significantly higher PCR efficiency than the tagmentation reaction with only the TnA or TnB transposome complex alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F4">Fig. 4</xref>d).</p><p>We also sequenced these libraries using BGI&#x02019;s DNA nanoball-based sequencing platform and compared the base-positional bias among the transposon-interfered end, the 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL end, and the regular TA ligation end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F5">Fig. 5</xref>). It is obvious that the positional bias at the 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL end is less than that at the Tn5 end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F5">Fig. 5</xref>a and b), which occurs because the 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL end is influenced by both transposon interruption and 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL. Because only the first 6 nt (positions 1&#x02013;6) of the 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL end showed base bias and the bias was similar to but not exactly the same as that of its hybridized Tn5 end (positions 30&#x02013;35, after the 9-nt overhang), we conclude that the positional bias we observed at the 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL end is mainly caused by the Tn5 transposon. Therefore, 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL causes minimal bias and is similar to regular TA ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F5">Fig. 5</xref>c).</p><fig id="dsy037-F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Base distribution bias of Tn5-gap ligation (a), two transposons (b), and regular TA ligation (c).

In contrast, no ligation to the 5<bold>&#x02032;</bold>PO<sub>4</sub> end at the 5<bold>&#x02032;</bold>-recessed ends or in the gaps was observed (data not shown). This indicates that after binding to the 5<bold>&#x02032;</bold>PO<sub>4</sub> end of the dsDNA adapter, T4 DNA ligase can access the recessed 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold> end in the target DNA when DNA bends and exposes the 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>OH end. Unlike the mismatched or gapped ligation in previous reports,<xref rid="dsy037-B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup><sup>&#x02013;13</sup></xref> no base pairing of the donor DNA to the acceptor DNA was required with our 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL method. Moreover, even for a 1-nt gap, greater than 70% completion was accomplished using optimized conditions, while other template-independent ligation was of very low yield and was only detected by qPCR measurement.<xref rid="dsy037-B14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p><p>However, different 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL ligation efficiencies were observed for ligating 5<bold>&#x02032;</bold> T, A, or GA to 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold> T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F2">Fig. 2</xref>), which indicates some sequence preference at the ligation junction. Despite the recognized ligation bias,<xref rid="dsy037-B22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> T4 DNA ligase is commonly used in the adapter addition step during NGS library preparation. With its ability to perform 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL, T4 ligase can ligate adapters to several genomic structures that were previously considered unligatable, resulting in a higher template usage rate. For example, 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL can be coupled with single transposon tagmentation. The traditional double-transposon strategy has only 50% of the tagmented molecules that are amenable for the following amplification step. However, when DNA tagmentation is performed using one transposon with subsequent 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL, an increased yield of molecules with different adapters on each insert end can be acquired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Furthermore, the tagmented 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL products can be directly loaded on Illumina&#x02019;s flow cell as PCR free WGS libraries, which was difficult to achieve using double-transposon strategy. Other directional transposon protocols have been proposed using a Y transposon composed of two different adapter sequences<xref rid="dsy037-B23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> or replacing the unlinked strand from a single transposon with a second adapter oligo followed by gap filling and ligation.<xref rid="dsy037-B24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dsy037-B25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> However, these approaches continue to preserve the inverted adapter sequences and/or cannot insert sample barcodes adjacent to genomic DNA as the tagmented 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL protocol can. We performed a proof-of-concept study of a new directional tagmentation protocol for NGS library construction that eliminates inverted adapters and allows sample barcode insertion adjacent to genomic DNA. 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL after single transposon tagmentation can theoretically achieve 100% usable template, and our empirical data demonstrate that the new approach produced higher yield compared with traditional double transposon or Y transposon tagmentation. There are several explanations that the actual efficiency in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F4">Fig. 4</xref>d did not achieve 100%: The products of TnA&#x00026;TnB contained not only the correct PCR products from Primer A and B, but also the incorrect ones from single primer A or B (blue bars from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F4">Fig. 4</xref>d). Therefore, the process efficiency increase might be underestimated, if we directly compare the PCR yield of TnA&#x00026;TnB to that of TnA&#x00026;AdB. On top of that, The AdB used in this test was not the adapters (Ad-T or Ad-A) with highest ligation efficiency, because we had to match the sequences from TnA/TnB and TnY for direct comparison. Wang et al. later changed the adapter sequence to achieve better process efficiency and described it in their stLFR paper. Based on NGS data, the 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL ligated genomic ends also demonstrated fewer positions with positional base composition bias, and the first 6-nt bias was mild and mainly caused by transposon insertion, suggesting that 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL has minimal positional bias. Using this new library construction method, Wang et al. successfully achieved highly accurate and complete variant calling in WGS and near-perfect phasing of variants into long contigs with N50 size up to 23.4 mb for long fragment reading (BioRxiv, <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1101/324392">https://doi.org/10.1101/324392</ext-link>). 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL was also incorporated in a novel mate-pair NGS library workflow to effectively cut down the laboratory steps and costs by Dong et al. (BioRxiv, <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1101/400689">http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/400689</ext-link>).</p><p>In this study, we also investigated 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL using templates of a chimeric DNA/RNA duplex that forms a 5<bold>&#x02032;</bold> DNA and a 5<bold>&#x02032;</bold> RNA overhang (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsy037-F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Unexpectedly, blunt-ended dsDNA was efficiently ligated to the 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold> termini of RNA, but not DNA, suggesting that T4 ligase has a ternary complex formation preference. The ligation efficiency was greatly reduced if T4 RNA ligase I or II was used to join the ends. Some preliminary yet important applications of 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL with T4 DNA ligase are 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold> end labelling of RNA, the enrichment of mRNA or the construction of targeted RNA libraries, especially for miRNAs, the small regulatory RNAs whose uncontrolled expression leads to a number of diseases.<xref rid="dsy037-B26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dsy037-B27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Thus, our 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL technique can be readily applied to the detection of cancer or Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease by monitoring targeted miRNA. Hybridization with DNA probes targeting the Poly(A) tail or specific miRNA sequences can be used to create DNA-RNA hybrids with a RNA 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>-recessive end, which is followed by ligation of RNA to adapter sequences with sample and/or UID barcodes through 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL. These common sequences can then be reverse transcribed to produce the cDNA of targeted RNA sequences. Compared with current miRNA capture technologies, the use of 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL mediated by T4 DNA ligase could potentially provide several advantages for NGS RNA library construction. First, hybridization with a DNA strand would prevent secondary structure formation by the RNA strand and therefore mitigate the bias introduced by other protocols. Second, T4 DNA ligase enables high-efficiency adapter addition through 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold>BL, which avoids intramolecular RNA interactions that can be promoted by RNA ligases. Third, adapter dimers can be effectively eliminated, possibly rendering undesirable gel purification unnecessary. This new method could lead to improved unbiased microRNA expression profiling with simple and scalable workflows, and thus, large-scale research studies would become more affordable.</p><p>The findings of this study add to the growing understanding of T4 DNA ligase activities. We envision 3<bold>&#x02032;</bold> branch ligation becoming a general tool in molecular biology that will advance the development of new nucleic acid engineering methods beyond described NGS applications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="dsy037_supplementary_information.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="Ack1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge the ongoing contributions and support of all Complete Genomics and BGI-Shenzhen employees, especially Benjamin Allred for commenting the manuscript.</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by Shenzhen Peacock Plan (No. KQTD20150330171505310).</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>Employees of BGI and Complete Genomics have stock holdings in BGI.</p></sec><ref-list id="Ref1"><title>References</title><ref id="dsy037-B1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
