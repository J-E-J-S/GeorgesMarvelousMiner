They are best known for their highly mutative properties <italic>in vivo</italic>, which is due to polymerase slippage that results in repeat contraction/expansion. Although their mutation rates vary dramatically, even low estimates are 3&#x02013;4 orders of magnitude larger than of random point mutations, highlighting STRs as a tool of growing interest for various applications (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In disease, STRs are linked to tens of human diseases such as Huntington's disease (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>); In several cancer types, mismatch repair deficiencies are analyzed utilizing STR polymorphic state, pointing to the disease progression (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In genetics studies, STRs are utilized to study population genetics and phylogenetics (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In regulatory genomics, the importance of STRs as regulatory elements was recently demonstrated (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Recently, due to technological advancements in single cell (SC) genomics, SC STR analysis became of research interest for applications such as cell lineage phylogenetic analysis within an organism (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and for pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>A key challenge for STR analysis is that they undergo noisy amplification <italic>in vitro</italic>, similarly to <italic>in vivo</italic> replication slippage. This noise, often termed &#x02018;stutter&#x02019;, is commonly manifested by excessive peaks when STR length data is plotted in a histogram of lengths (see example in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Despite the value of the high polymorphicity of short unit STRs (e.g. in cancer diagnosis, forensics and phylogeny), they are still not commonly used for most assays due to excessive stutter noise. To address the stutter problem, simple noise models, such as highest peak analysis, are often employed when genotyping PCR-free NGS libraries or slowly mutating STR loci such as repeat units of three bases or more. These simple models do not apply to highly polymorphic STRs, such as mono and di repeats, specifically in samples, which undergo substantial amplification. Using such models in these cases is likely to result in false genotyping. The problem of genotyping highly polymorphic STRs is even more difficult when genotyping non-hemizygous loci (such as from autosomal chromosomes, X Chromosome in female and in copy number variation (CNV) cases) since it is compounded by amplification imbalance of the two alleles. Such unbalanced amplification is typical in SC studies, as the starting material for WGA is a single copy of each locus.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The synthetic STR experiment summary.&#x000a0;(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic description of the synthetic library. In each plasmid, a different synthetic STR construct was designed, synthesized and clone-sequenced for various STR types and length. The STR was designed within a context of an Illumina Truseq-HT dual index library to enable for nested PCR amplification at two time points (T<sub>2</sub>- amplification using outer primers only, T<sub>3</sub>-amplification using inner primers followed amplification by outer primers). The library is flanked by BsrDI restriction sites to enable direct sequencing of the STR library without amplification (T<sub>1</sub>). Internal barcode (yellow triangle) is a short sequence, unique to each STR length to detect for cross-contamination.

Dashed line at the 5% marks the lower threshold of analysis: data points below the mark were deemed too noisy and were excluded from downstream analysis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gky1318fig1"/></fig><p>With the growing need of <italic>in vitro</italic> amplification as a tool for basic and applicative scientific research, straightforward <italic>in vitro</italic> STR amplification studies were performed, in order to calibrate amplification factors and conditions (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref>). A common STR stutter noise rule of thumb is that STR mutation rate both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> is proportional to two main factors: (A) unit type length: short unit STRs (mono- and di-repeats) are more mutable than longer unit types. (B) STR length: Longer STRs (in repeat number) are more mutable than shorter STRs (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Nevertheless, despite years of STR research, a well-defined stutter behavior model is still lacking. The emergence of next generation sequencing (NGS) as a tool for large scale and detailed per-base analysis of STRs has re-emphasized the need for bioinformatics tools for STR analysis. While most current tools focus on mapping reads to the reference genome (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), their stutter error correction algorithms are mainly calibrated with statistical models based on indirect measurements such as STR distributions in progenies, in populations and/or in user-defined data sets. Here we present a method for controlled measurements of stutter behavior during amplification for various STR types and sizes. Utilizing these measurements, we calibrated a mathematical model that accurately captures and predicts the stutter pattern of <italic>in vitro</italic> STR amplification.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Controlled amplification noise measurement of a synthetic STR library</title><p>STR plasmid design: Sequence verified cloned plasmids containing synthetic STRs of different types and sizes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Table S1</xref>) were ordered from either IDT or GenScript (pIDT-kan and modified puc57-Kan vectors, respectively).

High throughput sequencing opens a new frontier for STR science, both for basic (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and for applicative research (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). With that understanding, in recent years, bioinformatics tools were developed to map and genotype STRs in a high-throughput genome-wide scale with improved accuracy and speed over standard mapping algorithms (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, current tools still struggle with the <italic>in vitro</italic> amplification stutter noise that is typical to STRs, and in particular to highly mutable STRs. Recent biochemical advances have enabled PCR-free protocols that substantially decreased the effect of stutter noise in STR analysis (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). However, these protocols have some limitations: (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) they require bulk amounts of template, making it incompatible with SC analysis, which requires whole genome amplification (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In most cases, only a fraction of the STRs in the genome is required for analysis and therefore targeted amplification is required (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Overall, this work lays the foundation for a better understanding of STR behavior in the NGS era. Although STR enrichment and sequencing kits are now available, a comprehensive assessment of the STR sequencing capabilities of extant sequencing machine was not systematically carried out, except for known constraints of some technologies such as mononucleotides sequencing in pyrosequencing based technologies (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and inferred estimation of such noise from old Illumina platforms (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Here we provided a controlled measurement of noisy sequencing at different amplification conditions and even in amplification free STR molecules.</p><p>We described here a new stutter model for the highly mutable STRs over <italic>in vitro</italic> amplification. The novelty of this model is that it is calibrated with NGS data generated by a controlled amplification of a range of di-repeat STRs of different types and sizes (according to their genomic occurrence in human). One key element in our model is that it takes into account that during amplification, the molecule lengths stochastic mutations can be accurately predicted, according to its inputs, the STR type, and the input length distribution of the previous amplification step. We chose to model the STR noise as a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC). Our model enables easy calibration of different types of STRs. However, our data clearly shows a distinct and unusual pattern of noisy amplification of AT, which currently cannot be determined by either Markovian or binomial models, and may require modified model in the future. This variation in mutational mechanism was suggested previously (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>We provided three types of experimental-based evidence for the effectiveness of our model:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Controlled amplification of STR plasmids. First, by utilizing it to measure an accurate amplification difference between known STR templates of various types and concentration, and second, by validating it against various types of polymerases.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Comparative analysis of STR amplification of thousands of genomic single cell STRs.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Both experiments have demonstrated the model robustness, such that although calibrated by a specific set of polymerases and conditions can be trustfully used as a quantitative tool for analyzing mutational processes by any NGS downstream process. Future work will enable a large-scale utilization of this model for assaying and/or optimizing other mutational processes, such as WGA.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Utilization of NGS genomics datasets from SCs by accurately analyzing STRs from biallelic histograms, from drifted histogram, unclear determination of single peaks, and unbalanced allelic representation.</p></list-item></list></p><p>We also compared our model to a state-of-the-art genotyping tool (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). As the highly mutable STRs studied here undergo frequent <italic>in vivo</italic> mutations even within the context of clonal expansion, a natural reference to compare our genotyping results against cannot be obtained. While synthetic STRs libraries such as the one used here to study the stutter patterns behavior, can provide a solid reference for genotyping, they are expensive to scale and do not encompass the complexities and degrees of freedom of genomic STR loci. We therefor approached a previously published dataset of <italic>ex vivo</italic> controlled cell lineage tree (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) that provides a solid phylogenetic reference to natural somatic mutations occurring in hundreds of STR loci, allowing indirect but accurate and large scale genotyping comparison. Our model outperforms both by the number of STR genotypes and both by the calling confidence, when compared with respect to the <italic>ex vivo</italic> tree.</p><p>We acknowledge that the bioinformatic improvement we provide here is mainly the stutter model itself, where current tools, mainly HipSTR, are implemented as a more inclusive STR genotyping tools in terms of phasing, haplotyping and interfaces with standard bioinformatics pipelines. Nevertheless, we recommend this model as an integrative step for STR noise analysis, specifically for SC analysis, where the sequenced samples undergo extensive amplification or in high sensitivity STR analysis, e.g. diagnosis of Microsatellite Instability (MSI) in cancer samples (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The tolerance of our model to noisy STR signal allows for a more flexible experimental design and opens the gate for highly mutable STR sequencing research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="SEC5"><title>DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>Sequencing data generated in this study have been submitted to ArrayExpress (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress">www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress</ext-link>) under accession number E-MTAB-7602.&#x000a0;The sequencing data used for the comparison conducted in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> can be found under accession E-MTAB-6411.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="gky1318_supplemental_files.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ACK1"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank O.
