Its medicinal function was first reported in the Chinese medicine monograph, <italic>Shennong Herbal Classics</italic>, in about 3500&#x02009;BC, which has over 5000-year history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. According to the modern pharmacological research, <italic>P. ginseng</italic> has various biological activities, such as antistress, antihypertensive, antivirus, antitumor, and immune modulatory activities, so it is not only widely used to cure central nervous system diseases and chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], but also used to fight against cancer and resist aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, it is known as the king of herbs and its genus name, <italic>Panax</italic>, means &#x0201c;cure all&#x0201d; in Greek [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The present economic value of <italic>P. ginseng</italic> in the global medicinal plant trade is estimated to be in excess of $2.1 billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">The main medicinal parts of <italic>P. ginseng</italic> are its roots and rhizomes. The major bioactive components are ginsenosides, kinds of triterpene saponins, including oleanane-type ones and dammarane-type ones, based on their chemical skeleton structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The precursors of these active compounds are terpenoids, which are the largest class of secondary metabolites produced by plants. Based on previous studies, ginsenoside biosynthesis process consists of three stages: terpene precursor biosynthesis, triterpene backbone biosynthesis and various ginsenoside generation. The first stage is to generate two types of terpene precursors, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and its isomer, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], through two isoprenoid biosynthetic pathways, mevalonate (MVA) pathway and 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, respectively, depending on the organism species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

Until 2014, Zhao and coworkers reported the MEP pathway also involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis by using inhibitor experiments on ginseng hairy roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

But our RNA-seq study launched comprehensive analyses not only on main mature ginseng tissues of 5&#x02009;years old but also on ginseng roots from one to five years old, for ginseng plant&#x02019;s medicinal part is usually its root tissues and the 5-year old ginseng plant is commonly regarded as mature enough to harvest for medicinal utility (Samukawa et a., 1995). Our RNA-seq study could better show the characteristics and changes of gene expressions relevant to both growth age and different tissues of ginseng plants. The results definitely revealed that the gene transcript abundances related to ginsenoside biosynthesis obviously began to increase since the age of 3&#x02009;years old and up to the highest levels at 5&#x02009;years old (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) when ginseng plants usually begin to be harvested in the cultivation conditions.

But there is no detail report about the MEP pathway in <italic>P. ginseng</italic> on transcriptomic levels except that Chen&#x02019;s study found there were intermediates of the MEP pathway in ginseng genomic study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Our study for the first time revealed that the genes related to the MEP pathway was mainly expressed in ginseng leaves, followed by in the lateral roots or root barks and lowest in the stems and root cores (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a), as well as the genes in the MVA pathway and the MEP pathway had almost similar transcription abundances in general (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b), indicating the MEP pathway also plays essential roles in ginsenoside biosynthesis in the tissues containing plastids or chloroplasts of <italic>P. ginseng</italic>. This finding is consistent with the plastic origin of the MEP pathway on evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and also consists with the results that most of the MEP pathway-related genes transcribed at higher in the leaves than in the roots in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and <italic>H. brasiliensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>IspD, the key gene of the MEP pathway</title><p id="Par67">Our further gene expression and co-expression network analyses also indicated that IspD might be a rate-limiting enzyme in ginsenoside biosynthesis in <italic>P. ginseng</italic>. The first reason is that based on the whole gene expression profiles related to ginsenoside synthesis in our study, IspD had the lowest expression level among all the ginseng tissue samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b), indicating that it might affect the subsequent IPP-derived metabolite production. The second reason is that the results of co-expression network analysis also referred to that IspD was a key gene in the MEP pathway (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The third reason is that there were fewer isoforms annotated on <italic>IspD</italic> gene (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) and fewer transcript abundances (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, c and Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b) for the <italic>IspD</italic> gene compared with other genes in the MEP pathway in our ginseng RNA-seq study. Therefore, we speculated that IspD might quite possibly be a key enzyme in the ginsenoside biosynthesis in <italic>P. ginseng</italic>.
