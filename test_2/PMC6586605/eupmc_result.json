    "Completion of the human genome sequence and recent advances in engineering technologies have enabled an unprecedented level of understanding of DNA variations and their contribution to human diseases and cellular functions. However, in some cases, long-read sequencing technologies do not allow determination of the genomic region carrying a specific mutation (e.g., a mutation located in large segmental duplications). Transformation-associated recombination (TAR) cloning allows selective, most accurate, efficient, and rapid isolation of a given genomic fragment or a full-length gene from simple and complex genomes. Moreover, this method is the only way to simultaneously isolate the same genomic region from multiple individuals. As such, TAR technology is currently in a leading position to create a library of the individual genes that comprise the human genome and physically characterize the sites of chromosomal alterations (copy number variations [CNVs], inversions, translocations) in the human population, associated with the predisposition to different diseases, including cancer. It is our belief that such a library and analysis of the human genome will be of great importance to the growing field of gene therapy, new drug design methods, and genomic research. In this review, we detail the motivation for TAR cloning for human genome studies, biotechnology, and biomedicine, discuss the recent progress of some TAR-based projects, and describe how TAR technology in combination with HAC (human artificial chromosome)-based and CRISPR-based technologies may contribute in the future."
