We developed a CRISPR/Cas-based directed evolution platform in plants to evolve the rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) SF3B1 spliceosomal protein for resistance to splicing inhibitors. SF3B1 mutant variants, termed SF3B1-GEX1A-Resistant (SGR), confer variable levels of resistance to splicing inhibitors. Studies of the structural basis of the splicing inhibitor binding to SGRs corroborate the resistance phenotype.

In directed evolution, genetic diversity is artificially increased to produce protein variants; this is followed by screening and selection for functional variants with improved fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Directed evolution via targeted sequence diversification and selection has revolutionized our ability to develop diverse biomolecules with novel and improved functions for various applications in basic biology and biotechnology.</p><p id="Par3">Most directed evolution approaches have been developed in bacteria or yeast. However, the functions of evolved biomolecules are best tested in their native cellular context to avoid serious drawbacks including stability and activity issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, the use of complex eukaryotes as hosts for the directed evolution of biomolecules improves the chances of successful selection of the sought-after variant for the intended application. Directed evolution platforms in mammalian cells include plasmid mutagenesis, followed by transfection and screening, in vivo mutagenesis via somatic hypermutations in immune cells, robotic cell-picking technologies, and error-prone DNA replication in the gene of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system has been harnessed for genome editing applications across diverse eukaryotic species including plants. CRISPR/Cas9 generates a site-specific double-strand break (DSB) at a user-defined DNA sequence. This DSB can be repaired via the precise homology-directed repair (HDR) or error-prone nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair mechanism thus producing a variety of genetic outcomes, including single-nucleotide changes and large or small genetic deletions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Very recently, cytidine deaminases and DNA polymerases fused to Cas9 variants have been used for localized diversification of gene sequences. This enables directed evolution for improved functions capitalizing on the bimodular function of these chimeric proteins, where Cas9 serves as a targeting module and the cytidine deaminase of DNA polymerase produces localized sequence changes in the targeted user-defined region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

To develop an efficient directed evolution platform in plants, we used a combination of targeted mutagenesis and selection. To this end, we designed a CRISPR/Cas-directed evolution (CDE) platform employing CRISPR/Cas9 to generate DSBs at all possible coding sequence sites in a specific gene of interest. CRISPR/Cas9 requires a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) of NGG for cleavage; therefore, only sequences adjacent to a PAM can be targeted.</p><p id="Par6">For CDE, a targeted library of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) is designed, cloned into a binary vector, and then transformed into <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> for stable plant transformation. Agrobacteria harboring the sgRNA library are used for plant transformation, and plants are regenerated under selective pressure to force accelerated evolution. This enables the recovery of protein variants that give the plant the ability to survive under selective pressure. Plant regenerants that survive the selective pressure are genotyped and their progeny phenotyped to link genotype to phenotype and examine mutant variants of the protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The ability to segregate out the CRISPR-Cas9 machinery and recover progeny plants harboring the evolved variant of interest without any foreign DNA makes this an elegant system for directed evolution applications.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The CRISPR/Cas-directed evolution (CDE) platform. <bold>a</bold> All possible sgRNAs targeting the whole coding sequence of a gene are designed. <bold>b</bold> The sgRNA library is constructed via oligo synthesis and annealing. <bold>c</bold> The annealed oligos are cloned with sgRNA scaffold under the <italic>U3</italic> promoter in the binary vector.

In plants, naturally occurring splicing inhibitors, including pladienolide B (PB) and herboxidiene (GEX1A), have massive effects on the splicing machinery, resulting in transcriptome-wide splicing repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

Work in mammalian cells showed that these splicing inhibitors target the core splicing factor SF3B1, of the SF3B complex of the U2 snRNP of the spliceosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. We have tested the effects of PB and GEX1A on <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (rice) seed germination and primary root (PR) length, and our data showed that these splicing modulators significantly inhibit seed germination and PR growth in a dose-dependent manner (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1).</p><p id="Par8">Due to the strong conservation with the mammalian SF3B complex, we hypothesized that the rice SF3B complex is targeted by these splicing inhibitors.

To test our CDE platform on the evolution of SF3B1 resistance to splicing inhibitors, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate SF3B1-resistant variants. Because splicing inhibition leads to inhibition of plant growth and development, we selected plants during regeneration of callus using a splicing inhibitor to identify resistant variants.</p><p id="Par9">To generate SF3B1 variants, we designed 119 sgRNAs targeting all possible PAM-adjacent sites in the whole coding sequence (CDS) of <italic>SF3B1</italic> (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1).

The plasmids of this library were pooled and transformed into the <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> EHA105 strain for stable transformation of rice (cv. Nipponbare) embryonic callus. Subsequently, we performed callus transformation and selection for stable transformation. From the transformed callus, we regenerated whole plants on different concentrations of GEX1A. We used different concentrations to provide variable levels of selective pressure to trigger NHEJ repair and generation of SF3B1 variants resistant to GEX1A. We sub-cultured 15,000 transformed calli onto medium supplemented with 0.4&#x02009;&#x003bc;M and 0.6&#x02009;&#x003bc;M GEX1A, concentrations that are sufficient to inhibit wild-type callus growth.

For example, the <italic>SGR1</italic> mutant had a 3-bp mutation causing a predicted single amino acid deletion of Q157.

The heterozygous knockout mutant was not heritable in the seed progeny. However, the in-frame mutant variant with the 15 amino acid deletion exhibited no resistance to GEX1A (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4). Because we were unable to recover any functional knockout (out-of-frame) mutants of <italic>SF3B1</italic>, we concluded that the loss of functional SF3B1 is embryonic lethal and that this is an essential gene for seed viability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Domain-focused directed evolution</title><p id="Par12">We then tested whether domain-focused directed evolution, in which targeted mutagenesis is conducted on key protein domains known to mediate key interactions for function, stability, or activity, was achievable in our CDE platform. We examined whether targeting SF3B1 protein domains, known to mediate drug&#x02013;protein interactions, in our CDE platform could generate SF3B1 variants resistant to GEX1A. We capitalized on our prior knowledge of the key SF3B1 domains that mediate drug interactions and spliceosome inhibition and designed sgRNAs targeting these domains (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3). HEAT repeats (HR) 15&#x02013;17 are highly conserved (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2 and S3) and splicing inhibitor-resistant mutations identified in mammalian cell cultures clustered around this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

To investigate whether GEX1A and PB share the same binding site in SF3B1, we tested whether GEX1A-resistant mutants were also resistant to PB by conducting primary root growth assays on media supplemented with PB (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S9). SF3B1 mutant variants were resistant to PB (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S9). The in-frame sensitive GEX1A mutant was also sensitive to PB. These data provide compelling evidence that these splicing drugs target the same SF3B1 domain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Structural basis of SGR resistance to GEX1A</title><p id="Par16">Recent reports have provided extensive structural studies on mammalian SF3B1 and the SF3B1:PHF5 complex and their interaction with various splicing inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Since rice and mammalian SF3B1 are &#x0003e;&#x02009;80% identical, we used these mammalian structures to study the structural basis of the resistance of the rice SF3B1 mutant variants to GEX1A and PB (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S10 and S11). Based on these structural models, we assessed the molecular effect of six OsSF3B1 variants on interactions with PB and herboxidiene. The SGS1 variant results in the deletion of an N-terminal loop-helix element (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S11). Although this deletion might mildly reduce protein stability, it is remote from the drug binding site and hence should not lead to drug resistance, in agreement with our experimental observations. The SGR3 K1050 variant is located at the rim of the drug binding surface and reinforces PHF5A interactions through an ionic bond to PHF5A D27 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S11). Deletion of K1050 perturbs the binding pocket&#x02019;s stereochemistry and weakens contacts to PHF5A.</p><p id="Par17">The SGR4 variant contains two mutations that are not predicted to have marked effects: K1049R is a substitution with similar physico-chemical properties, and although G1051H leads to inclusion of a much larger side chain, this change does not cause steric clashes, being exposed to the solvent (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S11). Conversely, K1050E will lead to electrostatic repulsion with GEX1A, weakening the drug binding interactions, and additionally introduce a repulsion with PHF5A D27 and weaken the OsSF3B1:PHF5A interaction.</p><p id="Par18">In the SGR6 variant (H1048Q, K1049 deletion, A1064S), H1048 and K1049 are located at the rim of the drug binding site, at the interface between OsSF3B1 and PHF5A (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S11). The double mutation H1048Q/K1049del will significantly destabilize the drug binding pocket and affect the binding to PHF5A. The third mutation A1064S is located 14&#x02009;&#x000c5; away from the drug binding site, and the relatively homologous substitution with a serine would only lead to minor local structural rearrangements.</p><p id="Par19">The SGR Q157 deletion and DAPDATPGIG (223&#x02013;232) variants carry mutations in the disordered loop region in the N-terminal of the protein, not included in our molecular models (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S10). We hypothesize that these deletions might affect additional interactions or regulatory roles that this region might have. Collectively, our structural analysis demonstrated that the drug-resistant variants contained driver and passenger mutations and that much of the effect was mediated through an OsSF3B1 region that is at the intersection between drug and PHF5A binding. Thus, the OsSF3B1&#x000a0;mutations appeared to have a double effect by destabilizing binding of both drug and PHF5A. We anticipate that these data will be useful to predict and identify drug resistance in various applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>SGR4 mutant variant exhibits efficient splicing in GEX1A treatment</title><p id="Par20">GEX1A and PB inhibit splicing and cause significant intron retention in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Therefore, we wanted to test the effects of GEX1A on the seedlings of wild-type rice and SF3B1 mutant variants and examine their molecular effects on splicing repression. Subsequently, we treated 1-week-old wild-type rice seedlings and SF3B1 variants with 0.3&#x02009;&#x003bc;M GEX1A for 6&#x02009;h. After extracting the RNA, cDNA was synthesized and semi-quantitative PCR was conducted on exons flanking selected introns.
