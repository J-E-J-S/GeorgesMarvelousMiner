The causative agent, chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV), is a positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a segmented genome. Segment 1 encodes three putative open reading frames (ORFs), including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and other non-structural protein coding regions. Segment 2 encodes four putative ORFs, which contain the genes of supposed structural proteins. In this study, we established a reverse genetic system for CBPV by molecular cloning of DNA copies of both genome segments. CBPV rescue was studied in imago and honey bee pupae infection models. Virus replication and progeny virus production was only initiated when capped RNAs of both genome segments were injected in honey bees. As injection of these clonal RNAs caused clinical symptoms similar to wild-type CBPV infection, we conclude that the novel molecular clone fulfilled Koch&#x02019;s postulates. Our virus clone will enable in-depth analysis of CBPV pathogenesis and help to increase knowledge about this important honey bee disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Viral pathogenesis</kwd><kwd>Viral transmission</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100007182</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium f&#x000fc;r Land- und Forstwirtschaft, Umwelt und Wasserwirtschaft (Austrian Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Zukunft Biene 2</award-id><award-id>Zukunft Biene 2</award-id><award-id>Zukunft Biene 2</award-id><award-id>Zukunft Biene 2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seitz</surname><given-names>Kerstin</given-names></name><name><surname>Buczolich</surname><given-names>Katharina</given-names></name><name><surname>R&#x000fc;menapf</surname><given-names>Till</given-names></name><name><surname>Lamp</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) is the causative agent of severe, usually fatal, paralysis in adult honey bees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. CBPV has not been assigned to any group or class of viruses by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) because it has a unique genome organization and virion morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, analyses of the nucleic acid sequence showed similarities between the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of CBPV and the RdRps of Tombusviruses, Nodaviruses, Lake Sinai virus 1 and 2 as well as the Anopheline associated C virus (AACV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">CBPV was one of the first viruses in honey bees to be described and isolated as it causes characteristic signs of disease in adult honey bees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Clinical signs of CBPV infection include two major syndromes; most affected bees show bloated abdomens, dislocated wings, and flight inability resulting in an accumulation of abnormally trembling and paralyzed bees in front of the hive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Some CBPV affected individuals develop a hairless, shiny, black appearance and are usually aggressively driven out of the hive by guard bees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. CBPV symptoms are often misinterpreted and overlooked in the fall as the beekeeper considers the fights at the hive entrance as robber bee attacks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. It is believed that the natural transmission of CBPV within the colony is mediated by close contact between infected and healthy bees and by the oral uptake of infectious particles from faeces of diseased animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. CBPV appears to have a wider host range as it has been found in two different ant species (<italic>Camponotus vagus</italic> and <italic>Formica rufa</italic>). Detection of CBPV nucleic acid in the parasitic Varroa mite (<italic>Varroa destructor</italic>) may indicate another possible route of virus transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, the low CBPV RNA copy numbers measured in ants and mites make it questionable whether these species are actually true hosts of CBPV or just passive carriers of infectious material. Honey bees can be infected with CBPV by topical or oral application and via injection under laboratory conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Very high CBPV genome loads exceeding 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>13</sup> genome equivalents (GE)/bee occur in symptomatic CBPV-infected adult worker bees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, the virus is able to infect honey bees at all developmental stages, with previous studies measuring low genome loads of about 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>3</sup> GE/bee in honey bee pupae and larvae in natural infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In contrast to the picornavirus-like virions of other bee viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, CBPV particles have a pleomorphic, oval appearance and a variable size, with a width of 20&#x02013;30&#x02009;nm and a length of up to 60&#x02009;nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The genome consists of two small single stranded RNA molecules (bipartite genome) of positive polarity, termed RNA1 (3.6&#x02009;kb) and RNA2 (2.3&#x02009;kb)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. While RNA1 contains the genes encoding enzymes of the viral replicase, RNA2 harbours the genes whose products are probably glycosylated structural proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Recent studies showed that the injection of the two small CBPV RNA segments is sufficient to initiate viral replication in honey bees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. It has been suggested that the genome segments of CBPV carry a 5&#x02032;-cap structure, because ORF1 of RNA1 contains domains homologous to the methyltransferase guanylyltransferase gene of alphaviruses which is involved in cap formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The 5&#x02032;-cap structure consists of a guanine nucleotide connected to the 5&#x02032; end of mRNA via a 5&#x02032;-5&#x02032; triphosphate linkage. The guanine is methylated by a methyltransferase at position 7, hence the name 7-methylguanylate cap (m<sup>7</sup>G-Cap). 5&#x02032;-cap structures are essential for the efficient gene expression of mRNA molecules and protect RNA molecules from degradation by cellular exonucleases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In this study, we have established a reverse genetics system for CBPV to test whether 5&#x02032;-cap structures are indeed essential for viral replication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Honey bees</title><p id="Par5">Adult honey bees (<italic>Apis mellifera carnica</italic>) and bee pupae for the experiments were collected from the apiary of the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna with the permission of the institution.

Traditional genetic analysis of viruses (forward genetics) focuses on a specific phenotype and tries to correlate this phenotype with the existence of a specific genotype by means of genetic analysis. Reverse genetics depends on molecular cloning and recombinant DNA technology and takes an opposite approach. Reverse genetics therefore begins with a cloned DNA molecule of a defined sequence, which is used to generate mutant genes that eventually produce a mutant phenotype. This makes it easier to decipher the functions of genes and to identify viral virulence factors. At the same time, reverse genetics avoids the experimental uncertainties arising from the heterogeneity within RNA virus species clouds. Reverse genetics systems have provided powerful tools to study all aspects of the virus biology and virus-host interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par27">As we have recently shown for DWV, one important key factor for generating a molecular clone of CBPV was to obtain the complete sequence of the genome segments applying established 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;- RACE PCR methods. Our data neither support the existence of a strong secondary structure as found in internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES) nor a protein at the 3&#x02032;-ends of the virus genome, as hypothesized by other studies, as the ligation of an adapter primer on the RNA and the subsequent amplification of the 3&#x02032;-end was possible without hindrances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Our reverse genetics system for CBPV consisted of two plasmids that allowed the separate transcription of both full-length genome segments. Transfection of both synthetic RNAs with synthetic 5&#x02032;- cap structures resulted in viral replication, production of infectious virus progeny, and 100% mortality of the transfected honey bee pupae. In our experiment, solely the synthetic transcripts including the 7-methyl-guanosine cap structure analogue were replicative after transfection and produced progeny virus. Hence, we directly demonstrate the importance of the 5&#x02032; -cap structure for CBPV replication confirming previous assumptions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par28">By introducing a genetic marker, we ensured the differentiation of our recombinant progeny virus from wild-type CBPV. The diagnostic restriction enzyme sequence was stably retained within RNA segment 1 over three passages. The recombinant CBPV replicated as efficiently as its parental isolate, reaching average viral titers of 8&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>12</sup> GE/bee after transfection. Interestingly, rCBPV and wtCBPV both produced high viral titers in honey bee pupae. These experimental results are not only in sharp contrast to an earlier study that reported very low viral titers in naturally infected honey bee pupae and larvae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, but are also in conflict with the hypothesis that CBPV is primarily a pathogen of adult honey bees. Future studies will test the infection of pupae and larvae under more natural conditions to study the biological significance of larval and pupal infections. Laboratory systems are going to be used, in which infected adult bees feed the brood in a controlled cage setup, to investigate CBPV transmission and pathogenicity in the bee brood. In addition, the infection of pupae by Varroa mites contaminated with CBPV will be further investigated. At this point, we cannot exclude that the observed virulence of CBPV in honey bee pupae is caused by the individual properties of the virus isolate CBPV Aut17. Therefore, the same approach using cDNAs of different CBPV strains will be performed in the future. Using topical infection, rCBPV was able to induce clinically relevant disease and high mortality in adult honey bees. As documented before, a sharp increase in mortality of the caged bees was observed after day 6 of infection and typical signs of CBPV were documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, neither the typical signs of the disease nor a comparable mortality rate were observed after the topical infection of adult honey bees with wtCBPV although an equal amount of genome equivalents was used. During the evaluation of these experiments, it was noticed that a significantly lower virus titer occurred in the wtCBPV bees after infection. We therefore assume that the wtCBPV stock solution had a lower effective infection dose, although it contained the same number of RNA molecules of CBPV RNA (measured by RT-qPCR in GE). Since there are no suitable cell culture systems for CBPV, we did not determine the real infection dose for this experiment (for example measured as TCID<sub>50</sub>), so this point cannot be conclusively clarified. For this reason, one focus of further work will be on developing methods for quantifying the infection dose of CBPV, like virus titration in honey bee pupae.</p><p id="Par29">Clinically relevant outbreaks of CBPV and the infection dynamics within the colonies are still poorly understood. The virus is widespread in the field and able to persist in colonies in covert infection cycles causing no obvious signs of disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Yet we have convincing evidence that CBPV infections of honey bee pupae via injection with RNAs or viral particles have a fatal outcome, confirming earlier observations about CBPV being competent of inducing overt disease with massive losses of honey bees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The extent of adult honey bee losses during the summer due to CBPV might be underestimated and it was assumed that a relevant proportion of all bee deaths among workers could be caused by CBPV, even in the covert infection scenario<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Further research is crucial to resolve the impact of CBPV on the honey bee population and to combat massive losses of worker bees during overt CBPV outbreaks. The establishment of a reverse genetics system is a first step towards elucidating the mechanisms of transmission, replication and pathogenicity of this interesting bee virus. The cDNA copy of one defined genome allows to produce a homogenous virus population and further enables a targeted manipulation of the CBPV genome <italic>in vitro</italic> to unravel the factors of pathogenicity of this virus.</p><p id="Par30">Koch&#x02019;s postulates were formulated in 1884 based on Henle&#x02019;s older concepts about infectious agents. The postulates are four criteria that must be met to establish a causal relationship between a microbe and a disease. In many approaches, attempts have been made to adapt the postulates to viral agents and the progress of modern infection research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, although the main features have always been retained: The pathogen must be detected in organisms suffering from the disease, but not regularly in healthy organisms. A pure culture of the pathogen should cause disease if it is properly inoculated into a healthy organism and the multiplication of the pathogen in the diseased host must be demonstrated showing that the pathogen is indeed identical. In the case of CBPV, no defined pure cultures have been established yet due to a lack of cell culture systems. In a strong approach to Koch&#x02019;s postulates, virus particles from CBPV bee cultures have been purified, the two RNAs extracted and inoculated into experimental animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Although this approach provided very strong evidence of a link between CBPV and disease symptoms, the possibility remained that contamination could falsify the results. The infectivity of fully synthetic RNAs, on the other hand, can be used as irrefutable evidence of the causal relationship between CBPV and clinical signs. Our CBPV clone satisfies Koch&#x02019;s postulates and will be a valuable tool for the in-depth analysis of CBPV pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec20"><p>
