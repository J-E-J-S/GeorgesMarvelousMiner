Critically, these other studies used strain-matched, but not pedigree-matched controls (i.e. the parents of sequenced offspring were themselves not sequenced) and thus were unable to reliably distinguish generational or colony-related differences from true DNMs. Here we assessed the impact of colony variation on the accuracy of detection of off-target CRISPR editing events.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>In this study, we used a trio design and whole genome sequenced 8 parents and 19 embryos, where 10 of the embryos were mutagenised with well-characterised gRNAs targeting the Tyrosinase (<italic>Tyr</italic>) locus (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007503.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold>). <italic>Tyr</italic> is responsible for black coat colour and eye pigmentation in C57BL/6 mice[<xref rid="pgen.1007503.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], so its disruption should not be detrimental to embryonic development. We chose two gRNAs targeting exon 2 of <italic>Tyr</italic>, Tyr2F and Tyr2R, with 395 and 1,502 total predicted off-targets respectively (Methods). The CRISPR-treated group was split to include five embryos treated with Tyr2F and five embryos treated with Tyr2R, while three untreated embryos from each of three control groups (&#x0201c;Cas9 only&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;No injection&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Sham injection&#x0201d;) were also collected. Microinjections were performed into the cytoplasm of 1-cell zygotes[<xref rid="pgen.1007503.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which were then briefly cultured to assess viability and then transferred into 0.5 day post coital (d.p.c) pseudopregnant females. Embryos in the &#x0201c;Sham injection&#x0201d; group were microinjected with water only, and the &#x0201c;Cas9 only&#x0201d; embryos were microinjected with Cas9 protein solution only. All embryos were harvested at 12.5 d.p.c (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s002">S1 Table</xref>) and genomic DNA from both parents and embryos extracted. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina X10 WGS platform yielding a median sequencing depth of 39.5x per genome (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007503.g001">Fig 1B</xref></bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s003">S2 Table</xref>). In parallel, targeted Illumina MiSeq sequencing to a mean depth of 10,800 reads of the <italic>Tyr</italic> target site was performed to comprehensively profile mosaicism, with these data analyzed using the CRISPResso software[<xref rid="pgen.1007503.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s004">S3 Table</xref>). MiSeq analysis revealed a targeting efficiency of 88% for Tyr2F and 91% for Tyr2R and mosaicism, with a median of two variants per embryo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s004">S3 Table</xref>). Importantly, to ensure our experiment was representative of the many thousands of CRISPR experiments performed worldwide, including those of the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium, we compared these data to MiSeq data from 324 mice mutagenized using the Tyr2R gRNA, revealing good concordance of targeting efficiency and mosaicism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s004">S3 Table</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen.1007503.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1007503.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Analysis of CRISPR off-targets by whole genome sequencing.</title><p>(a) Experimental design: Four sets of C57BL/6N parents gave rise to 9 control embryos (3 &#x0201c;no injection&#x0201d;, 3 &#x0201c;sham injection&#x0201d; with water only and 3 &#x0201c;Cas9 only&#x0201d;), and 10 treated embryos (5 were injected with Cas9 and Tyr2F gRNA and 5 were injected with Cas9 and Tyr2R gRNA). (b) Whole genome sequencing: All 27 mice / embryos were subjected to whole genome sequencing with median depth 39.5x and an average of 3.4% of bases with read depth less than 11x. (c) Variant calling and filtering: starting from the joint variant call (<italic>bcftools mpileup + bcftools call</italic>), a sequence of filter steps were performed to detect <italic>de novo</italic> mutations and remove likely false positives arising from low-level parental mosaicism and alignment errors at repeat regions. Parental-noise: alternate-allele reads present in either parent. Cross-noise: alternate reads from all other (non-parental) samples. (d) Filtered SNV and Indel counts are not significantly different within control groups, within treatment groups, or between control and treatment groups.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1007503.g001"/></fig><p>We next performed variant calling on the WGS data using <italic>bcftools mpileup</italic> and <italic>bcftools call</italic>[<xref rid="pgen.1007503.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], configured to be sensitive to low allele-fraction indels (insertions/deletions)(<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007503.g001">Fig 1C</xref></bold>). We started with a median of 324,561 variants per sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s005">S4 Table</xref>). Candidate DNMs (those not inherited from either parent) in the embryos were called using the TrioDeNovo software[<xref rid="pgen.1007503.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which resulted in a median of 7,460 unfiltered DNMs per embryo.</p><p>We first looked for the presence of these unfiltered DNMs within 10bp of any potential CRISPR off-target site for Tyr2F or Tyr2R, as determined by the Cas-OFFinder software[<xref rid="pgen.1007503.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] with up to 3 mismatches with a 1 nucleotide DNA/RNA bulge or up to 4 mismatches without a DNA/RNA bulge. Importantly, we found no such coincident sites in any embryos from the CRISPR-untreated group and only on-target variants in the CRISPR-treated group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s006">S5 Table</xref>), suggesting that if there are recurrent CRISPR-induced off-target alterations they are exceedingly rare. When we extended the number of mismatches up to 7 nucleotides (without a DNA/RNA bulge), we did find between 4 and 14 coincident sites per animal, but there was no significant difference in the number of such sites between CRISPR-treated and untreated groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s006">S5 Table</xref>, Methods). In fact, given the total fraction of bases at each possible off-target site and the number of candidate DNMs, we expected to find approximately 32 intersections between our candidate DNMs and the expected off-target positions based on chance alone (Methods). This is higher than the observed intersection counts, but is of the same order of magnitude.</p><p>We then filtered the original calls to ensure adequate depth (10x) and a variant quality of 10, in all samples, resulting in a median of 225,671 variants per sample and a median of 6,852 TrioDeNovo called DNMs per embryo (489 SNVs / 6,450 indels) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s005">S4 Table</xref>). We next applied a validated filtration strategy to refine our candidate DNM calls[<xref rid="pgen.1007503.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], removing false positives arising from mosaic alleles in either parent, as well as those in proximity to repeats. Alignments for all SNVs and indel variants were then inspected visually for the presence of mosaic alleles (i.e. a second alternative allele at the same locus). In the same way, all indels were visually inspected to remove further false positives. This resulted in a median of 19 SNVs and 1 indel per embryo (<xref rid="pgen.1007503.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which is broadly consistent with prior work that aimed to classify and estimate the <italic>de novo</italic> mutation rates in mice[<xref rid="pgen.1007503.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. All variants were validated using targeted MiSeq sequencing to a depth of at least 10,000 reads per locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s009">S8 Table</xref>), yielding an 87% validation rate for SNVs and a 73% validation rate for indels. This is lower than comparable rates from the Mouse Genomes Project[<xref rid="pgen.1007503.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], but this is expected, given the lower variant allele fraction of our variants. These rates are broadly comparable to validation rates for somatic variants called from cancer genomes.</p><table-wrap id="pgen.1007503.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1007503.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Initial and filtered <italic>de novo</italic> variant counts from whole genome sequencing.</title><p>Summary table of initial variant counts, <italic>de novo</italic> variant counts, and filtered SNVs and Indels.

(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s007">S6 Table</xref>) shows that of the 20 indels detected by the MiSeq pipeline, 18 were also detected by the WGS pipeline, with the missing indels having low allele frequencies (7% and 7.5%, as defined by MiSeq sequencing). We are therefore confident that our WGS pipeline will detect genome-wide off-target damage with a range of allele fractions and mosaicism similar to on-target variants. Our median on-target variant allele fraction is 0.28 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s007">S6 Table</xref>, column I), corresponding to a heterozygous mutation occurring at the two-cell embryo stage. Given our median depth (39.5x) and our minimum required <italic>de novo</italic> allele frequency (10%, Methods), our expected power to detect a DNM occurring in the single-cell or two-cell stage of the zygote is predicted to be at least 99.5%.</p><p>Using the final counts of filtered SNVs and indels for each embryo (<bold><xref rid="pgen.1007503.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>), we conducted a Kruskal-Wallis Rank test, detecting no significant difference in DNM counts between the &#x0201c;no injection&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;sham&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;cas9 only&#x0201d; untreated embryo groups (p = 0.30 and p = 0.37 for SNVs and indels, respectively). Similarly, a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test failed to detect significantly different SNV- or indel- DNM counts between the &#x0201c;Tyr2F&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Tyr2R&#x0201d; CRISPR-treated groups (p = 0.25 and p = 0.43 for SNVs and indels, respectively). Based on these analyses (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007503.g001">Fig 1D</xref></bold>), we combined variant calls from embryos in the two CRISPR-treated groups and in the same way combined data from the three untreated groups. Notably, using these data a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test failed to detect a significant difference in SNV or indel counts between the CRISPR-treated and untreated groups; p = 0.30 and p = 0.45, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s008">S7 Table</xref>).</p><p>We also measured the impact of using unrelated parents on the false-positive DNM rate by deliberately choosing the parents of the Cas9-only embryos when analyzing all embryos in the study; the male parent (CBLT8902) was greater than five generations removed from all other male parents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Performing a comparable subset of filtrations and comparing variant counts by sample to the correctly analysed embryos at the same filtration point showed a median increase of 66 false variants per embryo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s001">S1 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s010">S9 Table</xref>), highlighting the importance of using trios of mice when studying potential off-target rates.</p><p>Finally, to investigate the robustness of this result, we reanalyzed all of our genome sequencing data using a combination of two somatic variant callers (searching for SNVs with CaVEMan[<xref rid="pgen.1007503.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and indels with cgpPindel[<xref rid="pgen.1007503.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). These callers were used to search for SNVs and indels present in the treated and untreated embryos that were not present in the parents. The caller output was subject to an analogous filtering pipeline (Methods). Although not designed to search for DNMs, somatic variant callers can be more sensitive to low variant allele fraction mutations. Indeed, we detected more filtered mutations with this approach than with TrioDeNovo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s011">S10 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s012">S11 Table</xref>). However, identical statistical tests on the final filtered counts of SNVs and indels (Methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s013">S12 Table</xref>) again failed to detect any significant differences between gRNA-treated and untreated groups.</p><p>We conclude that if CRISPR mutagenesis performed under the conditions we have described were causing SNV or indel off-target mutations in treated embryos, then the number of these mutations is not statistically distinguishable from the background rate of DNMs occurring due to other processes. This work should support further efforts to develop CRISPR-Cas9 as a therapeutic tool.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec003"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Following approval by the Sanger Institute Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB) all procedures were performed at Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Research Support Facility under Home Office licensed authority, Establishment Licence Number X3A0ED725, Project licence number P96810DE8.

Off-target scores for the Tyr2F and Tyr2R gRNAs were determined for the default (NGG) PAM only, using the reference mouse genome (mm10) in the Cas-OFFinder tool[<xref rid="pgen.1007503.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] (<xref rid="pgen.1007503.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

Whilst we are not trying to directly compare our results to the Schaeffer paper [<xref rid="pgen.1007503.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], we feel that it is important to demonstrate that the off-target scores for our gRNAs are not significantly different to their study.

experiments we chose Tyr2R, comparing different Cas9 sources (mRNA or protein) as well as gRNA sources (<italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed or synthetic). The gRNA was mixed in RNase free water (Ambion) at a concentration of 25ng/ul together with either Cas9 mRNA or protein at 50ng/ul. The CRISPR reagents were injected into the cytoplasm of zygotes and F0 pups were scored for black, mosaic and albino coat colour. In addition, genomic DNA from earclips was extracted from F0 mice as described in section 3, and MISEQ sequencing analysis performed as described in section 4. This enabled us to determine the targeting efficiency and how many different alleles were present within each founder animal, therefore making it possible to score mosaicism (more than one mutated allele detected in the animal) for each condition. The synthetic gRNA was the most efficient, with 70% of pups showing a mutant genotype. Synthetic gRNAs were therefore used for the trio experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s004">S3 Table</xref>).</p><p>For the trio experiments, synthetic gRNA consisting of crRNA and tracrRNA (Sigma) were diluted and mixed in RNase free water at equimolar ratios of 0.7pmol/ul each. Cas9 protein (obtained from Marko Hyvonen, Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge) was added to a working concentration of 50ng/ul and the mixture was incubated at 25&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes before zygote injection.

The next morning females were checked for the presence of a vaginal copulation plug as evidence of successful mating and females housed separately, noting which males were used to plug each of the females. Oviducts were dissected one female at a time and harvests of cumulus masses kept separately in 4 different groups. Cumulus masses were released and treated with hyaluronidase as previously described[<xref rid="pgen.1007503.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

Microinjections were carried out using positive balancing pressure, microinjecting into the cytoplasm of fertilized 1-cell zygotes held in FHM medium. A successful injection was indicated by visible movement in the cytoplasm after breaking the Oolemma. Microinjected 1 cell embryos were briefly cultured and viable zygotes were transferred the same day by oviducal embryo transfer into a 0.5 days post coital (d.p.c.) pseudo-pregnant female F1 (CBA/C57BL/6J) recipients[<xref rid="pgen.1007503.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

(2) To avoid false positives arising from low-allele-fraction mosaic variants in either parent, we removed variants with <italic>any</italic> alternate-allele reads present in <italic>either</italic> parent (&#x0201c;parental noise&#x0201d;). (3) We removed any variant coincident with an allele reported in the C57BL/6NJ strain of the Mouse Genomes Project[<xref rid="pgen.1007503.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] or specifically in the C57BL/6N<sup><italic>Tyr</italic></sup> strain[<xref rid="pgen.1007503.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. (4) To avoid further false positives arising from low-allele-fraction mosaic variants present in the parents, we allowed a maximum contribution of only 2% alternate reads from all other (non-parental) samples (&#x0201c;cross noise&#x0201d;). (5) As repeat regions can cause mis-alignment of reads resulting in false positive calls, we merged all individual UCSC repeat tracks with the UCSC RepeatMasker track (about 1.2Gb of sequence) and removed any variant inside or 1bp adjacent to any merged repeat region. (6) We removed any <italic>de novo</italic> variant shared by two or more samples, as this would be extremely unlikely, and such mutations are more likely mosaic in the parents.

We used CaVEMan[<xref rid="pgen.1007503.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] to call SNVs and cgpPindel[<xref rid="pgen.1007503.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (a modified Pindel version 2.0) to call indels.</p><p>CaVEMan called between 1,854 and 3,700 passing variants per sample with a median of 2,845 variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s011">S10 Table</xref>, worksheet &#x0201c;Caveman&#x0201d;). In order to remove false positive variants, we applied the following filters to the CaVEMan calls: (1) ASMD (the median alignment score of reads showing the variant allele) &#x0003e; = 140. (2) Read depth &#x0003e; = 10 for both the embryos and the parents, and alternative read depth &#x0003e; = 4 in the embryos. (3) Variant allele fraction &#x0003e; = 10%. (4) Alternative read depth = 0 in either parent, to avoid false positives arising from low-allele-fraction mosaic variants. (5) Somatic calls had to be present in the comparisons with both parents. (6) Variants could not be shared between two or more samples. (7) Variants could not coincide with an allele reported in any strain of the Mouse Genomes Project[<xref rid="pgen.1007503.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. (8) We excluded variants inside or 1bp adjacent to any repeat region (we used UCSC repeat tracks as described above).</p><p>Using the default WGS panel of filtering rules [<xref rid="pgen.1007503.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], CgpPindel produced between 44 and 116 candidate indels per offspring, with a median of 71.5 indels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s011">S10 Table</xref>). To this output, we applied the following additional filters. (1) We selected the variants with allele fraction &#x0003e; = 10%. (2) We selected for each embryo only the somatic calls present in the comparisons with both parents. (3) We removed any variant shared by two or more samples. (We note that only one indel is shared between two samples, which are treated with the same gRNA&#x02013;namely, between MD5639a and MD5642a. However, this shared indel is in a microsatellite region, and it is not predicted to be a CRISPR off-target location). (4) We filtered variants coincident with an allele reported in any strain of the Mouse Genomes Project[<xref rid="pgen.1007503.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. (5) We excluded variants inside or 1bp adjacent to any repeat region (we used UCSC repeat tracks as described in the previous section).</p><p>After filtering SNVs and indels in this way, we obtained 14 to 36 SNVs per sample (median 21) and 0 to 6 indels per sample (median 2). All 471 SNVs and indels are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s012">S11 Table</xref>. The somatic calling pipelines identified 80% (313 out of 389) of the variants identified by the <italic>de novo</italic> mutation calling pipeline. The mutations identified by the somatic pipelines, which were not identified by the <italic>de novo</italic> pipeline, had a lower variant allele frequency (median of 12%) compared to those identified by both methods (median of 34%). We also noticed that cgpPindel identified an additional mosaic 337 bp deletion at the Tyr2F on-target location for MD5638a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s007">S6 Table</xref>).</p><p>As with the previous variant analyses, we performed a Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum or Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests to assess the null hypothesis that the SNV or indel counts from each of the control groups or treatment groups were drawn from the same population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007503.s013">S12 Table</xref>). We performed four such tests and they failed to produce any significant result at the Bonferroni-adjusted critical p-value of 0.0125.
