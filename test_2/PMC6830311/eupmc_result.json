    "Estrogen receptors (ER) include ER alpha, ER beta and new membrane receptor G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30). Estrogen receptors are key receptors to maintain ovarian granulosa cell differentiation, follicle and oocyte growth and development, and ovulation function. The abnormal functions of estrogen, its receptors, and estradiol synthesis-related enzymes are closely related to clinical reproductive endocrine diseases, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and endometriosis (EMS). At present, hormone therapy is the main treatment for ovarian-related diseases, and a stable hormone environment is established by regulating ovarian function. In recent years, some estrogen-related drugs have made great progress, such as clomiphene, which is a nonsteroidal antiestrogen drug in clinical application. This article elaborates on the regulatory role of estrogen and its nuclear receptors and membrane receptors in oocyte development, especially female reproductive diseases related to the abnormal expression of estrogen and its receptors. We also highlighted the latest advances of treatment strategy for these diseases and the application of related targeted small molecule drugs in clinical research and treatment, so as to provide reference for the treatment of female reproductive diseases."
