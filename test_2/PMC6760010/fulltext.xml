Here, we report single-cell transcriptome profiling of over 6,800 freshly dispersed anterior pituitary cells from postpubertal male and female rats. Six pituitary-specific cell types were identified based on known marker genes and characterized: folliculostellate cells and hormone-producing corticotrophs, gonadotrophs, thyrotrophs, somatotrophs, and lactotrophs. Also identified were endothelial and blood cells from the pituitary capillary network. The expression of numerous developmental and neuroendocrine marker genes in both folliculostellate and hormone-producing cells supports that they have a common origin. For several genes, the validity of transcriptome analysis was confirmed by qRT-PCR and single cell immunocytochemistry. Folliculostellate cells exhibit impressive transcriptome diversity, indicating their major roles in production of endogenous ligands and detoxification enzymes, and organization of extracellular matrix. Transcriptome profiles of hormone-producing cells also indicate contributions toward those functions, while also clearly demonstrating their endocrine function. This survey highlights many novel genetic markers contributing to pituitary cell type identity, sexual dimorphism, and function, and points to relationships between hormone-producing and folliculostellate cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pituitary gland</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>rat</kwd><kwd>single-cell RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>folliculostellate cells</kwd><kwd>hormone-producing cells</kwd><kwd>sexual dimorphism</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000062</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="12"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="90"/><page-count count="25"/><word-count count="18125"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The pituitary gland is a complex organ composed of anterior, intermediate and posterior lobes. The embryonic development of anterior and intermediate lobes is initiated by formation of a rudimentary Rathke's pouch, followed by development of a definitive pouch, which is critically dependent on expression of LIM homeobox genes <italic>Lhx3</italic> and <italic>Lhx4</italic> (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). At this developmental stage, <italic>Pitx1</italic> and <italic>Pitx2</italic> are also expressed in Rathke's pouch, but not in the adjacent ventral diencephalon, which forms the infundibular process and posterior pituitary (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Furthermore, Rathke's pouch is mainly composed of progenitor cells expressing <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Sox3</italic>, which are essential for progenitor proliferation and development of all major anterior pituitary cell types downstream of <italic>Lhx3</italic>/<italic>Lhx4</italic> (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). This is followed by expression of <italic>Prop1</italic> and other progenitor genes, detachment from the oral ectodomain and generation of three major hormonal cell lineages (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The expression of <italic>Tbx19</italic> in a fraction of these cells leads to generation of two cell types producing proopiomelanocortin (POMC): corticotrophs (C)&#x02014;secreting adrenocorticotropin, and melanotrophs&#x02014;secreting melanocyte-stimulating hormone (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The expression of <italic>Nr5a1</italic> is necessary for generation of gonadotrophs (G)&#x02014;secreting luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Finally, from a fraction of cells expressing <italic>Pou1f1</italic> are derived three cell types: thyrotrophs (T)&#x02014;secreting thyroid-stimulating hormone, somatotrophs (S)&#x02014;secreting growth hormone, and lactotrophs (L)&#x02014;secreting prolactin (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). These cell types, known as endocrine, secretory, or hormone-producing cells (HPC), release hormones predominantly through regulated exocytosis. C, G, T, S, and L are located in the anterior lobe, which also contains folliculostellate cells (FSC) and proliferative cells as well as endothelial cells (EC), pericytes, erythrocytes (E), and leukocytes (Le) from the pituitary sinusoidal capillary network. FSC are chromophobes (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and <italic>S100b</italic> was generally accepted as their marker gene (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This glia-like cell type has been suggested to be a heterogeneous group serving various functions, including structural, signaling, and supportive roles to HPC function. It has been suggested that a subset of FSC may serve as pituitary progenitor cells (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and that FSC and HPC could be derived from the same pool of cells (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>Different methodologies have been used to characterize these cell types. Early work with mixed pituitary cells led to identification of G protein-coupled receptors specific for HPC: C expressing corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor and arginine vasopressin receptor 1B, G expressing gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor, T and L expressing thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor, L expressing dopamine receptor D2 receptor, and S expressing growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor and somatostatin receptor 2 (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Population studies were used to characterize signaling pathways in these cells (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical methods helped to quantify the number and distribution of specific cell types within the gland and suggested the existence of multihormonal cells (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Elegant <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging helped to identify networks of FSC and HPC (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), whereas single-cell imaging and patch clamp experiments showed the cell type-specific electrical and calcium signaling patterns in unstimulated and stimulated cells (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). RNA-sequencing analysis in cultured rat anterior pituitary cells was used to identify upregulated genes and a GnRH controlled gene network in G (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to characterize gene expression in L&#x003b2;T2 gonadotroph cells (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), purified mouse gonadotrophs (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and dispersed male mouse pituitary cells (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Despite these advances, the gene expression patterns underlying the identity of anterior pituitary cell types, their functions, and their interrelationships remain incompletely understood.</p><p>To gain a transcriptome-wide perspective of rat anterior pituitary cell identities and functions, we performed scRNA-seq on freshly dispersed anterior pituitary cells from postpubertal male and female rats. We identified cell type-specific gene expression in HPC and FSC, examined cellular heterogeneity in these populations, and compared them with pituitary-non-specific cell populations: EC, E, and Le. Comparison of males and females, the latter in the diestrus phase of their estrous cycle, allowed us to identify sex-specific gene expression profiles in pituitary-specific cell types. Our differential expression analysis identified several groups of genes significantly upregulated in FSC, HPC, or both: development/differentiation, neuroendocrine, endogenous ligands, detoxification enzymes, extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, and cell adhesion molecules. We examined in detail the expression pattern of these genes in pituitary-specific cell types. This work provides a comprehensive transcriptional overview of the anterior pituitary gland that will facilitate future experimental and clinical investigations in this field.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>Penicillin/streptomycin and vitamin solution; phosphate buffered saline (PBS); and HEPES-containing M199 were from Gibco (Grand Island, NY).

After decapitation and removal of the brain, the posterior/intermediate lobes of the pituitary were removed and anterior pituitary glands were collected and used for RNA extraction or cell dispersion, the latter done using a trypsin/EDTA based method, as previously described (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Briefly, pituitaries were quickly collected from postpubertal rats and kept in 199 Hanks medium.

In the morning, cells were washed with PBS two times, fixed with 4% formaldehyde solution (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) for 10 min at room temperature and washed three times with PBS. For immunostaining, pituitary cells were incubated with primary mouse anti-S100B (1:500), rabbit anti-GH (1:250 and 1:500), guinea pig anti-GH (1:500), guinea pig anti-PRL (1:1,000 and 1:2,000), rabbit anti-SOX2 (1:500), rabbit anti-GATA2 (1:500), rabbit anti-ALDH1A1 (1:400), or guinea pig anti-ACTH (1:1,000) antibodies, followed by application of a corresponding secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit, or Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-guinea pig; all in 1:1,000 dilution). In single immunostaining for S100B, cells were incubated with anti-S100B antibody overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, followed by incubation with the secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. Double immunostaining was done in several combinations: rabbit anti-SOX2 followed by mouse anti-S100B or guinea pig anti-ACTH; rabbit anti-GATA2, followed by guinea pig anti-GH; rabbit anti-GH followed by guinea pig anti-PRL; and rabbit anti-ALDH1A1 followed by guinea pig anti-PRL or mouse anti-S100B.

After the subsequent incubation with the corresponding secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature, cells were incubated with the second primary antibody overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, followed by incubation with the secondary corresponding antibody for 30 min at room temperature. All antibodies were diluted in staining PBS solution containing 0.2% saponin and 0.5% BSA. Every step of the immunostaining protocol was followed by washing cells three times with PBS. Cells were mounted with Fluoromount-G, with 4&#x02032;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). All images were acquired on an inverted confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 780; Carl Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany), using a 63&#x000d7; Oil objective. Micrographs were sized, and their brightness and contrast levels adjusted in Fiji. Cells were counted on 12 tile-scan images (3 &#x000d7; 3). All experiments were done with anterior pituitary cells from postpubertal female rats and S100B and ALDH1A1 staining was also analyzed in anterior pituitary cells from postpubertal male rats.

The libraries were quantitated, pooled, and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 operated in RapidRun mode. The multiplexed libraries were run on two Illumina sequencing RapidRun flow cells. An average of 225 million reads were generated per sample.

To address this, 3&#x02032; annotations were extended by the lesser of 4 kb or half way to the nearest feature in a strand independent manner, so that gene annotations never overlapped. Mitochondrial gene annotations from a similarly extended Ensembl Rnor6 reference were appended to the extended NCBI reference. Extending the reference in this manner resulted in 194 genes originally having no counts shifting to having counts in at least 30 cells, and 1,420 genes with at least a 3-fold increase in counts. Among our four samples, the reads mapped confidently to exonic regions increased by 2.5 &#x000b1; 1%.</p><p>De-multiplexing, alignment to the extended reference transcriptome and UMI collapsing were performed using the Cell Ranger toolkit (version 2.1) provided by 10X Genomics.

Expression values <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>i, j</italic></sub> for gene <italic>i</italic> in cell j were defined as normalized UMI counts, calculated by dividing UMI counts for gene <italic>i</italic> by the total UMI count in cell <italic>j</italic>, to normalize for differences in coverage, then multiplying by the median total UMI count per cell. For visualization and some analysis steps, we computed the log<sub>10</sub> expression with a pseudocount of 1: log<sub>10</sub> expression = log<sub>10</sub>(E<sub>i, j</sub> + 1). For display in figures and tables, we converted some gene names from the NCBI reference symbol to the latest Rat Genome Database (RGD) symbols in two cases: first, gene symbols beginning with LOC or RGD were replaced by a more informative RGD symbol if the NCBI gene ID or RGD ID provided such a name; and second, genes for which the genomic location (chromosome, strand, start and stop position) had an exact match between the NCBI reference and the latest RGD annotation, and the RGD symbol was different from the NCBI gene name.

Dispersion was estimated for each gene as &#x003d5; = <italic>(s</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>-m)/m</italic><sup>2</sup>, where <italic>m</italic> is the sample mean and <italic>s</italic><sup>2</sup> is the sample variance. Dispersion values were normalized within each bin by subtracting the bin median then dividing by the bin median absolute deviation, and genes with the top normalized dispersions were selected. The log<sub>10</sub> expression values of the selected genes were centered and scaled by standard deviation, and resulting standardized values were clamped to [-10,10] to reduce the effect of genes highly expressed only in small subpopulations of cells as is done in Seurat (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.satijalab.org/seurat.html">http://www.satijalab.org/seurat.html</ext-link>). A final reduction was done by retaining only principle components (PCs) that were found to be significant by a permutation test, similarly to previously described methods (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Briefly, UMI counts were shuffled among cells for each gene independently, maintaining gene count distributions but destroying cell-wise correlations, and singular values were computed for the resulting count matrix. This was repeated 100 times to generate a null distribution of maximum singular values, into which the observed singular values could be ranked. The number of significant components was taken as the number of singular values that were larger than the maximum of the null distribution. This resulted in 26 (31) PCs for female (male) cells for use in cell type classification, 32 PCs for generation of the tSNE plot of all cleaned cells, 31 PCs for the tSNE plot of pituitary cells only. Computation of tSNE maps was done using the tsne function in the Matlab Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (R2018b), with perplexity of 40 and 2,000 iterations. A separate tSNE map was computed for all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>), all male and female cells separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S2</xref>), and all pituitary cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Identification of anterior pituitary cell types. <bold>(A)</bold> tSNE map showing identified cell types for both female and male cells: erythrocytes (E), leukocytes (Le), endothelial cells (EC), folliculostellate cells (FSC), corticotrophs (C), gonadotrophs (G), thyrotrophs (T), somatotrophs (S), and lactotrophs (L).

The use of marker genes was impaired by the fact that several highly expressed transcripts had non-specific expression at lower levels in cell types known not to express them, such as <italic>Gh1</italic> in erythrocytes and <italic>Hbb</italic> in somatotrophs. To overcome this, we computed an optimal log<sub>10</sub> expression threshold by Otsu's method (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) for each gene, allowing the classification of cells as expressing the gene (log<sub>10</sub> expression &#x02265; threshold) or not (log<sub>10</sub> expression &#x0003c; threshold). The optimal threshold is the value which maximizes the between-class variance of these two classes (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). We computed a histogram of each gene's log<sub>10</sub> expression values with 256 bins, and bin edges were taken as the possible threshold levels. The between-class variance, <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>&#x003c3;</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>B</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula>, was computed recursively across all 256 threshold candidates, and the gene threshold was defined as the threshold value maximizing <inline-formula><mml:math id="M2"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>&#x003c3;</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>B</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula>. For genes with unimodal distributions and dropouts, this approach leads to an underestimate of the percentage of cells expressing a given gene. For consistency, we applied this thresholding algorithm to all genes for cell-type classification, counting of percentages of cells expressing genes, and visualization of expression relative to the gene-wise threshold.</p><p>Pericytes, melanotrophs, and posterior pituitary cells could be identified using marker genes, but were excluded due to their small number and because the intermediate and posterior lobes were removed during dissection. Pericytes were identified by expression &#x0003e; threshold in at least two of <italic>Col1a1, Col1a3, Dcn</italic>, or <italic>Lum</italic> (48 cells) (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Melanotroph cells from the intermediate lobe were identified as expressing at least two of <italic>Pomc, Pcsk2</italic>, or <italic>Pax7</italic> (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) (58 cells). The transcription factor gene <italic>Tbx19</italic> was also expressed in these cells, as expected for melanotrophs (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). GEMs containing tissue putatively of posterior pituitary origin (possibly pituicytes and neurosecretory oxytocin or vasopressin neuron terminals) were identified by the presence of at least two of <italic>Lhx2</italic> (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), <italic>Nkx2-1</italic>, also known as TTF-1 (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), <italic>Gfap, S100b, Avp</italic>, or <italic>Oxt</italic> (56 cells).</p><p>For the remaining cells, cell type classification was performed hierarchically and independently for cells of each sex. First, E, Le, EC, FSC, and HPC were identified. Within the set of HPC, we then identified C, G, T, S, and L. To overcome the problem of dropouts (zero expression values) for known marker genes and to improve the robustness of classification, a set of several marker genes was used, for which expression of subsets of these markers is specific to a given cell type. For some cell types, an initial differential expression analysis between cell types classified with known makers was performed using the Loupe Browser to identify a larger set of marker genes. Expression &#x0003e; threshold in sufficiently many marker genes was taken to indicate cell type identity. The following classification criteria were used: E, expression &#x0003e; threshold for at least two of <italic>Hbb, Hbb-b1, Hba-a1</italic>, or <italic>Hba-a2</italic>; Le, two of <italic>Cd53, Tyrobp, Fcer1g</italic>, or <italic>Laptm5</italic>; EC, two of <italic>Plvap, Emcn, Clec14a</italic>, or <italic>Aplnr</italic>; FSC, two of <italic>S100b, Fxyd1, Gstm2</italic>, or <italic>Capn6</italic>; HPC, two of <italic>Resp18, Uchl1, Chgb</italic>, or <italic>Scg2</italic>; C, two of <italic>Pomc, Crhr1</italic>, or <italic>Avpr1b</italic>; G, two of <italic>Cga, Lhb, Gnrhr</italic>, or <italic>Fshb</italic>; T, two of <italic>Cga, Tshb</italic>, or <italic>Trhr</italic>; S, one of <italic>Gh1</italic> or <italic>Ghrhr</italic>; L, one of <italic>Prl</italic> or <italic>Agtr1b</italic>.</p><p>The fraction of UMI counts mapped to mitochondrial transcripts (f<sub>MT</sub>) was measured in classified cells, and cells with high f<sub>MT</sub> were excluded as potentially damaged cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S1A</xref>). The distribution of f<sub>MT</sub> differed among cell types, so within each cell type cells with f<sub>MT</sub> higher than 2 standard deviations above the mean were excluded, for a total of 278 cells. Similarly, we excluded outliers in the distributions of genes per GEM and total UMI counts per GEM in a cell-type specific manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S1B</xref>). We excluded cells in the highest and lowest 1.5% of the distribution, for a total of 305 cells. Thirty nine cells had both high f<sub>MT</sub> and were gene or UMI outliers.</p><p>The marker-based classification scheme could not classify 249 cells and identified 192 ambiguous cells satisfying more than one cell type criterion. Nearest-neighbor imputation was used to try to assign a cell type to unclassified cells. For each unclassified cell, its 30 nearest neighbors of the same sex were identified in PC space using Matlab's knnsearch function. Unclassified cells were assigned the cell type most frequent among their neighbors. Imputation succeeded for 225 of the unclassified cells. Cells remained unclassified if the most frequent neighbor class was ambiguous or unclassified (24 cells).</p><p>Ambiguous cells could be due to GEMs containing more than one different cell type (multiplets) or shortcomings of the marker-based classification scheme. Most multiplets were expected to be doublets, so we computationally identified doublet GEMs using an algorithm similar to the recently reported methods DoubletDetection (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/JonathanShor/DoubletDetection">https://github.com/JonathanShor/DoubletDetection</ext-link>), DoubletFinder (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) and Scrublet (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). We assumed that heterotypic doublets should cluster separately in gene space from the cell types that comprise them and that these clusters should be detectable if doublets appear in sufficient numbers. We boosted the set of true cells with 30% additional synthetic doublet cells created from randomly selected pairs of true cells, with replacement, for male and female cells separately (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figures S2A,B</xref>). Synthetic cell UMI counts were randomly subsampled from both parent cells to obtain a library size equal to the larger of the two parents. PCA dimensionality reduction was then performed on the boosted dataset. A k-nearest neighbor classification was then used to identify putative doublet cells. For each true cell in the dataset, 30 nearest neighbors were identified and the number of synthetic doublet neighbors were counted. The hypergeometric test was used to compute the probability of observing at least this many synthetic doublets in the group of 30 neighbors, given the known total numbers of true and synthetic cells (using Matlab's hygecdf function with the &#x0201c;upper&#x0201d; option). The <italic>P</italic>-values were then adjusted for multiple testing (one test per true cell) using Benjamini-Hochberg correction (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), and a GEM was deemed a doublet if adjusted-<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01. The process was repeated 10 times and doublets identified in any of the repetitions were taken as the final set of cells identified as doublets. The value of boost rate (30%) and number of nearest neighbors (nKNN = 30) were chosen empirically to be where the median number of doublets identified per repetition plateaued (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S2C</xref>). The algorithm identified 146 doublet cells, in line with the expected proportion of roughly 2% for each of our lanes of 2,000 cells (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Some of these doublets were also identified as cells to be removed for other reasons already mentioned. In total, 87 of the 192 ambiguous cells and 2 of the 24 unclassified cells from marker-based classification were also identified as doublets. Interestingly, only 3 of 278 cells with high f<sub>MT</sub> and 12 of 305 outlier cells, respectively, were also identified as doublets, suggesting that outliers in mitochondrial fraction, genes per cell, or counts per cell are not a reliable method for identifying doublets in this dataset. Finally, gene thresholds for further analysis were computed using the final set of cells with cells of both sexes pooled together.</p></sec><sec><title>Differential Expression Testing and Definition of Dominant and Specific Genes</title><p>To identify differentially expressed genes, we tested both for changes in expression and changes in proportion of cells expressing &#x0003e; threshold. Tests for changes in expression were performed for each gene using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test (Matlab's <monospace>kruskalwallis</monospace> function) followed by multiple comparisons between all pairs of cell types, with Bonferroni correction (Matlab's <monospace>multcompare</monospace> function). Similarly, we used Pearson's Chi-square test for independence for the proportion of cells expressing a gene &#x0003e; threshold, followed by pairwise <italic>Z</italic>-tests for the difference in proportions for each pair of cell types. The ANOVA <italic>P</italic>-value, Pearson's Chi-square <italic>P</italic>-value, and the pairwise contrast <italic>P</italic>-values were corrected for multiple comparisons to account for the number of genes tested using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). We considered a gene as significantly upregulated if the expression test or proportion test passed (adjusted ANOVA <italic>P</italic>-value and every <italic>P</italic>-value for the relevant pairwise contrasts were &#x0003c;0.001), and if there was an accompanying increase in mean expression or proportion of cells expressing the gene in the cell type of interest, relative to all other cell types being compared. For tests of differential expression between sexes, the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used (Matlab's <monospace>ranksum</monospace> function), followed by multiple correction for the number of genes tested.</p><p>To further identify genes of interest from the set of significantly upregulated genes, we considered only genes with at least 20% of cells expressing in a cell type of interest to avoid genes only expressed in a small subpopulation. We defined genes as <italic>dominantly expressed</italic> in a cell type if in addition they had at least 3-fold greater mean expression or 30% higher proportion of cells expressing &#x0003e; threshold in that cell type, relative to all other cell types of interest. We defined <italic>specific marker genes</italic> as dominantly expressed genes for which the % of cells expressing that gene was below 5% in all other cell types. For groups of cell types (PIT and HPC), the test for dominant or specific expression was satisfied for every pairwise combination of cell types within the group, relative to cell types outside the group.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of Cell Cycle Genes and Proliferating Cells</title><p>Initial investigation using the Loupe Browser showed a small group of cells expressing mitotic cell cycle markers. Beginning with a curated list of cell cycle genes (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), we identified proliferating cells and a set of cell cycle marker genes in our dataset using an iterative process. A cell cycle score was defined per cell as the number of genes in the list of markers that were expressed &#x0003e; threshold in that cell. Otsu's optimal threshold was then computed on the distribution of cell cycle scores for all cells, and cells whose score exceeded the threshold were classified as candidate proliferating cells. Next, genes with significantly upregulated expression (Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, adjusted-<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) in at least 50% of these cells, but &#x0003c;5% of the remaining cells, and that were also annotated with Gene Ontology term &#x0201c;mitotic cell cycle&#x0201d; (GO:0000278), were selected as the updated list of cycle marker genes. This updated list was then used for the next round of cell cycle score computation and cell classification. The process was repeated until the list of mitotic cell cycle marker genes and the cell classification stabilized. A final list of 39 genes was identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Table S3</xref>) with a final gene-count threshold of 14 genes expressed, which identified 108 cycling cells.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cell Populations in the Anterior Pituitary Gland and Their Marker Genes</title><p>Cells were dispersed using anterior pituitaries from four postpubertal female and male rats. scRNA-seq was done using four lanes on the 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell Controller (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA), providing two technical replicates for each sex.

Quality control removed 965 cells, including 60 melanotrophs (see Materials and Methods), leaving 6,896 cells for further analysis.

Cell type-dominant genes were defined as genes significantly upregulated in a cell type or group of cell types of interest relative to remaining cell types (for details, see Materials and Methods and <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Because these dominant genes could also be expressed at lower levels by some other cell types, we also defined a subset of dominant genes as cell type-specific markers if they were expressed in &#x0003c;5% of cells in every other cell type. This analysis revealed 60 genes dominantly co-expressed among all pituitary cells, distinguishing them from EC, Le, and E.

Our scRNA-seq analysis revealed that FSC, classified using multiple marker genes (Materials and Methods), represented ~34% of the cells in our cell preparation, whereas <italic>S100b</italic>-positive cells represented 27% of cells. To validate this aspect of our cell preparation, we evaluated the percentage of cells expressing S100B proteins in our double immunocytochemical studies with ALDH1A1/S100B and SOX2/S100B, and single S100B immunostaining done with anterior pituitary cells from males and females. In six independent experiments, the percentage of S100B-positive cells varied between 20 and 33%, with mean values of 25.6 &#x000b1; 1.9%.</p><p>There have been reports of bihormonal cells in the anterior pituitary, including lacto-somatotrophs that produce both GH and PRL (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). We did not find cells expressing both <italic>Gh1</italic> and <italic>Prl</italic> above threshold, so we performed additional immunocytochemistry experiments to clarify this issue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S4</xref>). Overnight-cultured anterior pituitary cells were incubated with rabbit anti-GH antibody, followed by incubation with guinea pig anti-PRL antibody. We used two dilutions for both antibodies: 1:250 and 1:500 for GH; 1:1,000 and 1:2,000 for PRL. Out of 5,238 analyzed cells, 2,768 cells were positive either for GH or PRL, but we did not observe co-expression of these proteins in any of the cells. Representative data are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S4</xref>. These data do not exclude the existence of lacto-somatotrophs in intact anterior pituitary tissue but confirmed the validity of our scRNA-seq analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Dissociation of cells from a tissue followed by scRNA-seq of freshly dispersed cells provides the possibility to group the cells based on their genetic profiles and frequently leads to discovery of new subpopulations or population of cells for this tissue (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). scRNA-seq also provides an excellent tool to identify typical genes for subpopulations within a tissue or organ, which is critical for cell type definition and provides a useful tool for cell type-specific labeling and manipulation (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Here we present scRNA-seq observations of adult male and female rat anterior pituitary cells along with an analysis of cell type- and sex-dependent transcriptome profiles.</p><p>This method also has some limitations that we and others have encountered. In scRNA-seq technologies such as the 10X Genomics Chromium system used here, a polyT primer is used to target the polyA region of fully transcribed mRNAs. As such, reads will map to the distal end of the 3&#x02032;UTR. We found many genes, expected <italic>a priori</italic> to be well-expressed in pituitary cells, for which reads mapped downstream of the 3&#x02032;UTR position annotated in the NCBI Rnor6 reference genome, as has been reported in other recent studies (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In those studies, one or more 3&#x02032;UTR annotations were manually extended using the full-length libraries constructed using bulk RNA-seq as a guide, with extensions ranging from 452 to 10.8 kb. Here, we opted to extend all 3&#x02032;UTRs by the lesser of 4 kb and the distance to the nearest genomic feature (including all non-coding gene types). This resulted in recovered counts for several genes of pituitary interest, including <italic>Prop1, Egr1, Isl1, Gnrhr, Smad4, Gnaq</italic>, and <italic>Fgf9</italic>, along with several hundred others. This automated method of extension could be improved by a more systematic comparison to full length transcripts, and such efforts could be eventually be used to improve the reference genome annotations.</p><p>Our tSNE mapping of anterior pituitary cells was consistent with classic knowledge about the presence of five populations of HPC, as well as FSC and EC, which are critical to pituitary function (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). We also observed a very small number of pericytes but did not analyze them here. We introduced a two-step differential expression analysis to identify dominant and cell-type specific (marker) genes for anterior pituitary cell populations. This analysis shows that two endogenous pituitary cell populations, FSC and HPC, express several common marker genes, including <italic>Pitx1, Pitx2</italic>, and some neuroendocrine markers, but each population is also characterized by specific marker genes. Consistent with the literature, our analysis confirms that <italic>Resp18</italic> (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>)<italic>, Uchl1</italic> (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), and <italic>Snap25</italic> (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) are good cell markers for all HPC. It has been reported that <italic>Chgb</italic> (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), <italic>Ptprn2</italic> (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), <italic>Scg2</italic> (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), and <italic>Syp</italic> (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>) are expressed in some HPC types, but here we show that these genes are marker genes for all HPC. In addition, we identified 30 novel specific markers common to all HPC types.</p><p>Gonadotrophs expressed the expected marker genes <italic>Lhb, Fshb</italic>, and <italic>Gnrhr</italic> (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), as well as <italic>Spp1</italic> (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), <italic>Nr5a1</italic> (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), and <italic>Amhr2</italic> (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). We also identified 18 novel markers and numerous dominant genes for G. In addition to the well-established markers for C, <italic>Pomc, Crhr1, Avpr1b</italic>, and <italic>Tbx19</italic> (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>), here we provide evidence for 15 novel markers for these cells. The marker genes for L are <italic>Prl, Agtr1b, Drd2</italic>, and <italic>Gal</italic> (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>), with 9 novel genes suggested here. The commonly accepted markers for S are <italic>Ghrh1, Gh1</italic>, and <italic>Sstr2</italic> (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). Our analysis identified the first two genes in S only, whereas <italic>Sstr2</italic> was co-expressed by S and T, and we also found that <italic>Pappa2</italic> is a marker gene for S. Finally, our data confirmed that <italic>Tshb</italic> is a marker gene for T. We were unable to detect <italic>Drd2</italic> expression in T, arguing against a hypothesis that dopamine plays a role in control of these cells' function (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>), but we identified five novel markers for these cells. The discovery of these novel marker genes for HPC types not only provides tools for their identification, but also points to further studies to evaluate the role of these genes in cell type-specific functions.</p><p>A recent study reported scRNA-seq data of male pituitary cells (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In contrast to our study, their experiments were done with mouse pituitary cells and included the intermediate and posterior lobes, in addition to the anterior lobe of pituitary. They were also able to identify five HPC types expressing known marker genes for these cells and to list additional genes typical for these cells. There is overlap of our dominant genes with the markers identified in their study; for example, <italic>Tgfbr3l, Spp1, Foxp2</italic> for G, <italic>Dio2</italic> for T, <italic>Pappa2</italic> and <italic>Cabp</italic> for S, and <italic>Hepacam2</italic> for L. Some genes listed in their study as novel marker genes for HPC types were also detected in our study, but they do not satisfy our stricter criteria for listing as dominant and specific marker genes. We should not exclude that species differences could also contribute to differences in novel marker genes for HPC types. We found a similar set of cells expressing cell cycle marker genes that predominantly comprised <italic>Pou1f1</italic>-expressing cells, with a similarly small fraction of cells (~1.5% of cells in our study and ~1.25% in their study), suggesting low rates of proliferation in anterior pituitary gland at this life stage. All the markers identified for proliferating cells in their study were also found in our proliferating cells, and all but two (<italic>Hmmr</italic> and <italic>Cdca3</italic>) were identified as markers using our iterative method (Methods and Materials). We present here a detailed description of FSC genes and a comparison with HPC, which was not addressed in their study.</p><p>Our data clearly show that sex-specificity in expression of genes accounts for G and L subclusters observed in our sex-combined tSNE map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). We also observed significant differences in expression of genes in S from males and females, but very little sexual dimorphism in C and FSC. Previously, we reported larger differences in expression of those genes in L, G and S, but not in C during development (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Here we report elevated expression of <italic>Prl</italic> (in L), <italic>Cga</italic> (G), and <italic>Lhb</italic> (G) in females, and elevation of <italic>Fshb</italic> (G) in males, although only <italic>Fshb</italic> met our criteria for sex-dominant expression. In contrast, no sex-specificity in <italic>Pomc</italic> (in C), <italic>Cga</italic> and <italic>Tshb</italic> (T), and <italic>Gnrhr</italic> (G) was observed. Our analysis identified many genes in addition to these hormone genes that may underlie the sexual dimorphism observed in some cell types. The list of 288 sex-dominant genes in L is impressive and provides a solid base for further work on this topic. In G we identified 128 genes expressed in a sex-specific manner, and others have observed an impressive diversity in expression of specific groups of genes in purified G from males and females during development and in cycling females (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In agreement with that study, we found that <italic>Asic2</italic> was dominantly expressed in our diestrus female G cells, while <italic>Adcyap1r1, Gata2</italic>, and <italic>Jun</italic> are male-dominantly expressed.</p><p>In a recent study, the sex-specific changes in expression of 48 pituitary genes was detected across postnatal mouse development (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). In postpubertal rats, we detected the expression of 34 of these genes in more than 5% of cells, mostly in a sex-non-specific manner, indicating a transient nature of sex-specific expression during puberty. However, the sex-specific expression was preserved for some genes postpubertally. Among them, only two of these genes were listed as sex-specific using our criteria stated in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>: <italic>Pgr</italic>, expressed dominantly in G from females, and <italic>Fshb</italic>, expressed dominantly in G from males. With a less restrictive criteria (at least 2-fold higher proportion of cells expressing genes than the other sex), several other genes were expressed in a sex-specific manner; G from postupubertal females expressed more <italic>Bdnf</italic> and <italic>Kiss1</italic>, whereas postpubertal males expressed more <italic>Begain</italic> (L), <italic>Map2k5</italic> (L) and <italic>Pcsk1</italic> (T). We also detected sex-specific expression in the opposite sex from that reported previously for a few genes: <italic>Gnpda2</italic> (L), <italic>Reep3</italic> (T), <italic>Tyw</italic>3 (L), and Ntrk2 (G).</p><p>One of the conclusions of work with male mouse scRNA-seq was that individual HPC types form subclusters (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In general, among cells of a given sex, this could be consistent with literature data about bihormonal cells found in anterior pituitary, lacto-somatotroph (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) and/or gonado-somatotroph (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) for example. We did not find evidence of these bihormonal subtypes of HPC based on scRNA-seq analysis or immunocytochemistry in our cells, so we cannot comment on their transcriptional profiles. We do not exclude the possibility that such bihormonal cells were selected against during cell dispersion. Alternatively, pituitary cell subtypes observed in scRNA-seq could reflect cells with specializations in function or separate positions in the gland. Further work should be done to better assess the presence and characteristics of pituitary cell subtypes.</p><p>FSC have been reported to represent 4&#x02013;20% of pituitary cells (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>); they are chromophobes (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and <italic>S100b</italic> is generally accepted as their marker gene (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Our scRNA-seq and immunocytochemical analyses revealed that FSC represented a larger percentage of all anterior pituitary cells in our preparation (scRNA-seq, ~34% of cells classified as FSC, with ~27% of cells expressed <italic>S100b</italic> greater than threshold; immunocytochemistry, between 20 and 33% S100B-positive cells, with mean values of 25.6 &#x000b1; 1.9%). This might reflect differences in animal age and cell dispersion protocols between studies. Possible contamination with posterior pituitary cells, which also express S100B (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>) was excluded by the finding that <italic>Gfap</italic>, a posterior pituitary-specific gene (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), was essentially undetected by scRNA-seq or qRT-PCR. It has also been suggested that pituitary chromophobe cells are a heterogeneous population composed of typical FSC and other cell types classified as follicular, marginal, mesenchymal, and immune cells, and that some of these cells could be candidates for progenitor cells (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). Our transcriptome analysis does not shed light on such a morphological distinction, but the tSNE map suggests two genetically diverse FSC subtypes present in both sexes. Future work based on this dataset is expected to reveal novel information regarding FSC heterogeneity.</p><p>Our data may, however, suggest links between FSC and progenitor cells. In a previous report of scRNA-seq in male mice (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), a cluster of pituitary progenitor cells was defined based on <italic>Sox2</italic> expression alone. In our dataset, <italic>Sox2</italic> was co-expressed with <italic>S100b</italic>, the accepted marker of FSC, in both scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) and immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figure 12</xref>) as has been reported by others (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The expression of <italic>S100b</italic> was not examined in their study. We note that most of the genes they identified as significantly upregulated in their <italic>Sox2</italic> cluster, including <italic>Lcn2, Aldh3a1, Aldh1a2, Rbpms, Cdh26, Cpxm2</italic>, and <italic>Sox2</italic>, were dominantly or specifically expressed in our FSCs, and that <italic>Aqp4</italic> was found in 15% of FSC but not in other cell types. This suggests that these may reflect similar populations of cells.</p><p>Development and differentiation of HPC have been extensively investigated (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). It has also been repeatedly suggested that FSC may serve as pituitary progenitor cells (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and that FSC and HPC are derived from the same pool of cells (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Our analysis identified several genes expressed among both FSC and HPC from a group of 64 genes known to contribute to pituitary development and differentiation. Furthermore, we found numerous neuroendocrine marker genes to be expressed in both populations of pituitary cells. The co-expression of development genes, such as <italic>Pitx1, Pitx2</italic>, and <italic>Lhx3</italic>, as well as several neuroendocrine markers in both populations of pituitary cells suggests that HPC and FSC may be viewed as sister cells, i.e., cells of a common origin, or that a subset of FSC are pituitary stem cells, as discussed in the literature (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>).</p><p>We also demonstrated some novel expression patterns of these genes. For example, <italic>Sox2</italic>-positive cells are believed to represent 3&#x02013;5% of cells in the anterior lobe in adult animals, usually co-expressing <italic>Sox9</italic> and considered to be the stem cells of anterior pituitary (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). We found that 69% and 53% of FSC expressed <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Sox9</italic>, respectively, and that <italic>Sox2</italic> was also expressed in a fraction of C and T. This finding was confirmed by immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figure 12</xref>). Others have also reported that <italic>Sox2</italic>/<italic>Sox10</italic> expressing cells account for the generation of <italic>S100b</italic>-positive cells (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>), but <italic>Sox10</italic> was not detected in our dataset. <italic>Gata2</italic> is well-established to be critical in the development of T (together with <italic>Pou1f1</italic>) and G (without <italic>Pou1f1</italic>) (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). Consistent with this, we observed the expression of <italic>Gata2</italic> in most G and T cells. However, we observed that about 9% of S also express this gene, as well as that 8% of GH positive cells co-express GATA2 protein, indicating heterogeneity of this cell type and a potential role of <italic>Gata2</italic> in its differentiation/function. It has been indicated that <italic>Six3</italic> and <italic>Six6</italic> regulate G-specific gene expression (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). We observed the expression of <italic>Six6</italic> in FSC and all HPC types (predominantly in L and C), whereas <italic>Six3</italic> was expressed in FSC and L only. These findings indicate that in the rat, <italic>Six3</italic> is not essential for postnatal expression of G-specific genes and that both genes may have functions in other cell types, including FSC.</p><p>Pituitary cells expressed genes encoding endogenous ligands, which predominantly serve as autocrine/paracrine factors for G-protein coupled receptors, tyrosine kinase receptors, ligand-gated receptor channels, and cytokine/chemokine receptors. Numerous endogenous ligands have been suggested to be secreted by pituitary cells and to act in a paracrine manner (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). Among them we found only a few genes expressed in the indicated cell type: <italic>Pdyn</italic> (G), <italic>Tac1</italic> (T, S), <italic>Vegfb</italic> and <italic>Vegfc</italic> (all pituitary cells), <italic>Inha</italic> and <italic>Inhbb</italic> for potential to produce inhibin B and activin B (G), and <italic>Anxa1</italic> (FSC). Our study confirms that the following genes were expressed in pituitary cells, but the cell types expressing them differed from those listed by Denef (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>): <italic>Gal, Nmb, Nmu, Nppc, Penk, Agt, Calca, Edn3, Cartpt, Tgfb3, Inhba, Mif, Vegfa, Angpt1</italic>, and <italic>Fst</italic>. Expression patterns of the following genes encoding endogenous ligands could not be assessed as they were expressed in &#x0003c;5% of cells in all cell types: <italic>Vip, Adcyap1, Grp, Crh, Ucn, Ucn2, Npy, Nts, Adm2, Edn1, Edn2, Avp, Oxt, Ghrl, Hcrt, Fgf2, Tgfa, Lif, Il1a, Il6</italic>, and <italic>Lep</italic>. However, in addition to 44 genes for endogenous ligands confirmed to be dominantly expressed in at least one pituitary cell type, we identified 50 other such genes expressed above the 5% threshold. These findings will guide further work on physiological relevance of these novel genes and crosstalk among FSC and HPC.</p><p>Complex enzyme systems protect organisms from a wide array of xenobiotics, from food components to environmental toxins to pharmaceuticals, with liver playing a major role in these processes (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). Other tissues also have mechanisms for protection. The roles of these enzymes in pituitary functions have not been investigated systematically. Earlier work has proposed scavenger functions for FSC, focusing on their role in clusterin removal and metabolism of ammonia (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Our list of at least 79 detoxification enzyme genes expressed in pituitary cells clearly indicates that this process is complex, that FSC play a major role in this function, and that HPC also contribute to this function. For example, here we identify for the first time that pituitary cells express 13 of 19 known aldehyde dehydrogenase genes, and six of them are dominantly expressed in FSC: <italic>Aldh1a1, Aldh1a2, Aldh1a7, Aldh2, Aldh3a1</italic>, and <italic>Aldh3b1</italic>. These enzymes catalyze the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids. They are involved in the metabolism of alcohols formed endogenously and xenobiotics that contain alcohol groups, and they further metabolize alcohol metabolites of xenobiotics. Here we also show that male but not female L express the <italic>Aldh1a1</italic> gene and ALDH1A1 protein, which has androgen binding activity (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). Carbohydrate sulfotransferase genes are also expressed in pituitary cells; the enzymes transfer sulfate to carbohydrate groups in glycoproteins and glycolipids. Two of these genes are specific for FSC, others are expressed in HPC as well. Our search revealed that only one of these enzymes have been previously identified in pituitary (<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>).</p><p>The ECM provides physical scaffolding and biochemical support to the surrounding cells, and is composed of proteins and polysaccharides secreted by cells (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). Here we identified a list of 53 genes encoding ECM proteins that were expressed in pituitary cells. Among them, collagens are ECM proteins encoded by over 40 genes. The expression of collagen 1&#x02013;4 in the pituitary gland has been reported (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). Here we provide novel evidence for expression of 18 members of this family of genes; 11 of these genes were expressed in FSC, whereas <italic>Col2a1, Col8a1, Col11a2, Col16a1, Col17a1</italic>, and <italic>Col24a1</italic> are expressed in HPC only. The expression and role of laminin in gap junction formation in FSC has also been reported earlier (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>), as well as that laminin and collagen modulate expression of fibromodulin in FSC (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). There are 12 members of the laminin gene family, and here we show that seven of them are expressed in anterior pituitary cells. Both FSC and HPC express these genes in a cell-type specific manner. FSC have also been suggested to express small leucine-rich proteoglycans (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), and we confirm here expression of <italic>Bgn, Fmod</italic>, and <italic>Prelp</italic> in FSC. Together, these findings suggest the cell-type specificity in the formation of the extracellular space structural proteins in anterior pituitary gland.</p><p>Cell adhesion molecule genes encode proteins allowing cells to bind to other cells or the ECM. They typically comprise an intracellular domain that interacts with the cytoskeleton, a transmembrane domain, and an extracellular domain that interacts with another cell adhesion molecule or ECM component (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). This group contains six subgroups of genes with over 300 members. Among them, cadherins are the largest group. Cadherins are calcium-dependent adhesion molecules whose role in the formation of S, L, and C tumors was studied previously (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>, <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>), but not their expression pattern in anterior pituitary cells. Here we show that both type I classical and type II classical cadherin genes are expressed in pituitary cells. Out of 18 genes of these two families, we identified 12 genes in anterior pituitary; six genes are expressed only in FSC, four for HPC, and 2 are expressed in both FSC and HPC. Protocadherins also constitute a large family of genes encoding proteins composed of up to seven cadherin-like motifs that are distinct from those present in classical cadherins. Many of these proteins are highly expressed in the nervous system and are frequently localized to synapses (<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). Here we show that protocadherin genes are also expressed in anterior pituitary. We identified 14 of these genes expressed in a cell type-specific manner. Integrins are cell membrane heterodimeric receptors that mediate cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix adhesion. The expression and roles of integrins in the pituitary gland have been studied previously (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>, <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). Here we show that seven genes from this family are also expressed in anterior pituitary; all of them were identified in FSC and <italic>Itga3, Itgab1</italic>, and <italic>Itgae</italic> in all HPC types as well. Finally, the expression of claudins 2, 4, and 5 in FSC and EC (<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>) has been reported, but we have not found evidence that these genes were expressed in more than 5% of anterior pituitary cell types.</p><p>In conclusion, we used 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell System-generated data from freshly dispersed cells and detailed differential expression analyses to better understand the complexity of anterior pituitary cells. Our transcriptome survey, combined with selective immunocytochemistry and qRT-PCR analysis, is consistent with the existence of five HPC types, critical for anterior pituitary gland function as a central endocrine regulator of numerous physiological functions including reproduction, growth, metabolism, and stress responses. Among HPC, the expression of cell type-specific genes is most noticeable within corticotroph and gonadotroph lineages, whereas sex specificity in gene expression is most prominent within the lactotroph, gonadotroph, and somatotroph lineages. Our analysis also points to impressive transcriptome diversity of FSC, as well as the expression of pituitary stem/progenitor marker genes in FSC and HPC. The expression pattern of two group of genes, which we named development/differentiation and neuroendocrine genes, unquestionably demonstrates that FSC and HPC are sister cells. Identification of cell type-dominant and -specific genes also points to complex interactions between HPC and FSC in the production of endogenous ligands and detoxification enzymes, organization of ECM, and expression of cell adhesion molecules. Further analysis of other gene families, including those encoding receptors, channels/transporters, intracellular signaling molecules, and transcription factors will help refine these relationships. This and similar studies will be crucial guides for future experimental and clinical investigations into pituitary functions and related disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data Availability</title><p>The datasets generated for this study have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and are accessible through GEO Series accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="GSE132224">GSE132224</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE132224">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE132224</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The animal study was reviewed and approved by the NICHD Animal Care and Use Committee (16-041).</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>PF, SC, and SS: conceptualization.
