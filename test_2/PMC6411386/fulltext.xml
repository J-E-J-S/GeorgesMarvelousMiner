This is achieved by a large na&#x000ef;ve antibody repertoire whose diversity is expanded by somatic hypermutation (SHM) following antigen exposure.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The diversity of the naive human antibody repertoire is estimated to be at least 10<sup>12</sup> unique antibodies.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Since the number of peripheral blood B cells in an healthy adult human is on the order of 5&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>, the circulating B cell population samples only a small fraction of this diversity. Full-scale analyses of human antibody repertoires have been prohibitively difficult, primarily due to their massive size. The amount of information encoded by all the rearranged antibody and T cell receptor genes in one person -- the &#x0201c;genome&#x0201d; of the adaptive immune system -- exceeds the size of the human genome by more than four orders of magnitude. Further, because much of the B lymphocyte population is localized in organs or tissues that cannot be comprehensively sampled from living subjects, human repertoire studies have focused on circulating B cells.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Here, we examine the circulating B cell populations of ten human subjects and present the largest single collection of adaptive immune receptor sequences described to date, comprising almost 3 billion antibody heavy chain sequences. This dataset allows genetic study of the baseline human antibody repertoire at unprecedented depth and granularity, revealing largely unique repertoires for each individual studied, a subpopulation of universally shared antibody clonotypes, and exceptional overall repertoire diversity.</p><p id="P4">Eighteen sequencing libraries were generated for each of ten subjects (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure ED1</xref>). These libraries yielded 2.90&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> raw reads. Following annotation,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> which included duplicate removal using unique molecular identifiers,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> we obtained 3.64&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> productive antibody sequences (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table ED1</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Amplification was reproducible, with similar gene usage between replicates (Figures <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">ED2</xref>). The frequencies of IgM-encoding (0.62&#x02013;0.94) and IgG-encoding (0.06&#x02013;0.38) sequences were consistent with the expected frequency of circulating B cells expressing these isotypes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Although V-gene, J-gene and CDRH3 length (VJ-CDR3len) distributions were similar between subjects (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C, E-F</xref>), differences were large enough that individual repertoires could conceivably be distinguished using only these features. We reduced sequence subsamples to VJ-CDR3len frequency distributions and quantified similarity using the Morisita-Horn similarity index.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Subject repertoires were clearly distinguishable using as few as 10<sup>4</sup> sequences (Figures <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">ED4</xref>) and did not cluster by age, gender or ethnicity (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). The IgG<sup>+</sup> repertoires were least similar, suggesting that subjects&#x02019; unique immunological histories are a significant contributor to repertoire individuality (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). A one-versus-rest support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained on VJ-CDR3len data from 5 of the 6 biological replicates from each subject accurately assigned the remaining replicate using test/train datasets of as few as 500 sequences from each replicate (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>).</p><p id="P6">To estimate repertoire diversity while minimizing the effects of sequencing and amplification error, we first considered clonotype diversity. An antibody clonotype is a collection of sequences using the same V/J-genes and encoding an identical CDRH3 amino acid sequence.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> For each subject, all sequences from each biological replicate were collapsed into a set of unique clonotypes. Any clonotypes repeatedly observed after pooling deduplicated biological replicates must be derived from different cells, providing a straightforward means of quantifying multiple occurrence. For clarity, clonotypes or sequences present in multiple biological replicates from a single subject will be called &#x0201c;repeatedly observed&#x0201d;, while clonotypes or sequences found in multiple subjects will be called &#x0201c;shared&#x0201d;.</p><p id="P7">Rarefaction curves indicated a low frequency of repeatedly observed clonotypes, supported by capture-recapture sampling (3.9&#x02013;11.7% recapture; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">ED6</xref>). To estimate repertoire diversity, we selected two estimators: Chao2 and Recon. Chao2 is a non-parametric estimator that uses repeat occurrence data from multiple samples to estimate species richness.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Recon uses maximum likelihood to estimate species richness, assuming only that the overall size of the repertoire is large (relative to sampling depth) and well mixed.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> These estimates represent the total diversity capable of being generated by the humoral immune system. Accordingly, these estimates may greatly exceed the actual number of B cells present in a single individual at any one time. The estimators produced similar estimates of clonotype diversity for each subject, with identical rank order (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Recon consistently estimated about 2-fold greater repertoire diversity (2&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup>-1&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>) than Chao2 (1&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup>-5&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup>), consistent with reports that Chao2 underestimates richness for samples with a non-negligible frequency of rare species.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Pooling unique clonotypes from multiple subjects allowed us to estimate cohort-wide diversity (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Chao2 (5&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>) and Recon (5&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>) produced nearly identical estimates for the complete 10-subject pool. Estimates of cohort-wide clonotype diversity exceed individual subject estimates by less than two orders of magnitude, suggesting a relatively high frequency of shared clonotypes. We next sought to estimate the sequence diversity for each individual, again using both Chao2 and Recon estimators. As expected, the estimates for sequences were substantially higher than for clonotypes, with Chao2 (2&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup>-2&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>) and Recon (1&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup>-2&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>) producing comparable estimates for each subject. Unlike the cohort-wide clonotype estimates, Recon estimated much lower cohort-wide sequence diversity (1&#x000d7;10<sup>10</sup>) than Chao2 (1&#x000d7;10<sup>11</sup>; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). The light chain repertoire is estimated to be approximately four orders of magnitude less diverse than the heavy chain repertoire (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Figure ED7</xref>) and pairing of heavy and light chains is approximately random,<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> producing a total paired sequence diversity estimate of 10<sup>16</sup> to 10<sup>18</sup>. The most commonly cited estimate for antibody repertoire diversity, 10<sup>12</sup> unique sequences,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> considers only the unmutated na&#x000ef;ve repertoire. As such, our sequence diversity estimates, which include both the na&#x000ef;ve and memory sequences, are not directly comparable to this previous estimate. Clonotype diversity estimates, which incorporate only V and J gene assignments and the CDRH3 amino acid sequence, minimize the influence of SHM and are more suitable for comparison with prior estimates of na&#x000ef;ve repertoire diversity. The cohort-wide paired clonotype diversity using either estimator, under the same assumptions about light chain diversity and random pairing, is estimated at 3&#x000d7;10<sup>15</sup>, over three orders of magnitude greater than previously estimated for the na&#x000ef;ve repertoire.</p><p id="P8">While it is known that convergent antibodies may arise from different individuals in response to immunological exposure and a low frequency of CDRH3 sharing has been observed in healthy adult repertoires,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> the overall prevalence of repertoire sharing is unknown. For each combination of two or more subjects, we computed the frequency of shared clonotypes (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Pairs of subjects shared, on average, 0.95% of their respective clonotypes and 0.022% of clonotypes were shared by all ten subjects. We next used two approaches to quantify the expected frequency of clonotype sharing by chance. Hypergeometric distributions, based on cohort-wide clonotype diversity (Chao2) and the number of unique clonotypes for each subject, indicated a low likelihood that the observed sharing was due to chance (8.8&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>, Bonferroni-corrected p=0.05 is 1.1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>). We also generated synthetic antibody sequences using IGoR<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> to determine the expected frequency of clonotype sharing due to coincident V(D)J recombination. Synthetic sequence sets were generated using three different recombination models: 1) IGoR&#x02019;s default model, inferred from unproductive antibody rearrangements and is thus focused only on parameters related to V(D)J recombination; 2) subject-specific recombination models inferred from unmutated sequences from each subject; and 3) a combined-subject recombination model inferred from a pool of unmutated sequences drawn from all subjects. For each model, 10 batches of 10<sup>8</sup> sequences were generated, for a total of 3 billion synthetic sequences. In the sequence sets generated with IGoR&#x02019;s default model, clonotype sharing was 7-fold lower than in human repertoires (0.0032%; <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) indicating that coincident V(D)J recombination alone is not sufficient to explain the observed sharing. The subject-derived synthetic sequence sets showed much more sharing (0.1% and 0.16%, respectively; <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">ED8</xref>). In addition to containing information about V(D)J recombination, the subject-derived models also implicitly encode information about selection processes involved in B cell development. The increased clonotype sharing frequency in subject-derived synthetic datasets indicates that the sieving effect of B cell development produces naive repertoires that are more similar than recombination alone would be expected to produce. Combined with our observation that naive-enriched repertoires are more similar than class-switched repertoires (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>), a model emerges in which individual repertoires are quite dissimilar after V(D)J recombination, are homogenized during B cell development, and become increasingly individualized following differential responses to immunological exposure.</p><p id="P9">While the CDRH3 length distributions of unique and repeatedly observed clonotypes were similar, short CDRH3s were much more common in shared clonotypes (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-D</xref>). The skew toward short CDRH3s in the shared population is likely due to the increased probability of similar recombination events among shorter CDRH3s. In contrast, repeatedly observed clonotypes are more often the result of clonal expansion, as evidenced their increased mutation frequency (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). Shared nucleotide sequences showed a strong inverse relationship between mutation frequency and the number of shared subjects (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>); virtually all sequences shared by 4 or more subjects were unmutated. Thus, while coincident recombination infrequently produces identical antibody sequences, the likelihood of coincident recombination linked to an identical set of somatic mutations is exceptionally low.</p><p id="P10">Antibody CDRH3s can be divided into two primary regions: the framework-proximal &#x0201c;torso&#x0201d; and the more variable &#x0201c;head&#x0201d;.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> When comparing size-matched samples of shared and unshared clonotypes, we noted less diversity in the head regions of shared clonotypes. Further, head region diversity in shared clonotypes was inversely related to CDRH3 length, a relationship not seen in unshared clonotypes or synthetic repertoires (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). This inverse relationship, along with the skewed distribution of CDRH3 lengths in shared clonotypes (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), indicates two distinct processes shaping the shared clonotype population. The shortest shared CDRH3s encode head region diversity similar to unshared CDRH3s and synthetic CDRH3s of the same length (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Thus, short CDRH3s are likely shared primarily due to their lower CDRH3 diversity and concomitantly higher likelihood of independent generation by coincident recombination. In contrast, longer shared CDRH3s are less diverse than unshared or shared synthetic populations (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>) and more commonly encode head regions enriched in polar, uncharged residues and lacking hydrophobic residues (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). This implies the existence of a mechanism by which these shared clonotypes are selected or enriched post-recombination based on the biochemical properties of their CDRH3 regions.</p><p id="P11">In summary, sequencing the circulating B cell population of ten individuals at unprecedented depth has revealed repertoires that are highly individualized and extremely diverse. We estimate cohort-wide repertoire diversity of approximately 5&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> unique heavy chain clonotypes and as many as 1&#x000d7;10<sup>11</sup> unique heavy chain sequences. This indicates that the paired antibody diversity available to the circulating repertoire is very large, perhaps in the region of 10<sup>16</sup>-10<sup>18</sup> unique antibody sequences. Despite enormous diversity, clonotypes are shared more frequently than would be expected from coincident V(D)J recombination. Further, we found that clonotype sharing likely is driven primarily by selection processes related to early B cell development rather than convergent responses to common antigens. The possible clinical and diagnostic applications of adaptive immune repertoire sequencing are myriad, however, much work remains. The results described here are confined to circulating B cells, which represent a minority of the total B cell population. The repertories of circulating and tissue-resident B cells are known to differ,<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and these differences may influence overall repertoire diversity and sharing. Further, we have only studied ten individuals from a limited age range (18&#x02013;30 years) and geographic region at a single time point. Much larger cohorts representing diverse ethnicities, geographies and ages will be required to capture the true population-wide repertoire diversity. Nevertheless, large-scale sequencing of the human adaptive immune repertoire holds immense potential. Our use of high-level antibody feature frequencies to differentiate repertoires raises the possibility of identifying and classifying discrete repertoire perturbations associated with autoimmune disease and chronic infection. Further, because the adaptive immune receptor repertoire encodes a comprehensive record of an individual&#x02019;s immunological encounters, leveraging large-scale adaptive immune receptor sequencing as a means to diagnose infection or deconvolute infection histories is appealing. Finally, the individuality of each subject&#x02019;s baseline repertoire suggests that personalization of vaccine delivery and therapeutic intervention may produce substantial benefits in the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases.</p><sec id="S1"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="S2"><title>Leukapheresis samples</title><p id="P12">Full leukopaks (3 blood volumes) were obtained from ten human subjects (Hemacare). Samples were collected at Hemacare&#x02019;s Southern California donor center. Sample collection was performed under a protocol approved by the Institutional Research Boards of Scripps Research and Hemacare. Informed consent was obtained from each subject. All subjects were healthy, HIV-negative adults between the ages of 18&#x02013;30 with no reported acute illness in the 14 days prior to leukapheresis. The subject pool was gender balanced and evenly divided between African-American and Caucasian individuals (ethnicity was self-reported; <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 1</xref>). Immediately upon receipt of the leukopak, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were purified by gradient centrifugation and cryopreserved.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Amplification strategy and primer bias</title><p id="P13">We elected to use RNA as the template for antibody variable gene amplification, as this focuses our analysis on productive heavy chain rearrangements and permits the use of amplification primers that anneal to the CH1 region (due to the presence of an intron between the JH gene and CH region, the use of CH1 primers is not feasible when amplifying from DNA). The decision to use RNA has some inherent downsides, however, primarily the likelihood of over-representation of transcriptionally active B cells (namely, memory B cells and plasmablasts). It should be noted that the use of molecular barcodes, which allow identification and collapsing of reads that originate from the same RNA molecule, will not correct this problem. To reduce the influence of multiplexed primer sets on the resulting composition of antibody genes that are amplified, we designed an amplification strategy that limits the use of multiplexed primers that anneal to the variable (V) gene region in an attempt to reduce primer bias during amplification. Following cDNA synthesis, 2nd strand synthesis was performed using multiplexed V gene primers that encode an overhang that comprises a portion of the Illumina adapters required for next-generation sequencing. V gene primers were then enzymatically removed before subsequent amplification of the antibody genes using the conserved overhang as the primer annealing site. Thus, the multiplexed V gene primers were only used for a single round of amplification.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Antibody gene amplification</title><p id="P14">For each subject, total RNA was separately isolated from 6 aliquots of approximately 5&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> cryopreserved PBMCs (RNeasy Maxi, Qiagen). For each RNA aliquot, antibody genes were amplified in triplicate (18 total samples per subject), with each of the technical replicates processed independently and starting with a separate aliquot of the RNA sample. To minimize the likelihood of cross-contamination between subjects, RT and PCR reactions for each subject were processed in isolation, such that samples from two different subjects were never in proximity during amplification reaction preparation. All primers<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> are listed in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 2</xref>. In order to increase the sequencer-perceived nucleotide diversity during each sequencing cycle, &#x0201c;offsets&#x0201d; were added to the RT and 2nd strand synthesis primers. Three sets of these primers were synthesized, with each set containing either 2, 4 or 6 random nucleotides at the offset position (see <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 2</xref>). These offsets stagger the conserved constant and framework regions and result in much higher diversity during each sequencing cycle and minimize the required PhiX spike. cDNA synthesis was performed on 11ul of RNA using 10pmol of each primer in a 20ul total reaction (SuperScript III, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol and the following thermal cycling program: 55C for 60 minutes, 70C for 15 minutes. Residual primers and dNTPs were degraded enzymatically (ExoSAP-IT, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. The entire enzyme-treated cDNA synthesis product was used in a 100ul second strand synthesis reaction using 10pmol of each primer (HotStarTaq Plus, Qiagen) using the following thermal cycling protocol: 95C for 5 minutes, 55C for 30 seconds, 72C for 10 minutes. Residual primers and dNTPs were again degraded enzymatically (ExoSAP-IT) and dsDNA was purified using 0.8 volumes of SPRI beads (AmpureXP, Beckman Coulter Genomics) and eluted in 50uL of water. Antibody genes were amplified using 40uL of eluted dsDNA and 10pmol of each primer in a 100ul total reaction volume (HotStarTaq Plus) using the following thermal cycling program: 95C for 5 minutes; 25 cycles of: 95C for 30 seconds, 58C for 30 seconds, 72C for 2 minutes; 72C for 10 minutes. DNA was purified from the PCR reaction product using 0.8 volumes of SPRI beads (AmpureXP) and eluted in 50uL of water. 10ul of the eluted PCR product was used in a final indexing PCR (HotStarTaq Plus) using 10pmol of each primer in 100ul total reaction volume and using the following thermal cycling program: 95C for 5 minutes; 10 cycles of: 95C for 30 seconds, 58C for 30 seconds, 72C for 2 minutes; 72C for 10 minutes.

Because the 5&#x02019; end of each paired read encodes the unique molecular identifier (UMI), reads were quality trimmed only at the 3&#x02019; end using Sickle (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.github.com/najoshi/sickle">www.github.com/najoshi/sickle</ext-link>), using a window size of 0.1 times the length of the read, minimum average window quality score of 20, and a minimum read length after trimming of 50 nucleotides. Because UMIs are located on the &#x02018;outside&#x02019; of the gene-specific primers used for amplification (see <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 1B</xref>), primer trimming was delayed until after UMI processing. Processed reads were quality checked again using FASTQC, and paired reads were merged with PANDAseq using the default (simple_bayesian) merging algorithm.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Molecular barcodes</title><p id="P17">Although sequencing libraries were constructed to encode molecular barcodes on both ends of the amplicon, we observed low-level PCR recombination<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> which produced &#x0201c;barcode swapping&#x0201d;, causing the frequency of these amplification artifacts to be amplified. In essence, a partial amplification product, composed of a CDRH3 and an incomplete VH gene, was able to prime a different antibody sequence and continue amplification, producing a hybrid VH gene. This hybrid amplicon encodes the 3&#x02019; molecular barcode from the primary antibody recombination and the 5&#x02019; molecular barcode from the second. The barcode swapping creates a unique barcode pair, forcing the hybrid sequence to be binned and processed separately. To minimize the effects of such barcode swapping, we binned sequences using only the 3&#x02019; molecular barcode. Because the likelihood of UMI collisions was relatively high given the sequencing depth, the CDRH3 nucleotide sequences of each UMI bin containing more than one sequence were clustered at high identity (90%) and a consensus sequence was computed for each cluster. For UMI bins containing only a single sequence, the lone sequence was used as the representative for the respective UMI bin. Because our sequencing depth was approximately equal to the number of input cells (~3&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> sequencing reads from ~3&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> input B cells), the majority of UMI bins contained only a single sequencing read. As such, the UMIs were not used primarily for error correction, but as a means for correcting differential representation arising from stochastic or primer-driven amplification biases. Mutation frequencies in the IgM and IgG sequence populations (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 3</xref>) provide empirical evidence of a low amplification/sequencing error rate that corroborates sequencer-derived quality metrics.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Germline gene assignment and annotation</title><p id="P18">Adapters and V-gene amplification primers (used for second strand synthesis) were removed using cutadapt.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> cDNA synthesis primers, which anneal to the CH1 region, were not removed because this region is needed to determine the isotype. Sequences were annotated with abstar<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and two output formats were generated: a comprehensive JSON-formatted output, which was imported into a MongoDB database; and a minimal CSV-formatted output, which is tabular and suitable for direct parsing or conversion to Parquet for querying on a Spark cluster.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Antibody clonotypes</title><p id="P19">Antibody clonotypes, defined as a collection of sequences that use the same V and J germline segments and encode an identical CDRH3 amino acid sequence, were used throughout this study to reduce the influence of sequencing or amplification error. Although collapsing the V/J regions to just the germline assignment removes the possibility of double-counting sequences that differ only by error(s) in the V- or J-gene region, it does not eliminate the impact of error in the CDRH3. To gauge the effect of sequencing and amplification error in the CDRH3 on clonotype diversity, we collapsed sequences into clonotypes allowing either no mismatches in the CDRH3 amino acid sequence or allowing a single mismatch in the CDRH3. The total number of 1-mismatch clonotypes was lower than the number of 0-mismatch clonotypes by only 5.9% on average (3.4&#x02013;9.5%), which is as expected when collapsing a sequence population containing expanded antibody lineages (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 5</xref>) and indicates that CDRH3 sequencing errors do not contribute meaningfully to clonotype diversity. Thus, only 0-mismatch clonotypes were used for all further experiments utilizing clonotypes.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Estimation of light chain diversity relative to heavy chain diversity</title><p id="P20">Estimation of light chain diversity is, in some ways, more complex than estimating heavy chain diversity due to the relatively high frequency of coincidentally identical recombinations.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Rather than sequencing unpaired light chains and attempting to discern independent rearrangements from distinct copies of RNA derived from the same recombination event, we leveraged a novel dataset of paired antibody heavy and light chains to estimate the diversity of light chains relative to the diversity of heavy chains.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> For each of the three subjects for which paired heavy/light sequencing data was available, we estimated the total richness using Chao2 and Recon estimators. Each subject was sequenced in duplicate, and separated estimates were computed for each sequencing replicate. Because the sequencing depth was far lower in the paired data set than in the large-scale experiment described here, we extrapolated the richness estimates so that the paired richness estimates were more comparable with the large-scale estimates. Although such an extrapolation may introduce a non-trivial amount of variance into the richness estimates, we believe that this provides the most accurate estimate of relative light chain diversity that is currently available. Diversity estimates and the associated extrapolations can be found in <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 7</xref>. The highest ratio of heavy chain to light chain richness (indicating the lowest diversity of light chains relative to heavy chains) was observed with the Chao2 estimator (3.8&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup>). Conservatively, we rounded this ratio up to the nearest order of magnitude (10<sup>4</sup>) when computing the total paired repertoire diversity estimates.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Generating synthetic repertoires based on a probabilistic model of V(D)J recombination</title><p id="P21">We created a total of 3 billion synthetic antibody sequences using IGoR<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> with one of three different approaches. First, we created 10 sequence batches, each containing 10<sup>8</sup> synthetic antibody sequences, using IGoR&#x02019;s default recombination model, which was inferred from unproductive antibody rearrangements. The reason for using unproductive rearrangements for inferring IGoR&#x02019;s default recombination model is that productive rearrangements are subject to a variety of selection processes during B cell maturation (negative selection of autoreactive clones, requirement for productive pairing with a light chain, etc), whereas unproductive rearrangements are subjected to none of these selection processes. Thus, a model inferred from unproductive rearrangements incorporates only information about the V(D)J recombination process. Second, we inferred subject-specific recombination models using 5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> randomly selected IgM sequences that were entirely unmutated in the V-gene region. Ten synthetic sequence batches, each containing 10<sup>8</sup> sequences, were then generated, one batch per subject. Finally, we inferred a combined-subject recombination model using a pool of 5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> umutated IgM sequences from all 10 subjects (5&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> sequences per subject, randomly selected from the sequences used to generate the subject-specific models). As with IGoR&#x02019;s default model, 10 separate batches of 10<sup>8</sup> synthetic sequences were generated with the combined-subject model. All synthetic sequences were processed in the same manner as the observed antibody sequences, except that the adapter trimming and UMI-based correction steps were not performed. Kullback-Leibler divergence between models or model &#x0201c;events&#x0201d; was computed with the pygor package, which is distributed with IGoR (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 8</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Morisita-Horn similarity</title><p id="P22">Antibody sequences from each subject were reduced to just the V-gene, J-gene and CDRH3 length (VJ-CDR3len) and were randomly sub-sampled with replacement at sample sizes ranging from 10<sup>1</sup>-10<sup>7</sup>.
