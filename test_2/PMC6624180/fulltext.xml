As medicine moves to adopt a more &#x02018;precision&#x02019; approach that integrates individual variability including &#x02018;omics data into risk assessments, diagnoses, and therapeutic decision making, whole transcriptome expression analyses using technologies such as RNA-Seq are poised to become foundational methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Still, there are issues to resolve before this promise can be realized; most related to data analysis and interpretation rather than data collection, though all areas can still be better optimized. Major areas for computational analytical methods improvements include (i) the development of a well-validated reference standard, thoroughly vetted and solidly benchmarked for a given investigation, and (ii) the ability to confidently make individual-level inferences from transcriptomic data.</p><p id="Par16">To the last point, the majority of <italic>differentially expressed gene</italic> (DEG) analysis methods currently available have been designed to make inferences at the population level about diseases or conditions, not for individual patients. These experiments and analytical approaches seek to define and characterize the common and consensus processes that differentiate or underlie two (or more) states. In basic research using model organisms, establishing controls over genotype and experimental parameters allows genotype-level inference by using a two-group comparison with three or more replicates per group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In clinical research using human subjects, however, the genotypic and lived experience diversity of each subject introduces substantial biological variability and noise into expression data. This then requires tens to thousands of genotype-distinct replicate samples to draw inferences about the population(s) and condition(s) of interest, but simultaneously ignores or prohibits individual-level variation and inferences unless they can be classified according to stratification patterns common enough to be noticed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. To adapt the tools designed for populations into tools appropriate for individual-level inference requires either the use of replicates (mimicking the style of a model organism experiment and reducing the cross-sample noise to primarily stochastic and technical factors), a priori distribution and parameter assumptions, or data-derived models to create an expected distribution useful for comparison. However, in practice, it is not cost-effective and often entirely infeasible to obtain replicate samples from clinical procedures. Since DEG analysis methods were validated using replicates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], there remains a need to learn how well a DEG method designed for identifying differential expression would perform in real-world conditions and when replicates are unavailable (ss-DEG Methods).</p><p id="Par17">Novel methodological advances designed with single subjects in mind have begun to be proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. While accurately discovering DEGs between two RNA-Seq samples remains a challenge and insufficiently studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], methods identifying <italic>differentially expressed gene sets and pathways</italic> between two transcriptomes applicable to single-subject studies have been reproducibly demonstrated as feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] in simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], retrospective studies in distinct datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], cellular assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], as well as in one clinical classifier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] ( Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). These comprehensive validations of gene set/pathway-level methods established the feasibility of single-subject interpretation of the transcriptomes and stimulate further investigations to improve more precise methods for determining the underlying differentially expressed genes. However, transcriptional dynamics operating and validated at the gene set or pathway-level cannot straightforwardly be deconvoluted to identify specific transcripts altered in a single subject. A recent study provides a comparison of accuracy for five ss-DEGs methods using computer simulations of several data models with genomic dysregulation ranging from 5 to 40% of DEGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A partial independent biological validation was conducted for one ss-DEG method, NOIseq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], confirming 400 DEG signals by qPCR. Yet, and to the best of our knowledge, no study has comprehensively validated nor compared the accuracies of ss-DEG methods using biological or clinical datasets on a transcriptome scale. In addition, no framework has been proposed on how to conduct such a comprehensive validation.</p><p id="Par18">We and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] propose that there is a knowledge gap in the field with regards to optimizing the operating characteristics of the state-of-the-art RNA-Seq analytics for precision medicine: what are the best ss-DEG methods for interrogating two RNA-Seq samples from one patient taken in two different conditions without replicates? Reliable and accurate of ss-DEG methods can have practical utility. For example, the comparison of affected versus unaffected samples (e.g., cancer versus non-cancer) can provide valuable insight into the genetic variables involved in a disease&#x02019;s pathophysiology and therapeutics. Similarly, using a patient&#x02019;s healthy tissue as its baseline to compare treated tissue or evolution over time provides another framework to design analytics and assays for precision medicine.</p><p id="Par19">We thus designed this study under the following premise: <italic>isogenic (genome matched) biological replicates can provide a framework for testing single-subject methods in the absence of an externally valid reference standard.</italic> In this study, we aim to identify the best-performing techniques and parameters in absence of replicates of distinct single-subject (ss) methods predicting differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In addition, we hypothesized, implemented, and evaluated an ensemble method as possibly more robust across different conditions of application for determining DEGs in single subjects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par20">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> provides an overview of the experimental design, including the methods and recommendation for using an ensemble learner approach to develop robust reference standards in ss studies.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Evaluation strategy of methods designed for transcriptome analysis in paired single subject samples. <italic>Motivation:</italic> Identifying the gene products altered between two conditions in a single subject without replicates (ss-DEGs) is highly relevant in precision medicine.

A dataset comprising multiple biological replicates of isogenic transcriptomes observed on samples taken in distinct biological conditions is identified. Step 2 The replicates are split into two groups of independent samples: a reference set and a single-subject (ss) prediction set. Step 3. Each r-DEG method (e.g., EdgeR, DESeq, etc.) is applied independently to the reference set to generate multiple reference standards, as each method has biases and none can be truly considered as a gold standard (Step 3, top panel). The reference set consists of biological replicates between two conditions of isogenic samples, and is thus a proxy for studying and mimicking the isogenic biologic variation of one subject (and each set of r-DEGs is an attempt at becoming a gold standard. In parallel, each ss-DEG method is applied to independent pairs of samples (one in each condition) taken from the prediction set, each as a proxy to a single subject (Step 3. Bottom panel). Step 4. Accuracy scores are determined for each ss-DEG method against each r-DEG-derived reference standard. Step 5.

To this end, we compared published and novel computational methods designed to detect DEGs from single-subject without replicates (ss) with a variety of well-validated and widely-used RNA-Seq analysis methods designed to identify DEGs from cohort or replicate-based comparisons (r-DEG) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. With the exception of NOISeq that has been directly designed for application to a single subject under two conditions without replicates (NOISeq-sim implementation), the other replicate-based methods (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) have not been designed nor systematically tested for accurate performance in single-subject, paired-sample conditions where replicates are not available. However, for the selected methods, the authors have estimated the required parameters to perform these comparisons, which are included in package documentation. All methods were implemented according to the default parameters provided for isogenic conditions (genotype-replicates) in the original publications. For NOISeq, we used noiseqbio function under their default parameter settings to generate the reference standard, and noiseq-sim (setting the parameters replicates&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0201c;no&#x0201d; and nss&#x02009;=&#x02009;3) for the single-subject studies.

For each DEG method in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, we calculated ss-DEGs for 12 distinct pairs of samples in the Yeast prediction set, and 3 pairs of samples in the MCF7 prediction dataset. We did this by randomly generating pairs across conditions (i.e. selecting a random &#x0201c;WT&#x0201d; to pair with a random &#x0201c;snf-mutant&#x0201d; for Yeast, and &#x0201c;control&#x0201d; paired with &#x0201c;E2&#x0201d; for the MCF7 set) without replacement to ensure independence. Because each sample in the dataset is isogenic to all the others (save the presence/absence of the snf mutation characterizing the two conditions in Yeast), we can use this as a model for replicate pairs drawn from a single subject. As sample replicates drawn from the same individual, cell line, or model organism, they should follow identical distributions &#x02013; with the exception of the DEGs results from the technical and biological errors and those attributable to the designed experimental differences. Of note, while many of the methods were not intended nor validated for ss-DEG calculations, the authors of each of the r-DEG methods (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) did indicate their possible application to two-sample comparisons and provided unpublished approaches to adapt or estimate the parameters required for such processing.

The Precision-Recall and ROC curves across individual samples (Yeast) show that even in isogenic settings, a fair amount of biological variability exists. Furthermore, these single-subject studies provide a thorough comparison of each ss-DEG method&#x02019;s performance and consistency in absence of replicates, allowing us to understand which tools have a greater potential for advancing precision medicine. For example, in the Yeast dataset, under &#x0003e;&#x02009;40 biological replicates, the authors recommended DESeq and DESeq2. However, in absence of biological replicates, these techniques performed overly conservatively (unworkable recalls) and, on average, the worst</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12920_2019_513_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par28">False Discovery Rates (FDRs) were calculated using Benjamini-Yekutieli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] given the dependent structure of the hypothesis tests.

The Yeast case study produced reference standards that predicted between 55 and 70% of the genes in the genome as DEGs, while the MCF7 breast cancer cell lines predicted ~&#x02009;15% DEGs. In <bold>a</bold>, the intersection of all reference standard is used to produce what we would consider an &#x0201c;overtly-conservative&#x0201d; reference. The reference standard was constructed by taking intersection of the DEG lists from cohort analysis of the dataset with DESeq2, DEGSeq, edgeR, NOISeq-BIO (3118 genes as DE). Conversely, in <bold>b</bold>), the reference standard was constructed taking the union of all techniques (6425 genes as DE), resulting in an &#x0201c;anti-conservative&#x0201d; approach. The anti-conservative scenario facilitates the prediction task as a larger number of genes are called DEGs, which is advantageous to recall. In this case, methods like DEGseq stand out as they can maintain recall while not sacrificing precision since it will tend to call more genes as DEGs on average compared to its counterparts. DEGseq also operates invariantly at FDRs of 5&#x02013;20%, making it highly suitable for precision medicine since an FDR of 5% is a default standard in clinical decision-making. In the overly conservative scenario with smaller number of DEGs in the gold standard, a more selective approach will perform better, highlighted in the precision parameter and illustrating the trade-offs available across all the tested techniques. An ensemble provides the analyst a robust trade-off alternative as it can build upon the strengths of all methods, and not suffer the issue of &#x0201c;performing well&#x0201d; in one dataset but not in another. In each panel, methods are ordered according to performance</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12920_2019_513_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig><fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Precision-Recall summary plots in Yeast and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines. These aggregate results were constructed by summarizing precision-recall confidence regions over every ss-DEG evaluation by reporting the best mean values with one standard deviation bars in each direction creating a cross, to create the broadest possible precision-recall combinations. The curves show a spectrum of operating characteristics across techniques, indicating the need for an ensemble-like approach and substantial improvements in ss-DEG. The MCF7 case study produced reference standards that predicted between 15% of the genes in the genome as DEGs, while the Yeast case study produced reference standards that predicted between 55 and 70% of the genes as DEG. The more clinically relevant range of DEGs from the MCF7 reference standard construction introduces a very distinct detection problem where methods like DEGseq result in a large number of False Positive as shown in the precision-recall summary plots. It achieves high recall at the expense of low-precision. Conservative techniques like DESeq obtain a very high precision on a small number of calls. The results show this is a challenging detection task, and that various techniques operate differently, providing an analyst with a wide-range of operating characteristics. In the Yeast dataset, all methods achieve a high precision, with varying levels of recall, however given that the majority of genes are labeled DEGs, this favors methods with high number of calls. Since certain methods can perform well in one scenario and underperform in others, we recommend a contextual use or an ensemble-like approach where the strengths of these tools can be combined into a single, robust predictor. Here, precision and recall of each instance of ss-DEGs are respectively calculated on the union and the intersection of reference standards (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, NOISeq, edgeR, and DESeq were the most concordant and robust methods for creating a reference standard. However, the overall concordance between all methods varies substantially (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). For example, the authors of the original Yeast dataset report ~&#x02009;60% DEGs, while the union of all methods identifies as many as 90% DEGs, but their intersection reports a mere 44%.</p><p id="Par50">Since no single reference standard is fully a statement of truth, nor their union or intersection, we systematically evaluated methods discovering DEGs in two conditions without replicates against all reference standards using the aforementioned &#x0201c;all-against-one&#x0201d; framework. As discussed in the Methods, distinct samples were utilized for calculating the reference standard and for estimating DEGs between paired transcriptomes.

As shown by Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, NOISeq-sim outperformed other tested single-subject techniques in terms of precision across both case studies and was capable of scoring well across a range of cohort-derived reference standards. In contrast, single-subject implementations of DESeq and DESeq2 were highly conservative. In addition, ss-DESeq2 does not perform without replicates, as in our hands, the method predicted zero DEGs when applied to either the Yeast or MCF7 single-subject sets, even though robust responses were noted by both other ss-DEG methods and cohort analyses suggesting a biological signal was present.</p><p id="Par52">In the presence of a true gold standard, the kappa interrater agreement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] could be utilized to compare methods, and precision and recall could be calculated more reliably without the requirement of creating method-specific reference standards. In absence of this, proper validation must be conducted to avoid misrepresenting the accuracy of the attained results. One major statistical issue with the way biological validations are currently conducted is that results typically only show each method evaluated against itself rather than against a true gold or reference standard. For example, in the MCF7 study, edgeR was determined to be the best technique using a reference standard built from edgeR, but not a reference standard built from a consensus. This evaluation better answers the question, &#x0201c;Which technique is best able to recapture the signal identified by their own model?&#x0201d; rather than addressing the biological question, &#x0201c;Which technique can best identify the signal in the data?&#x0201d; Because all these DEG models assume a variety of [count] parametric and non-parametric distributions, different models catch different signals, and it would be na&#x000ef;ve to believe that any one model is superior to address all possible research questions and designs. Therefore, if there is not a clear consensus on which model best captures the biological signal, any evaluation framework must consider an <italic>all-against-one</italic> evaluation or an ensemble approach for a more honest and robust evaluation.</p><p id="Par53">The proposed <italic>all-against-one</italic> experimental setting is akin to a leave-one-out (LOO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] cross-validation set up where instead of leaving out one sample, one method is left out for identifying DEGs, and in order to evaluate it against the remainder (i.e., create reference standards from DEGseq, edgeR, and NOISeq and recapture their DEG calls using DESeq, and then repeat for each individual DEG method). The evaluation graphs in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> show a subset of these individual experiments where edgeR, DEGseq, and NOISeqBio are evaluated in a <italic>all-against-one</italic> approach, with <italic>all</italic> single-subject methods separately making DEG predictions <italic>against</italic> the signal identified by the <italic>one</italic> method used to construct the reference standard. Of note, we propose a conservative framework where a single-subject method is not evaluated against a reference standard built from its related method applied to replicates. In other words, both the data and the method used to build the reference standard are indepdent from the tested single subject method and its data substrate. Curiously, the authors that generated these reference standard datasets and produced evaluations of r-DEG methods, compared these method to a reference built from the same method, likely reporting inflated and biased accuracy rates attributable to their anticonservative evaluation framework. Perplexingly, these authors also reported that distinct r-DEG methods did not agree on the predicted DEGs but did not consider evaluating a method performance using another as a reference standard.</p><p id="Par54">The <italic>ensemble learner</italic> approach follows the school of thought in machine learning that an individual strong classifier (say a decision tree or neural network) is less accurate than a classifier built from aggregating a collection of weaker classifiers since it may risk being unstable. One popular and effective way to build an ensemble is by way of bootstrapping and aggregating individual predictors [or bagging for short] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In decision trees, for example, one carefully pruned decision tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] may be better than any sub-tree in a random forest classifier, but a random forest classifier as a whole (which is built on bootstrap and subsampling theory) will almost surely beat any individually-pruned decision tree as well as have less variability in its predictions. In our study, we translated the <italic>ensemble learner</italic> framework into the single-subject DEG study by aggregating predictions from individual ss-DEG methods (i.e., aggregating edgeR, DEGseq, mixture models, and NOISeq predictions) into a single-subject ensemble (ss-ensemble) method for identifying DEGs.</p><p id="Par55">This proposed <italic>ss-ensemble learner</italic> approach consistently obtained high overall accuracies which suggests that a combination of parameter and distribution assumptions can overcome some of the limitations and biases inherent to any one model, further enabling a more accurate consensus standard (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). We note that one other method, NOISeq, performed nearly as well and could be used interchangeably for the sole use of predicting DEGs in single subjects. Thus, we recommend an ensemble approach over an individual predictor given that the ensemble offers the same precise predictive abilities, but with the added bonus of being robust to multiple distributional assumptions and their violations. Furthermore, the inherent diversity in the individual learners that enter the model (some are nonparametric while others are parametric techniques, and the parametric techniques assume a different set of distributions), enriches the final classifier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and provides a more accurate representation of the true biology, rather than one specific method&#x02019;s statistical representation of it. Therefore, rather than focusing on the advantages and disadvantages of different distributional and parametric assumptions, we believe that all of their strengths can be leveraged if used and evaluated in a comprehensive and conservative framework, like the proposed &#x0201c;all-against-one&#x0201d;. Individual techniques always run the risk of being optimal in one dataset and suboptimal in another, as assumptions may be violated or appropriate on a dataset-to-dataset basis. However, an ensemble and holistic evaluation framework mitigates these risks; though, we are aware that further studies in this direction are required to fully demonstrate this added benefit. Future work will also extend our evaluation of the ensemble framework to include bootstrapping, by sampling isogenic pairs with replacement.</p><p id="Par56">From this study, it also appears that all ss-DEG methods are sensitive to the percentage of DEGs present in the reference set. Given this, the degree of perturbation, or range in number of DEGs expected in a pair of samples, can guide the method selection. The Yeast dataset was utilized due to its large number of replicates for the construction of independent test and validation sets; however, the range of DEGs observed as a consequence of deleting a component of the transcriptional machinery is clearly higher than expected between most paired clinical samples. On the other hand, the MCF7 dataset was limited in term of samples but still provides some insight on DEG ranges of 15&#x02013;30%. We had no datasets to evaluate conditions with DEGs&#x0003c;&#x02009;15%. As simulations and synthetic data can investigate a range of accuracies against a true gold standard, they can be prone to other biases and limitations. Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] have implemented a comprehensive simulation of ss-DEG methods across 8000 tests in a companion study using a range of DEG proportions from 5 to 40%, assuming distinct distributions (Poisson or Negative Binomial) and modeling a variable mean to variance relationship observed from real datasets as recommended by McCarthy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The results from those simulations broadly agree with the results obtained in this study, identifying the same precision and recall rankings between NOISeq-sim, edgeR, DESeq, and DEGSeq when used with replicates to construct the reference standard. In contrast, however, simulation studies generally yielded higher recall estimates, suggesting that the observed residual cross-replicate heterogeneity comprised of non-genomic and stochastic variation of real biologic datasets can substantially limit performance of the DEG methods applied to two conditions without replicates. Due to this, we suggest that these methods&#x02019; performance should be viewed as a range or spectrum, rather than definite.</p><p id="Par57">The union of the reference standards provides 90% DEGs, suggesting that our framework illustrates how anticonservative the accuracy rates reported in studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] are, as each method was evaluated against itself in these previous studies. While 90% of DEG is biologically unrealistic, it wholly illustrates the extent to which all DEG methods disagree. Conversely, we also provide a conservative reference standard (intersection of methods). This again can produce extremely low percentage of DEG calls and is sensitive to the choice of algorithms used. These extremes show the need for a more robust and consistent framework for reference standards akin to that of an ensemble approach or the &#x0201c;all-against-one&#x0201d;; it also provides a lower and upper bound of DEG calls that can be expected in any biological study in order to best study the characteristics of the methods and data being analyzed. We propose using the &#x0201c;all-against-one&#x0201d; framework for future studies and the use of an ensemble to mitigate these challenges.</p><p id="Par58">Based on the results shown in Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, we report in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> recommendations for the use of ss-DEGs in two conditions without replicates.

This may be due to those authors calculating the accuracy of their r-DEG methods in the presence of replicates using anti-conservative conditions: each method was compared to itself using the total number of replicates, while substudies utilized a random sample within those utilized for the reference standard. Here, our accuracies are more conservatively calculated in two ways: (i) we constructed each reference standard by using distinct samples for predictions without predicates from the reference standard construction, and (ii) the accuracy scores of a method predicting DEGs without replicates were tested against reference standards built by distinct methods in replicates.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>ss-DEG Methods Recommendations: Single-subject studies of two-sample conditions without replicates</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"/><th colspan="16">Combinations of accuracies</th></tr><tr><th colspan="12">15%&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;DEGs &#x0003c;&#x02009;30%</th><th colspan="4">55%&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;DEGs &#x0003c;&#x02009;70%</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Precision (%)&#x02192;</td><td colspan="4">&#x0003e;&#x02009;90%</td><td colspan="4">&#x0003e;&#x02009;70%</td><td colspan="4">50</td><td colspan="4">&#x0003e;&#x02009;90%</td></tr><tr><td>Recall&#x02192; (&#x0003e;%)</td><td>90</td><td>70</td><td>50</td><td>25</td><td>90</td><td>70</td><td>50</td><td>25</td><td>90</td><td>70</td><td>50</td><td>25</td><td>90</td><td>70</td><td>50</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td colspan="17">Methods</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Ensemble</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;NOISeq</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;DEGseq</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Mixture Model</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;edgeR</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;iDEG</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;DESeq</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02713;</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;DESeq2</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td><td>&#x02717;</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>&#x02713;&#x000a0;=&#x02009;recommended; &#x02717; = not recommended</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="Par59">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a shows how DEGseq performs similarly to NOISeq and the ensemble method maintains precision at FDR 5% and properly detects nearly 75% of the DEGs. One could argue this combination would potentially make DEGseq the ideal tool for this dataset; however, in the MCF7 case study, DEGseq could not replicate its performance (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). This highlights the risks of relying on a single technique across distinct DEG proportions. Furthermore, under multiple biological replicates, techniques like DESeq, DESeq2, and edgeR are the staples of RNA-Seq data analysis and are often the authors&#x02019; default method choices and recommendations for building reference standards. However, as seen in Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, DESeq and DESeq2 performed overly conservatively in the two datasets (extremely low recalls), showing that their reliability does extend to single-subject (without replicate) conditions. This study provides a promising first comparison of how RNA-Seq analysis techniques fare in comparing two conditions in absence of replicates (one sample per condition). In addition, ranges of DEGs&#x0003c;&#x02009;15% - that were not explored here - also merit to be explored as they are likely clinically relevant in response to therapy. The addition of more datasets with additional response ranges would further improve our understanding of the accuracy of ss-DEG methods, especially when these datasets are previously validated, as was the case of the MCF7 and Yeast datasets. Furthermore, improvement of ss-DEGs methods is required, particularly for performing with higher recall when DEGs are low. Further studies are also needed to describe the effectiveness of better performing methods, such as NOISeq (specifically NOISeq-sim), in the absence of replicates across different contexts.</p><p id="Par60">In the past, comparing a transcriptome to heterogenic samples from other subjects has been proposed. However, this strategy brings up a number of confounding factors: distinct genetics, distinct environmental factors, etc. Here, we proposed using one&#x02019;s own samples as controls. Adding biological replicates increases accuracy and is recommended where possible, but may not be feasible in certain clinical settings and can be cost prohibitive. In the absence of replicates, focusing on identifying those DEGs within differentially expressed pathways may further improve the accuracy rates and also merits validation in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par61">This study demonstrates that determining differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two conditions of one subject in absence of replicate samples (two samples total) can be obtained with high precision and limited recall (&#x0003c;&#x02009;30%) when the true number of DEGs ranges from 15 to 30%, while a few methods can also provide reliable results under conditions where the proportion of DEGs exceed 50% of the genome. No single-subject ss-DEG method obtained both high precision and recall in the evaluations using these biological datasets, though some obtained a reasonably robust F1-score.</p><p id="Par62">As RNA-Seq technologies expand the opportunities to analyze single-subject data, more time and research need to focus on a greater understanding of which analysis tools are better suited for clinical samples and individual inferences. At the moment, the limited access to a sufficient quantity of clinically relevant tissues typically prohibits replicate sampling. Thus, conventional analystical methods that require replicates to determine DEGs must be adapted or replaced in order to advance the utility of transcriptome profiling in precision medicine. This study demonstrates that ongoing improvements in single-subject methods are required for these to work robustly and accurately in absence of replicates. We have also shown that the biological and data characteristics of RNA-seq are also critical factors that affects method performance, as the relative strengths and limitations of each method differed markedly depending on the proportion of DEGs regulated by the bioassay. However, ensemble methods for single-subject analyses enabled consistent performance regardless of the studied conditions.</p><p id="Par63">Further, it still remains difficult to generate consensus reference standards from different RNA-seq analysis tools as the intersection of all well-established methods agreed on less than 50% of called DEGs, even when implementing these tools under their recommended conditions with replicate samples in well-studied datasets. Previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] have shown the translation value obtained from using single sample data for clinical phenotyping, thus we must continue expanding the methodology and framework along this direction. In order to improve the accuracy, we propose that future methods consider the injection of knowledge from curated gene set (e.g., Gene Ontology) and network science (e.g., unbiased gene set obtained from co-expression networks) to pool the signal of altered genes belonging to functional units as a way to increase signal accuracy and reliability in single subjects While the reductionism of identifying directly DEGs from stwo samples is appealing, previous systems genomics work, showing stronger signals at differentially expressed pathways in single-subject studies, suggests combining the two approaches would substantially increase DEG accuracies.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AUC</term><def><p id="Par5">Area under the curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DEG</term><def><p id="Par6">Differentially expressed genes</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FDR</term><def><p id="Par7">False discovery rate (specifically, BY)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PR</term><def><p id="Par8">Precision-recall</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>r-DEG</term><def><p id="Par9">Methods based to determine DEGs between two conditions using replicates in each condition</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ROC</term><def><p id="Par10">Receiver-operator characteristics</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par11">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ss</term><def><p id="Par12">Single-Subject</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ss-DEG</term><def><p id="Par13">Methods based to determine DEGs between two conditions without replicates in each condition (two samples total)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WT</term><def><p id="Par14">Wild type</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Qike Li for providing access to his iDEG program, PhD Thesis, and manuscript under review.
