Alternative mechanisms for the anti-cancer effects of TH588 have been suggested but the question remains unresolved. Here, we performed an unbiased CRISPR screen on human lung cancer cells to identify potential mechanisms behind the cytotoxic effect of TH588. The screen identified pathways and complexes involved in mitotic spindle regulation. Using immunofluorescence and live cell imaging, we showed that TH588 rapidly reduced microtubule plus-end mobility, disrupted mitotic spindles, and prolonged mitosis in a concentration-dependent but MTH1-independent manner. These effects activated a USP28-p53 pathway &#x02013; the mitotic surveillance pathway &#x02013; that blocked cell cycle reentry after prolonged mitosis; USP28 acted upstream of p53 to arrest TH588-treated cells in the G1-phase of the cell cycle. We conclude that TH588 is a microtubule-modulating agent that activates the mitotic surveillance pathway and thus prevents cancer cells from re-entering the cell cycle.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Target validation</kwd><kwd>Targeted therapies</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100006636</institution-id><institution>Forskningsr&#x000e5;det om H&#x000e4;lsa, Arbetsliv och V&#x000e4;lf&#x000e4;rd (Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100002794</institution-id><institution>Cancerfonden (Swedish Cancer Society)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001729</institution-id><institution>Stiftelsen f&#x000f6;r&#x000a0;Strategisk Forskning (Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse (Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100006313</institution-id><institution>Barncancerfonden (Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>ALF-projektmedel</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The mut-T homolog 1 (MTH1, also known as NUDT1) inhibitor TH588 has shown promise as an anticancer compound in preclinical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

Centrosomes duplicate during the S phase of the cell cycle, migrate to opposite cell poles during the prophase of mitosis, and organize bipolar spindles during the metaphase. To assess whether TH588 interferes with any of these processes, we investigated centrosome numbers and spindle morphology of mitotic cells in unsynchronized cell cultures. TH588 had no effect on centrosome duplication (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2A</xref>) but decreased the separation of duplicated centrosomes in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A,B</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2B</xref>).

Prolonged metaphase was coincidental with lagging chromosomes, suggesting that TH588 activated the spindle checkpoint. The delay was temporary and most cells eventually segregated their chromosomes and exited mitosis. However, at high concentrations of TH588, the majority of cells were permanently arrested in metaphase, or exited mitosis without division (mitotic slippage) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). Flow cytometry of 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU)-labeled cells confirmed that TH588 treatment led to accumulation of cells at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2F,G</xref>), in agreement with increased mitotic duration and metaphase arrest.</p><p id="Par10">We next tested the possibility that TH588 targets microtubules or microtubule dynamics by generating cells expressing the microtubule plus-end labeling EB1-GFP reporter (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>).

Similar experiments with cells expressing a tubulin-GFP fusion protein showed that TH588 reduced microtubule dynamics without altering microtubule filament density (Supplementary Movie&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">6</xref>). We conclude that TH588, by decreasing microtubule dynamics, disrupts assembly of bipolar spindles and chromosome congression in mitotic cells, thus causing metaphase arrest and prolonged mitoses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>TH588 disrupts mitotic spindles independently of MTH1</title><p id="Par11">The mechanism we propose for the cytotoxic effect of TH588 differs from the original proposal, namely inhibition of MTH1-mediated sanitation of the nucleotide pool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, but it remains possible that inhibition of MTH1 contributes to the drug effect.

The screen identified a densely connected network of pathways and complexes involved in mitotic spindle regulation, suggesting that TH588 directly or indirectly targets mitotic spindles. In support of this, we show that TH588 concentration-dependently: (1) decreased centrosome separation in mitotic cells, (2) increased the occurrence of monopolar spindles and lagging chromosomes, (3) increased mitotic duration and mitotic slippage, and (4) markedly decreased microtubule dynamics. Importantly, TH588 affected mitotic spindles and microtubule dynamics at the same concentrations that decreased growth and viability of cancer cells in this and other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">While it may seem counterintuitive that inactivation of important regulators of spindle formation promoted growth of TH588-treated cells, positive selection in drug-gene interaction screens could have many underpinnings.

Hence, inactivation of spindle regulators may precondition cells to tolerate TH588 better compared to other cells in the mutant cell pool.</p><p id="Par19">Although we have shown that TH588 is a microtubule-modulating agent, we have not identified its direct target(s). TH588 reduced microtubule dynamics within minutes of drug administration, excluding mechanisms that require transcription, translation, or accumulation of slow-forming metabolites. Moreover, TH588 reduced microtubule dynamics during the interphase of the cell cycle, thus arguing against targets that are confined to the mitotic apparatus, and without disrupting microtubule filaments, suggesting that it may belong to the &#x0201c;kinder and gentler&#x0201d; category of microtubule-modulating agents including noscapinoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. These gentler agents are expected to have less adverse effects than other tubulin-targeting agents.</p><p id="Par20">The mode of action we propose for the cytotoxic effect of TH588 differs from that proposed originally, namely that TH588, by targeting MTH1 and the degradation of oxidized nucleotides, induced replication stress and DNA damage signaling via ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Of note, gRNAs targeting <italic>ATM</italic> were not enriched in our screen, and knockout of <italic>MTH1</italic> neither recapitulated nor attenuated the effect of TH588 on cell growth or mitotic spindle assembly. We conclude therefore that targeting MTH1 is not sufficient or required to reduce microtubule dynamics; however, we cannot exclude the possibility that MTH1 inhibition and accumulation of oxidized nucleotides contribute to TH588&#x02019;s anticancer effect <italic>in vivo</italic>. Indeed, the anticancer effects of other microtubule-modulating agents including vinca alkaloids and taxanes are potentiated by oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">Our results are consistent with those of an earlier study that investigated alternative mechanisms of TH588 and showed that: (1) TH588-treated cells had a proteomic profile that resembled those generated by tubulin-modulating drugs, (2) TH588 arrested cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, and (3) TH588 inhibited tubulin polymerization in a cell-free system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The latter finding is important because it suggests that TH588 interacts directly with tubulin polymers. Decreased tubulin polymerization required substantially higher concentrations of TH588 (10&#x02013;30&#x02009;&#x000b5;M)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> than those affecting centrosome separation, spindle assembly, chromosome congression, and mitotic duration in our study (1&#x02013;2&#x02009;&#x000b5;M).

A substantial proportion of these cells were arrested at the G1 phase of the cell cycle and thus were prevented from re-entering the cell cycle. Thus, the major growth-limiting mechanism of TH588 is p53-dependent G1 arrest. However, sustained exposure to TH588 and stalled mitosis may lead to other irremediable outcomes that do not require p53. In line with this, TH588 is toxic to several cancer cell lines with validated p53 mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par25">One weakness of this study is the use of gRNA libraries that targeted cell cycle and kinase genes only.

However, the manufacture of these often natural or semi-synthetic compounds is laborious and expensive, and their use is restricted by adverse effects and resistance development. Novel synthetic microtubule-modulating agents, such as TH588, which is well tolerated in mice, are therefore highly requested and expected to complement existing chemotherapies. Controversies regarding the validity of MTH1 as a cancer drug target should not stand in the way of future clinical development of TH588 or its structural homologs.</p><p id="Par27">In summary, we performed an unbiased CRISPR screen to identify pharmacological mechanisms of the MTH1-inhibitor TH588.
