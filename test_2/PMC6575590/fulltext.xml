Some RNAs in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, yeast, and mammals were recently found to contain an NAD<sup>+</sup> cap. Here, we report the development of the method NAD tagSeq for transcriptome-wide identification and quantification of NAD<sup>+</sup>-capped RNAs (NAD-RNAs). The method uses an enzymatic reaction and then a click chemistry reaction to label NAD-RNAs with a synthetic RNA tag. The tagged RNA molecules can be enriched and directly sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore sequencing technology. NAD tagSeq can allow more accurate identification and quantification of NAD-RNAs, as well as reveal the sequences of whole NAD-RNA transcripts using single-molecule RNA sequencing. Using NAD tagSeq, we found that NAD-RNAs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> were produced by at least several thousand genes, most of which are protein-coding genes, with the majority of these transcripts coming from &#x0003c;200 genes. For some <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes, over 5% of their transcripts were NAD capped. Gene ontology terms overrepresented in the 2,000 genes that produced the highest numbers of NAD-RNAs are related to photosynthesis, protein synthesis, and responses to cytokinin and stresses. The NAD-RNAs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> generally have the same overall sequence structures as the canonical m<sup>7</sup>G-capped mRNAs, although most of them appear to have a shorter 5&#x02032; untranslated region (5&#x02032; UTR).

This cap protects the mRNA from decay by 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; exonucleases, as well as plays an essential role in almost all aspects of gene expression by acting as a unique identifier when recruiting proteins for transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, polyadenylation, nuclear transport, and protein synthesis initiation (for reviews, see refs. <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>It was once thought that prokaryotic RNAs lack a 5&#x02032; cap. Several years ago, an NAD<sup>+</sup> moiety was found to be covalently linked to the 5&#x02032; end of some RNAs in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), although the identities of these NAD<sup>+</sup>-capped RNAs (NAD-RNAs) were unknown. A method termed NAD captureSeq was developed for the identification of NAD-RNAs (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In this method, the nicotinamide moiety of NAD in NAD-RNAs is replaced by an alkyne through a reaction catalyzed by adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosyl cyclase (ADPRC). The resulting &#x0201c;clickable&#x0201d; products react with biotin azide through an azide&#x02013;alkyne cycloaddition reaction. Biotinylated RNAs can then be captured by a streptavidin resin. The enriched RNAs can be used to produce a cDNA library for identification and quantification of NAD-RNAs using second-generation sequencing technology. Using this method, 29 mRNAs and 15 noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) were found to be NAD capped in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The NAD captureSeq method was recently used to identify at least 20 NAD-RNAs in yeast and a much wider range of NAD-RNAs in mammals (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>NAD-RNAs can be synthesized when RNA polymerase incorporates NAD as the first nucleotide, in place of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), during transcription initiation (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), although NAD capping might also occur posttranscriptionally (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, the molecular and physiological functions of NAD-RNAs remain unclear.</p><p>The NAD captureSeq method (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) has some shortcomings. Nonspecific binding of RNAs to the streptavidin resin might lead to false positives and reduced sensitivity. RNA fragmentation introduced during the click chemistry reaction and sequencing library construction can cause loss of information concerning the overall sequence structures of NAD-RNAs. Recently, another method, termed CapZyme-seq, was used to identify NAD-RNAs and other noncanonical initiating nucleotides (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In this method, RNA extracts are treated with an NAD-RNA decapping enzyme. The decapped RNAs can then be ligated to a linker to make a library for sequencing. One shortcoming of CapZyme-seq is that an NAD-RNA decapping enzyme might have substrate specificity such that the method might identify only a subset of NAD-RNAs. In addition, partially degraded RNAs might ligate to the linker, producing false positives.</p><p>Here, we report the development of a high-throughput method termed NAD tagSeq for the accurate identification and quantification of NAD-RNAs.

In the ADPRC negative control, no such ligation product was detected.</p><p>The typical experimental workflow of the NAD tagSeq method shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref> can be varied for the generation of different types of information about cellular NAD-RNAs. For example, to identify and quantify NAD-RNAs among poly(A)-containing RNAs, a poly(A) enrichment step could be carried out before the tagging step. To identify total NAD-RNAs, including those without a native poly(A) tail, polyadenylation of total RNA would have to be performed, since RNAs without a poly(A) tail cannot be sequenced by the current Oxford Nanopore sequencing method. Including a step in which tagged NAD-RNAs are enriched by hybridization to a cDNA probe would increase the sequencing coverage of NAD-RNAs. If the enrichment step is not implemented, both tagged and untagged RNAs could be sequenced, allowing comparison of the relative abundance of NAD-RNAs and their total transcripts, although this approach would reduce the sequencing depth of NAD-RNAs. Different tagRNAs might be used as barcodes for multiplex sequencing. We used a 40-nt RNA-azide molecule (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1903683116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, <italic>Supplementary Methods</italic></ext-link>) as the tagRNA in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>NAD-RNAs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Are Mostly Produced from Protein-Coding Nuclear Genes.</title><p>We carried out transcriptome-wide identification of NAD-RNAs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. To determine which types of RNAs might be NAD capped, total RNA samples from 12-d-old <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings were subjected to the tagging process. A polyadenylation step was carried out using a poly(A) polymerase after the tagging step. Oligo (dT) beads were then used to increase the proportion of poly(A)-containing RNAs and remove excess free tagRNAs. Tagged RNAs were enriched by hybridization to the DNA probe.

The most abundant reads were rRNA molecules, suggesting that a poly(A) tail was added to a large portion of RNAs which lacked a native poly(A) tail. From the ADPRC+ sample, 917 reads were found to be NAD-RNAs. These reads mapped to 192 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1903683116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new">Dataset S1</ext-link>), including 188 protein-coding genes and 4 nonprotein-coding genes. From the ADPRC&#x02212; sample, 2 reads were found to contain tagRNA, suggesting the presence of a low level of noise from the use of this method. The most abundant NAD-RNAs were from AT5G38410, which encodes a Rubisco small subunit. The NAD-RNA reads from nonprotein-coding genes included 2 ncRNA genes: 1 long noncoding (lnc) gene, and 1 read from a chloroplast rRNA gene. Among the NAD-RNAs from protein-coding genes, one was from a mitochondrial gene, ATMG01360, which encodes cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase subunit 1, and the others from nuclear genes.</p><p>The sequencing depth for both NAD-RNA reads and total reads was low when the total RNA samples were used. Nevertheless, the results reported above indicate that NAD-RNAs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> are produced primarily from protein-coding nuclear genes. The sequencing coverage was considerably improved when poly(A) RNAs were subjected to the NAD tagSeq analysis (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>NAD-RNAs Generally Contain a Poly(A) Tail and Are Produced from at Least Several Thousand Protein-Coding Genes.</title><p>The NAD-RNAs from the protein-coding nuclear genes (and possibly also the noncoding nuclear genes) identified in the total RNA tagging experiment are probably transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Because RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase II are generally polyadenylated, we reasoned that most NAD-RNAs are also polyadenylated.</p><p>In the next experiment, poly(A)-containing RNAs were enriched and subjected to the tagging process.

From 3 ADPRC+ samples, we identified a total of 710,098 NAD-RNA reads, which were derived from over 10,000 different genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1903683116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new">Dataset S2</ext-link>). Over 95% of the NAD-RNAs identified in the total RNA tagging experiment were also identified in the poly(A) RNA tagging experiment. The above results further indicated that most <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> NAD-RNAs contain a poly(A) tail.</p><p>In the negative control, 4,623 reads from the 3 replicates were found to contain the tagRNA sequence. The low level of noise might have been due to nonspecific ligation of tagRNA to non&#x02013;NAD-RNAs, probably during the click chemistry reaction. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1903683116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new">Dataset S2</ext-link> lists the NAD-RNAs identified from each sample, including those from the negative control. Among all of the NAD-RNA reads, over 60% were produced from fewer than 200 genes. We calculated transcripts per million reads (TPMs) for each sample to normalize the read counts. NAD-RNAs from 6,486 genes had the TPM value differing by 3 or more in the comparison between the ADPRC+ sample and the ADPRC&#x02212; sample.

The occurrence of the noncanonical NAD cap shows that RNA capping and decapping is more complex than previously assumed.</p><p>Identifying NAD-RNAs and revealing their structural features are essential steps toward understanding the functions of the NAD cap. The NAD tagSeq method allows more accurate identification and quantification of NAD-RNAs than previous methods. Furthermore, it can reveal the sequences of whole NAD-RNA transcripts. Using NAD tagSeq, we found that NAD-RNAs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> were produced from at least several thousand genes, mostly protein-coding nuclear genes.</p><p>Most of the NAD-RNAs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> appear to have a 5&#x02032; end mapped to a region downstream of the annotated TSS, raising the possibility that an alternative promoter might be used for transcriptional initiation for some NAD-RNAs. Other than their shorter 5&#x02032; UTR, the NAD-RNAs have the same nucleotide sequences as their m<sup>7</sup>G-RNA counterparts and usually include all coding sequences, suggesting that they could be translated. This notion is supported by the findings reported in PNAS by Wang et al. (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> NAD-RNAs are preferentially associated with the polysomal fraction under active translation. For m<sup>7</sup>G-RNAs, the cap recruits the nuclear cap binding complex, which mediates pre-mRNA splicing, polyadenylation, nuclear transport, and translation initiation (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The way in which NAD-mRNAs can be processed like m<sup>7</sup>G-mRNAs and transported to the cytosol for translation remains to be determined. As NAD-mRNAs generally share the same sequences as m<sup>7</sup>G-mRNAs and have a shorter 5&#x02032; UTR, it also raises the possibility that for some NAD-mRNAs, the NAD cap could be added posttranscriptionally, perhaps following decapping of m<sup>7</sup>G-mRNAs.</p><p>The mechanisms by which NAD-RNAs regulate gene expression also remain unclear. Among the top 2,000 NAD-RNA&#x02013;producing genes, 1,712 were also identified using NAD captureSeq by Wang et al. (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1903683116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new">Dataset S3</ext-link>). It appears that transcripts from these 2,000 NAD-RNA&#x02013;producing genes are more stable than the average over all transcripts. In addition, proteins from these genes are apparently relatively abundant, suggesting that NAD-RNAs might enhance the expression of the corresponding genes. These 2,000 NAD-RNA&#x02013;producing genes are highly enriched in the GO terms related to photosynthesis, translational processes, and responses to cytokinin and stresses (oxidative stress and other stresses). NAD-RNAs could be involved in cellular energy and redox homeostasis. It is plausible that NAD-RNA levels might be modulated by cellular NAD levels or the NAD/NADH ratio, both of which are affected by environmental conditions and cellular energy status. NAD-RNAs could act as a signal to mediate cellular responses to environmental and intracellular cues. The NAD tagSeq method provides a very useful tool for comparing cellular NAD-RNA profiles under different environmental conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s10"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s11"><title>Plant Growth Conditions.</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Col-0 seeds were germinated on solid half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium with 1% sucrose.
