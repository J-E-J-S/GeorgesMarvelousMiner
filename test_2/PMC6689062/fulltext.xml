This non-natural pathway extends a previously published synthetic pathway for the synthesis of (L)-2,4-dihydroxybutyrate (L-DHB) from malate by three additional reaction steps catalyzed respectively, by a DHB dehydrogenase, a 2-keto-4-hydroxybutyrate (OHB) dehydrogenase and a PDO oxidoreductase. Screening and structure-guided protein engineering provided a (L)-DHB dehydrogenase from the membrane-associated (L)-lactate dehydrogenase of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and OHB decarboxylase variants derived from the branched-chain keto-acid decarboxylase encoded by <italic>kdcA</italic> from <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> or pyruvate decarboxylase from <italic>Zymomonas mobilis</italic>. The simultaneous overexpression of the genes encoding these enzymes together with the endogenous <italic>ydhD</italic>-encoded aldehyde reductase enabled PDO biosynthesis from (L)-DHB. While the simultaneous expression of the six enzymatic activities in a single engineered <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain resulted in a low production of 0.1 mM PDO from 110 mM glucose, a 40-fold increased PDO titer was obtained by co-cultivation of an <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain expressing the malate-DHB pathway with another strain harboring the DHB-to-PDO pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Biotechnology</kwd><kwd>Metabolic engineering</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">A central goal of the bioeconomy consists in reducing our dependence on petroleum by focusing on the development of efficient, sustainable and eco-friendly processes for production of bio-based chemicals and fuels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. 1,3-Propanediol (PDO) is an important commodity chemical that can serve as a precursor monomer for the synthesis of industrially relevant polymers, including polyesters, polyethers and polyurethanes. Among those, the polyester polytrymethylene terephthalate (PTT) is foreseen as a major competitor of Nylon in carpet industries, therefore making PDO a molecule of significant industrial interest. While both acrolein hydration, and ethylene oxide hydroformylation followed by reduction of resulting aldehyde enable PDO synthesis, low product yields and harsh reaction conditions impede the successful development of a cost-competitive chemical production process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Alternatively, PDO can be produced from glycerol by <italic>Klebsiella</italic>, <italic>Clostridium</italic>, <italic>Citrobacter</italic>, <italic>Enterobacter</italic> or <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species under anaerobic conditions in a two-step reductive pathway that employs vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent glycerol dehydratase and PDO oxidoreductase enzymatic activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. More recently, the occurrence of a vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-independent glycerol dehydratase in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>butyricum</italic> (Cb-DhaB1) has also been demonstrated and employed for PDO biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. PDO biosynthesis from glycerol has previously been shown to be extremely efficient. For instance, batch cultivation of <italic>K</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> enabled the production of up to 60 g L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> PDO at a high formation rate (1.4 g L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and good yield (0.35 g PDO per g glycerol)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. A particularity of the PDO pathway starting from glycerol is that product yield remains dependent on the intracellular availability of the NADH co-factor. While anaerobic cell growth on glycerol (oxidative pathway) ensures NADH formation, co-factor regeneration needs the additional formation of a by-product to serve as electron sink (e.g. acetate, butyrate, ethanol, butanol). Together with the fact that glycerol dehydratases are inhibited by the presence of substrate/product at elevated concentration, titre and production rates of PDO to be achieved are limited unless newly discovered or engineered enzymes are found to be less sensitive to the substrate/product couple<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In attempt to demonstrate additional entry points for PDO production and overcome the potential challenges imposed by glycerol fermentation, various strategies were developed to synthesize PDO from sugar feedstock. While no natural microorganisms have been found to directly convert sugars to PDO, the adoption of two-stage and co-fermentation processes was shown to enable a better control of cultivation conditions and a wider flexibility in terms of substrate utilization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Another approach is the engineering of microorganisms for the direct production of PDO from sugars via glycerol, which led Genencor and DuPont to develop a fermentation process employing a genetically modified <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain able to produce PDO aerobically at high titer and yield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In both cases, the engineered PDO pathways are composed of the necessary reaction steps linking the glycolysis-derived metabolite dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to PDO via glycerol (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>), thereby increasing the theoretical product yield by 50% (1.5 mol PDO per mol glucose) when compared to the utilization of glycerol as carbon source. While in the last decade glycerol costs dropped considerably reaching prices which today are inferior to that of glucose, the main advantage of glucose-based processes is the substantially increased product titers and rates as in theory glycerol is not accumulated at high-titers and glycerol dehydratases become no longer rate-limiting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Natural (<bold>A</bold>) and engineered metabolic pathways (<bold>B</bold>&#x02013;<bold>D</bold>) enabling biosynthesis of 1,3-propanediol (PDO).

In this regard, an artificial pathway enabling PDO to be synthesized from glucose or sucrose was previously implemented in <italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic> by extending the naturally occurring aspartate-homoserine pathway (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). The proposed pathway has a similar theoretical product yield than that of Dupont&#x02019; route and does neither involve glycerol as intermediate nor the utilization of glycerol dehydratase enzymes, and is therefore very appealing for PDO production. This approach, which has been patented by METEX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, involves an enzyme bearing amino transferase activity on homoserine, followed by the decarboxylation of 2-keto-4-hydroxybutyrate (OHB) by a keto-acid decarboxylase, and finally the reduction of hydroxypropanal (3-HPA) to PDO by an enzyme with 1,3-propanediol oxidoreductase activity. While the last reaction of this artificial pathway is catalyzed by the broad substrate range NADPH-dependent aldehyde reductase encoded by <italic>yqhD</italic> gene from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (Ec-<italic>yqhD</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, the two preceding enzymatic reactions are not known to naturally occur in cell metabolism. In demonstration of this pathway, these authors have engineered an <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain overexpressing the native <italic>serC</italic>-encoded transaminase (Ec-SerC) and the branched-chain 2-ketoisovalerate decarboxylase from <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> (Ll-KivD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In a complementary study, the poorly effective homoserine transaminase in this pathway has been replaced by a homoserine dehydrogenase obtained by rational engineering of either an <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> NADP-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> or Ec-SerC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, PDO titer obtained with these engineered enzymes was still in the range of mg per liter, suggesting that the deamination of homoserine is rate limiting in the pathway.</p><p id="Par5">To overcome this problem and propose an new alternative pathway for PDO synthesis from glucose, we took advantage of our recent synthetic pathway leading to the production the non-natural metabolite (L)-2,4-dihydroxybutyrate (L-DHB) that departs from the TCA cycle intermediate malate through three non-natural enzymatic reaction steps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. As described in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>, malate is converted to malyl-phosphate by employing malate kinase, followed by a malate semialdehyde dehydrogenase and then malate semialdehyde reductase activities to yield L-DHB. Extending this pathway with (L)-DHB dehydrogenase, OHB decarboxylase and PDO oxidoreductase shall eventually produce PDO. Our proposed pathway has a theoretical product yield identical to other PDO pathways starting from glucose (1.5 mol per mol glucose), and consumes 1 mol of ATP and 3 mol of NADPH per consumed mol of malate, being well suited for aerobic based-processes. Based on enzyme screening and engineering approaches, the required enzyme activities were improved and found to enable <italic>in vivo</italic> PDO production from DHB.

While DHB can be transformed to the methionine-analog HMTB by chemical means<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, we herein demonstrate that this non-natural metabolite may also serve as a precursor for the microbial production of PDO. The conversion of (L)-DHB to PDO proceeds via three reaction steps (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>): (L)-DHB is first oxidized to OHB, the resulting &#x003b1;-keto acid is then decarboxylated to yield 3-HPA, which is finally reduced into PDO. These reactions are catalyzed by enzymes bearing (L)-DHB dehydrogenase, OHB decarboxylase and PDO oxidoreductase activities, respectively. The negative standard Gibbs free energy for the proposed pathway attests its thermodynamic feasibility (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> and Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> in Supplementary Information). Stoichiometric analysis of the metabolic network in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> shows that PDO can be produced from glucose with a theoretical maximum yield of 1.5 mol mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in the absence of cell growth (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> and Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> in Supplementary information). The theoretical yield of PDO is similar to those from glucose via homoserine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and via glycerol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Implementation of the pathway requires enzymes bearing the three constitutive enzymatic activities. The promiscuous broad range aldehyde reductase encoded by <italic>yqhD</italic> in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> was previously shown to catalyze the reduction of 3-HPA to PDO Jarboe, 2011 #9565}, and was therefore used in our work. The <italic>Zymomonas mobilis</italic> pyruvate decarboxylase was found to exhibit OHB decarboxylase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, while to the best of our knowledge no natural (L)-DHB dehydrogenase activity has been reported to date.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Engineering of (L)-DHB dehydrogenase activity</title><p id="Par7">In a recent work, we showed that the soluble NAD-dependent (L)-malate dehydrogenase enzyme variant from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> Ec-Mdh-5Q (I12V:R81Q:M85Q:D86S:G179D) was able to oxidize DHB into OHB as substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, the unfavorable thermodynamics of NAD-dependent DHB oxidation (&#x00394;<sub>r</sub>G<sup>0</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15.7 kJ mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) together with the low affinity of this enzyme variant for (D/L)-DHB (K<sub>m</sub>&#x02009;~&#x02009;130 mM) prompted us to screen for alternative DHB dehydrogenase candidate enzymes. Remarkably, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> MG1655 wild-type cells were found to possess the capability to assimilate 20% of 50 mM (D/L)-DHB after 24h of cultivation in mineral medium (data not shown). The identification of enzymes responsible for this assimilation of DHB dehydrogenase was therefore investigated. In particular, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> displays a set of three lactate dehydrogenase enzymes able to catalyze the interconversion between L- and D-lactate and pyruvate encoded by <italic>ldhA</italic>, <italic>llDd</italic>, <italic>dld</italic> genes. The Ec-LldD and LlldD enzyme relies on FMN and FAD-dependent co-factor system, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, which allow the oxidation of lactate (&#x00394;<sub>r</sub>G<sup>0</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;23.1 kJ mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> in Supplementary information). Since the deletion of the corresponding <italic>lldD</italic> gene in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> nearly abolished DHB consumption (less than 1% consumption after 24h of cell cultivation, not shown), we decided to further characterize the Ec-LldD enzyme as a putative DHB dehydrogenase. To this end, the wild-type Ec-LldD enzyme was produced from a pET28-derived vector expressed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> BL21 (DE3). As LldD is a membrane-associated enzyme and hence hardly to purify to homogeneity, we evaluated V<sup>max</sup> and K<sub>M</sub> of this enzyme directly on in crude protein extracts owing to the fact that the measured activity of this enzyme was highly reproducible from independent cultures expressing this gene in pET28<sup>+</sup>. While LldD activity on DHB and on (L)-lactate in cells bearing an empty plasmid was barely detectable (V<sup>max</sup>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01 U mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), overexpression of the gene encoding this enzyme resulted in a more than 50 fold increase of activity on these two substrates. However, the activity as well as the affinity of LldD on DHB were respectively 4 and 250 fold lower than on L-lactate (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Although these data were obtained on crude extracts and therefore does not provide true kinetic constant (k<sub>cat</sub>) and catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>), they clearly justify for a rational engineering of LldD with the expectation to increase the affinity of this enzyme towards DHB.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Membrane-associated 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase activities of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> BL21(DE3) cells expressing candidate his-tagged DHB dehydrogenases from the high-copy pET28 plasmid.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Plasmid</th><th colspan="2">(L)-lactate</th><th colspan="2">(D/L)-2,4-dihydroxybutyrate</th></tr><tr><th>V<sup>max</sup> [U mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>]<sup>a</sup></th><th>K<sub>M</sub> [10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> M]</th><th>V<sup>max</sup> [U mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>]<sup>a</sup></th><th>K<sub>M</sub> [10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> M]</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>pET28</td><td>0.01 (&#x000b1;0.000)<sup>c</sup></td><td>nd</td><td>0.01 (&#x000b1;0.0005)<sup>c</sup></td><td>&#x02014;</td></tr><tr><td>pET28-Ec-LlDd</td><td>2.1 (&#x000b1;0.2)</td><td>0.04 (&#x000b1;0.01)</td><td>0.6 (&#x000b1;0.1)</td><td>10.6 (&#x000b1;0.7)</td></tr><tr><td>pET28-Ec-LlDd<sub>V108C</sub></td><td>3.0 (&#x000b1;0.5)</td><td>0.2 (&#x000b1;0.0)</td><td>0.5 (&#x000b1;0.1)</td><td>6.6 (&#x000b1;0.8)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Data presented as the mean (&#x000b1;S.D.) of at least two replicates.</p><p><sup>a</sup>Activities were estimated in U mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> crude protein extract.</p><p><sup>b</sup>Specificity corresponds to the ratio of (v<sub>max</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>) between the natural substrate (L)-lactate and (D/L)-DHB.</p><p><sup>c</sup>Since no saturation was observed, activities were measured in the presence of either 50 mM (L)-lactate or 100 mM (D/L)-DHB.</p><p>nd: not determined.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="Par8">Amino acid residues responsible for substrate specificity in Ec-LldD were identified by visual inspection of the crystal structure of the homologous protein from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (Sc-Cyb2) bound to the reaction product pyruvate and the co-factor FMN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

The design of our co-culture strategy is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>. The upstream DHB-yielding pathway was expressed from the CF285 strain whilst the downstream part of the pathway that converted DHB into PDO was expressed in the strains Pen913 or Pen966. To evaluate the performance of the co-cultivation strategy, the DHB- and PDO-producing strains were cultivated for 24h in a 1:1 ratio at the inoculation stage on glucose-containing mineral medium. In a control experiment, strain CF285 that only expresses the DHB-yielding pathway produced 14.7 mM DHB but no PDO, whereas the co-cultivation of this strain with Pen913 or Pen 966 resulted in a PDO production that was 5 to 8 fold higher than with a strain expressing both pathways (compared data in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> with those in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). In both cases, DHB accumulated in the medium, which supported the idea that the PDO-producing pathway module is catalytically less efficient that the DHB-producing pathway module. Since the overexpression of <italic>glcA</italic> was found to enhance DHB uptake (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> in Supplementary Information), we repeated this co-cultivation strategy using strain CF283 (MG1655 <italic>glcA</italic><sup>proD</sup> bearing pPDO-2 or strain CF286 (MG1655 <italic>glcA</italic><sup>proD</sup> with pPDO-4). A PDO production of up to 4 mM was obtained with CF285:CF283 strain co-cultivation, whereas co-culture of CF285: CF286 produced only 1.5 mM PDO, confirming our earlier results (see above) that the OHB decarboxylase mutant Zm-Pdc W382Q was more efficient than the Ll-KdcA V461I for <italic>in vivo</italic> production PDO from glucose. In an attempt to increase PDO production, we doubled the amount of CF283 versus CF285 at the inoculation stage to compensate for the weaker activity of this pathway module. However, this change in the cultivation protocol did not improve PDO titers (data not shown). Altogether, these results demonstrate that the production of PDO directly from glucose is feasible and that, at least ate the present stage of the development, distributing pathway modules into two strains that are co-cultivated increases PDO titers.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>PDO production from glucose after 24 h with two <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain co-culture systems.

The proposed route uses a combination of natural and engineered enzymes acting on non-natural substrates. While the three first catalytic steps linking (L)-malate to DHB were constructed in a previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, the identification and engineering of enzymes catalyzing the three remaining enzymatic activities to convert DHB into PDO was targeted in this work. Based on a screening of candidate enzymes performing similar reactions and acting on sterically cognate substrates, enzymes with (L)-DHB dehydrogenase and OHB decarboxylase activities were identified. These enzymes exhibited, however, weak activities on the non-natural substrates. We therefore employed a rational enzyme engineering strategy which relied on the previously reported structural analysis of the 2-keto acid decarboxylase KdcA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, and the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> mitochondrial lactate oxidoreductase, the homologous to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli LldD</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Although the increase of activity of these enzymes on the non-natural substrates by a rational engineering strategy gave some limited success, it also provided interesting insights about the impact of the OHB decarboxylase in the DHB to PDO conversion, since only <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strains expressing Zm-Pdc<sub>W392Q</sub> variant together with LldD<sub>V108C</sub> was able to convert almost all L-DHB into PDO. In the other cases, the conversion rate was much lower indicating that OHB obtained from the oxidation of DHB by the LldD enzyme has been diverted into other pathway(s). The most likely explanation is the conversion of OHB into homoserine, by mean of a transaminase reaction involving glutamate as the &#x02018;NH<sub>2</sub>&#x02019; donor. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that we previously reported that aspartate aminotransferase encoded by aspC can catalyze the reversible reaction homoserine&#x02009;+&#x02009;&#x003b1;-ketoglutarate &#x0003c;&#x02212;&#x0003e; 4-hydroxy-2-keto butyrate + glutamate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

Therefore, there seems to be a key competition at the level of OHB between a transaminase and a decarboxylase reaction. Generation and screening of larger mutant libraries appears to be required for obtaining OHB decarboxylase as well as DHB dehydrogenase enzymes with adequate activities to solve this issue and favor the DHB-PDO production pathway. In this regard, our recently developed transcription-based aldehyde sensor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, which also responded to the PDO pathway intermediate 3-hydroxypropanal, could be an exquisite tool for <italic>in vivo</italic> screening of more efficient OHB decarboxylases as well as enzyme(s) mutant libraries generated of upstream reaction steps in the pathway.</p><p id="Par18">Even though the constituting enzymatic activities of the synthetic pathway were rather low, we could demonstrate a direct production of 0.1 mM PDO from 110 mM glucose by expression the whole pathway bearing six enzymatic reactions in a single <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain. Moreover, we could show that this weak production was in part due the metabolic burden on the production strain, which had to carry two plasmids since a co-cultivation strategy where the pathway was split into two functional modules resulted in a 10-fold increase in PDO titer. Also, another limitation that was in part alleviated was to engineer a better uptake of the DHB through overexpression of the GlcA permease, which further increase to PDO production by 4-fold. While these results are in line with previous studies, which also reported increase production rates upon co-culturing strains that express only parts of a long metabolic pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, this strategy can only be applied at very early stages of process development.
