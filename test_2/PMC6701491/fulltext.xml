Several computational methods have been developed to detect associations between cancer and lncRNAs, yet those approaches have limitations in both sensitivity and specificity. With the goal of improving the prediction accuracy for associations of lncRNA with cancer, we upgraded our previously developed cancer-related lncRNA classifier, CRlncRC, to generate CRlncRC2. CRlncRC2 is an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning framework, including Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)-based over-sampling, along with Laplacian Score-based feature selection. Ten-fold cross-validation showed that the AUC value of CRlncRC2 for identification of cancer-related lncRNAs is much higher than previously reported by CRlncRC and others. Compared with CRlncRC, the number of features used by CRlncRC2 dropped from 85 to 51. Finally, we identified 439 cancer-related lncRNA candidates using CRlncRC2. To evaluate the accuracy of the predictions, we first consulted the cancer-related long non-coding RNA database Lnc2Cancer v2.0 and relevant literature for supporting information, then conducted statistical analysis of somatic mutations, distance from cancer genes, and differential expression in tumor tissues, using various data sets. The results showed that our approach was highly reliable for identifying cancer-related lncRNA candidates. Notably, the highest ranked candidate, lncRNA AC074117.1, has not been reported previously; however, integrated multi-omics analyses demonstrate that it is the target of multiple cancer-related miRNAs and interacts with adjacent protein-coding genes, suggesting that it may act as a cancer-related competing endogenous RNA, which warrants further investigation. In conclusion, CRlncRC2 is an effective and accurate method for identification of cancer-related lncRNAs, and has potential to contribute to the functional annotation of lncRNAs and guide cancer therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>long noncoding RNA</kwd><kwd>machine learning</kwd><kwd>Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique</kwd><kwd>XGBoost</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="4"/><ref-count count="46"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="5674"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et al., 2018</xref>) and it is established that cancers are caused by genetic and epigenetic changes (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Kanwal and Gupta, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">You and Jones, 2012</xref>). Hence, high throughput technologies to characterize genes associated with cancer have applications with crucial implications for human health. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) account for the vast majority of non-coding RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides, and were previously considered &#x0201c;junk&#x0201d; RNA, due to their low coding potential; however, over recent decades, lncRNAs have been recognized as significant regulators of multiple major biological processes impacting development, differentiation, and metabolism (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bhan and Mandal, 2015</xref>). In cancer, lncRNAs act via multiple mechanisms, including regulation of chromatin topology in both cis and trans (chromatin remodeling, chromatin interactions), scaffolding of proteins and other RNAs, acting as protein and RNA decoys (competing endogenous RNA, ceRNA), regulating neighboring genes as natural antisense transcripts (NATs), and producing micropeptides (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aab et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Ransohoff et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The aberrant expression of lncRNAs has been linked to typical cancer hallmarks, such as continuous proliferation, bypassing apoptosis, genomic instability, drug resistance, invasion, and metastasis (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Renganathan and Felley-Bosco, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bhan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Balas and Johnson, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). For example, the lncRNA growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (<italic>GAS5</italic>), which is down-regulated in almost all tumor tissues, can suppress the tumorigenesis of cervical cancer by downregulating miR-196a and miR-205 (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2017</xref>), while <italic>LncRNA-PVT1</italic>, which is up-regulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), can improve tumor invasion and metastasis (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Further, Hox transcript antisense intergenic RNA (<italic>HOTAIR</italic>), which contributes to epigenetic regulation of genes, plays an important role in various cellular pathways by interacting with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Mercer and Mattick, 2013</xref>). In addition, due to dynamic changes in their expression levels as cancer develops, some lncRNAs are regarded as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bhan et al., 2017</xref>). The most prominent example of such a biomarker is prostate cancer antigen 3 (<italic>PCA3</italic>), a lncRNA expressed at high levels in prostate cancer (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">De Kok et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Yarmishyn and Kurochkin, 2015</xref>). The detection of <italic>PCA3</italic> in urine is a more specific marker for prostate cancer diagnosis than the commonly used factor, prostate specific antigen (PSA), and has been widely applied in the clinic (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Hessels et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Tinzl et al., 2004</xref>). Another example is lncRNA <italic>TUC339</italic>, which is highly enriched in extracellular vesicles secreted by hepatocellular carcinoma cells, where it regulates the growth and adhesion of tumor cells (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kogure et al., 2013</xref>). These features of lncRNA prompted us to search for efficient methods to predict functional lncRNAs in cancer, to facilitate deeper understanding of malignancies and the potential application of lncRNAs as targets for cancer therapies and diagnostics.</p><p>Systematic understanding of the contributions of lncRNAs to cancer is challenging, partly due to the unpredictability of lncRNA functional elements, as well as their relatively low conservation, low expression levels, and diverse functional mechanisms. The functions of a single lncRNA, or several lncRNAs, can be determined using experimental methods; however, this approach is time consuming and costly. The successful implementation of machine learning systems for the study of genomics, proteomics, systems biology, and evolution, has been a great inspiration to the field of life sciences more generally (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Larranaga et al., 2006</xref>). Using machine learning algorithms, we can determine the high dimensional characteristics of functional lncRNAs from an informatics perspective. To successfully apply machine learning to the identification of functional lncRNAs in cancer genomics, it is fundamental to first identify positive and negative sets. For this purpose, there are a number of repositories from which cancer-related lncRNAs can be conveniently obtained, including Lnc2Cancer v2.0, a manually curated database that provides comprehensive experimentally supported associations between lncRNAs and human cancer (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2019</xref>), and CRlncRNA, another manually curated database that uses stricter criteria to retain only data related to cancer hallmarks that have been experimentally confirmed (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). These databases can be exploited to develop machine learning models to predict and rank cancer-related lncRNAs. There has been relatively little research that has attempted to use machine learning methods to predict functional lncRNAs in cancer. For example, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. (2015)</xref> presented the first na&#x000ef;ve Bayes based machine learning method, and identified 707 cancer-related lncRNA candidates. In our previous work, we used a Random Forest based algorithm, CRlncRC, to classify cancer-related lncRNAs and other lncRNAs, through integration of 85 features (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>); however, compared with the computational prediction work reported for cancer-related protein-coding genes, the identification of cancer-related lncRNAs remains preliminary. The sensitivity and specificity of methods to predict cancer-related lncRNAs require further improvement.</p><p>In this study, we developed a new cancer-related lncRNA classifier, CRlncRC2. Compared with CRlncRC, CRlncRC2 uses the Laplacian score feature selection method to reduce training time and prevent over-fitting. In addition, unlike the na&#x000ef;ve under-sampling method adopted by CRlncRC, we address the data imbalance problem, which is caused by the relatively small size of available positive sets of cancer-related lncRNAs, using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) method, to balance imbalanced data, while aiming to retain all important information. Moreover, CRlncRC2 uses a more powerful machine learning model, extreme gradient boosting machine (XGBoost), to improve its predictive performance. Ten-fold cross-validation showed that the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC or area under ROC curve) score of CRlncRC2 is much higher than those of CRlncRC (0.86 vs. 0.82) and the method developed by Zhao et al. (0.90 vs. 0.79). Finally, 439 possible cancer-related lncRNAs were identified using CRlncRC2, of which 5 in the top 20 were confirmed using the Lnc2Cancer v2.0 database. Further, statistical analyses show that the identified lncRNAs are closer to cancer protein genes, carry more mutations, and are more likely to be differentially expressed in tumor tissues than negative lncRNAs. In addition, survival analysis revealed a significant difference in overall survival between the low and high expression groups of the top 10 predictions. In particular, one lncRNA, AC074117.1 (ENSG00000234072), which was the top ranked of our predictions and has not been reported in the literature, is suggested as being highly likely to be associated with cancer in the lncRNA-related ceRNA network. In conclusion, CRlncRC2 exhibited good performance in both cross-validation and prediction evaluation. We believe our framework will be a useful tool for study of lncRNA&#x02013;cancer associations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Our experiment followed the pipeline illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">

The criteria for cancer-related lncRNA collection include either differentially expressed in cancer (as verified by Real-Time qRT-PCR), co-occurred with a significant relevant clinicopathological parameter (e.g., tumor differentiation, clinical stage, and survival time), or proven by functional experiments (e.g., colony formation assay, matrigel invasiveness assay, xenograft mouse model, and metastasis nude mouse model). As the category of cancer unrelated lncRNA is difficult to define, and for consistency with other classifiers, we located a large number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with phenotypes derived from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Welter et al., 2014</xref>) in the sequences of lncRNAs, and only those lncRNAs which had no phenotype-related SNPs detected within its 10 kb up/down stream were selected as cancer non-related lncRNAs.

In cancer genomic research, the currently known cancer-related lncRNA (positive) set are only available because they were identified by humans. It is possible that some samples in the negative set may be considered to belong to the positive set in the future. Hence, we employed Laplacian scoring (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2005</xref>), which is designed to select features without labels, as a criterion to evaluate the correlations of each feature. The basic idea of Laplacian score is to evaluate the features according to their locality preserving power, which is from the Laplacian Eigenmaps (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chung, 1997</xref>) and Locality Preserving Projection (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">He and Niyogi, 2003</xref>).</p><p>In detail, we applied the scikit-feature (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>) to calculate Laplacian scores; the parameters for the affinity matrix used for the calculation are as follows: metric = euclidean, neighbor mode = knn, and k = 5. Calculated scores range from 0 to 1, with smaller values indicating more important features. The distribution of calculated Laplacian scores is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">
<bold>Figure 2</bold>
</xref> and clearly shows that there are large margins in each category of features. In this case, we can determine the di&#x0fb00;erence between the sorted Laplacian scores (asc) and use the first two differential values to set a threshold. Specifically, we set the margins in &#x0201c;Epigenetic&#x0201d; to the second and third largest di&#x0fb00;erential values, because these appeared to be the inflection points. Hence, the features were split into three parts, and the features located in the lower part (i.e., those with scores indicating that the features are more important) retained immediately. Nevertheless it is not advisable to simply remove those features located in the other parts, as these also contain some information. Therefore, we merged the features according to the mean in each part and retained the merged features to preserve the information. For example, the middle scoring part of &#x0201c;Expression&#x0201d; contains two features, and we removed these two features, while retaining their mean value. The mean-merged feature obtained from the high scoring parts were also retained. Finally, generated training and validation sets by concatenating the processed category features. Changes in the feature number in each category are summarized in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">

The algorithm stratified shuffles the total samples into 10 folds, and begins an iteration: each time 9 folds are initially over-sampled, and then assigned for training.

Subsequently, the over-sampled training set was used to fit the model, while the validation set was utilized to evaluate the model&#x02019;s performance. Note that the validation set in each iteration is not re-sampled and does not include any data used for training. Further, the models trained on each iteration are independent of one another.

First, we hypothesized that the potential cancer-related lncRNAs were likely to have more somatic mutations in cancer genomes, since many previous studies have demonstrated that mutations in functional genes are a primary cause of carcinogenesis. To validate this assumption, we compared the number of somatic mutations (documented in COSMIC) between different lncRNA sets and a cancer-related protein-coding gene set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">

The results showed that the cancer-related protein-coding gene set, as the positive control, contained far more somatic mutations than the cancer-unrelated lncRNA set (negative control, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p-value = 6.10e-33). The somatic mutation numbers in both the positive and predicted cancer-related lncRNA sets were between those of cancer-unrelated lncRNAs and cancer-related protein-coding genes, with a significantly higher quantity than those in cancer-unrelated lncRNAs (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p-value 2.35e-07 and 8.27e-06, respectively).</p><p>As a number of lncRNAs exert their function in cis, by influencing neighboring genes, we assumed that these potential cancer-related lncRNAs were likely closer to cancer-related protein-coding genes than cancer-unrelated lncRNAs. Therefore, we calculated the distances of different lncRNA sets to their closest cancer-related proteins, and compared them with the random background (i.e., the distance between cancer-related protein-coding genes and random positions in genome) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">

We found that the distances between cancer-unrelated lncRNAs and cancer-related protein-coding genes were significantly larger than those between cancer-related lncRNAs and cancer-related protein-coding genes (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p-value = 4.1e-4). Similarly, the distance of predicted cancer-related lncRNAs from cancer-related protein-coding genes was far shorter than that of cancer-unrelated lncRNAs (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p-value = 4.9e-06). Moreover, no significant difference in distance was detected between background and the cancer-unrelated lncRNA set, as expected.</p><p>Next, we examined whether the expression levels of cancer-related lncRNAs differed from those of cancer-unrelated lncRNAs in cancer samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">

Using lncRNA expression data from the TANRIC database, we calculated the percentage of lncRNAs that were differentially expressed (absolute log<sub>2</sub>-fold change &#x0003e; 1) between cancer and paracancerous tissue sample pairs, to determine whether this differed among the lncRNA sets. We found that lncRNAs in the positive set had the highest percentage of differentially expressed genes (approximately 40%), while the value for the negative set was only approximately 20%. Among predicted cancer-related lncRNAs, &#x0003e; 35% of them showed differential expression.

First, for biological data, frequently, only small positive sets are available, due to the difficulty of collecting information, such as patient data and experimental verification of functional genes, which greatly impedes the practical application of machine learning. Further, machine learning models require optimization for high performance, according to the specific data and situation. To address these problems, in this study, we selected the most stringent criteria to select the positive and negative sets, and used the latest histological information for feature extraction. We chose over-sampling in our new algorithm because it enables use of more information relative to under-sampling, and the results confirmed that it can improve accuracy and specificity. Moreover, we merged features with high Laplacian scores and got eight synthesis features, which had a highest feature importance rank. Our findings suggest that high Laplacian score features still contain useful information and is not good practice to simply discard them.</p><p>LncRNAs have been applied in clinical practice as new biomarkers and prognostic indicators.

Moreover, with increasing research into lncRNAs, greater quantities of relevant high-throughput data are becoming easier to obtain. The development of functional research into lncRNAs has revealed additional functional elements and mechanisms (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Brockdorff, 2018</xref>). Further, numerous new tools for evaluating the similarity of non-linear sequences, using k-mer content (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Kirk et al., 2018</xref>) and a new evolutionary classification perspective (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), have been developed, which can be used to extract new features, such as lncRNA conservation. These can facilitate better application of bioinformatics methods to predict cancer-related lncRNAs and assist in cancer diagnosis and treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we upgraded CRlncRC to CRlncRC2, using a powerful machine learning algorithm (XGBoost), Laplacian score feature selection, and an advanced over-sampling method (SMOTE). The results show that both XGBoost and SMOTE can help to improve model accuracy and specificity. After feature engineering, most of the expressed and methylated features are retained, indicating their importance for predicting lncRNAs with potential functions in cancer. Using much fewer features, CRlncRC2 has a mean AUC value 0.04 higher than that of CRlncRC. In addition, our predicted top-ranking cancer-related lncRNA candidates are supported by Inc2Cancer v2.0, literature reports, and statistical data. In summary, CRlncRC2 is an effective and useful method for lncRNA-cancer association identification.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data Availability</title><p>The datasets analyzed for this study can be found at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://github.com/xuanblo/CRlncRC2">https://github.com/xuanblo/CRlncRC2</uri>.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>CL and LC conceived, designed, and supervised this study.
