    "Cancer mortality rates are undergoing a global downward trend; however, metastasis and relapse after surgery and adjuvant treatments still correlate with poor prognosis and represent the most significant challenges in the treatment of this disease. Advances in genomics, metabolomics, and proteomics are improving our understanding regarding cancer metabolic diversity, resulting in detailed classifications of tumors and raising the effectiveness of precision medicine. Likewise, the growing knowledge of interactions between nutrients and the expression of certain genes could lead to cancer therapies based on precision nutrition strategies. This review aims to identify the recent advances in the knowledge of the mechanistic role of bioactive phytochemicals in foodstuffs in tumor progression, metastasis, and chemo-resistance in order to assess their potential use in precision nutrition therapies targeting relapse in lung, breast, colon, and prostate cancer, and leukemia. A considerable number of bioactive phytochemicals in foodstuffs were identified in the literature with proven effects modulating tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. In addition, the use of foodstuffs in cancer, and specifically in relapse therapies, is being reinforced by the development of different formulations that significantly increase the therapeutic efficiency of these products. This can open the possibility for testing combinations of bioactive phytochemicals with cancer relapse treatments as a potential prevention strategy."
