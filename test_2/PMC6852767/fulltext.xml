Endogenous OXT plays important roles in the labor process, lactation and maternal behavior after birth. During labor, uterus contractions are triggered through the binding of endogenous OXT to its receptor in myometrium cells. If required, uterine activity can be stimulated with synthetic OXT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] to induce or augment labor, to support placental delivery or to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. Towards the end of pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and during treatment with synthetic OXT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], expression of oxytocin receptor (OXTR) in myometrium cells increases. Changes in OXTR expression, but also the existence of genetically variant forms of this receptor are likely to affect sensitivity towards OXT (and other OXTR binding medications), and to contribute to the variety of patient responses that are observed in clinical practice.</p><p id="Par6">Previous experimental work has shown that a few rare single-nucleotide variants of <italic>OXTR</italic> might affect the binding of OXT to this seven-transmembrane-helix receptor and possibly affect OXT-mediated signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Moreover, an association between a few common substitution OXTR variants and the prevalence of preterm birth has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Other studies revealed that a combination of three common minor allelic variants from the <italic>OXTR</italic> can increase preterm birth risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and that the minor allele of the common rs53576 variant is associated with a long transition to active labor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Finally, there are some indications that <italic>OXTR</italic>single-nucleotide variants may affect the response to OXT-treatment with regard to labor induction and augmentation, mode of delivery and prevalence of preterm birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">We hypothesized that at least some of the influences of <italic>OXTR</italic> variants on clinically-relevant outcomes occur through changes in OXT-mediated cell signaling.

In these studies, contractility of myometrium strips was often measured in the absence and/or in the presence of OXT, and, when enough material was available, tissue samples were shock frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;&#x02009;80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for further determination of relevant genetics and mRNA level.

During surgery, a myometrium sample of about 5&#x02009;g was removed from the patient&#x02019;s uterus by the physician in charge and placed immediately in ice-cold Ringer&#x02019;s solution. Part of the sample was further processed for the contractility experiments, the remaining material was cut in pieces of approximately 60&#x02009;mg, shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at &#x02212;&#x02009;80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C until DNA and RNA extraction<italic>.</italic> For the present study, samples were included if contractility data in both the absence and presence of OXT to stimulate contractions of maximal strength (either 1&#x02009;U/mL or 40&#x02009;U/mL) was available for at least one strip and enough DNA and RNA could be extracted.

To verify whether these different concentrations had an impact on the results, OXT concentration was added as a co-variate to the linear regression model used to compare reference and variant groups (multivariate model). Comparison of the beta coefficients with those obtained in the univariate linear regression model showed that, both in the case of rs237888 and of rs4686302, the differences between reference and variant groups remained significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001 and <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.028, respectively).</p><p id="Par19">We have considered the possibility that rs237888 and rs4686302 could co-exist in some samples. Only one sample had both allele variants rs237888 and rs4686302; interestingly, this was the sample with the highest OXT stimulation. To find out whether rs237888 and rs4686302 are in LD, a linkage disequilibrium analysis within the European population was performed. This analysis revealed that no disequilibrium between rs237888 and rs4686302 exists ((EUR population R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003, D&#x02019;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.577; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). In some of the sequence variants studied, high LDs were detected, e.g. rs4686301 and rs11706648 (EUR population R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.884, D&#x02019;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.967), and low LD between rs237895 and rs53576 (EUR population R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.718, D&#x02019;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.962).

In other words, the increase in contraction force upon OXT stimulation in the groups of samples with these <italic>OXTR</italic> allele variants was higher relative to the reference groups. Other sequence variants previously shown to be associated with birth-related outcomes &#x02013; rs1042778, rs11706648, rs4686301, rs53576, rs237895, and rs237902 &#x02013; did not seem to affect OXT stimulation of contractility under our experimental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par22">In this functional in vitro study, the effects on myometrium response to OXT were observed in an assay that closely reflects the biological environment. Moreover, the myograph-setup allows working under defined conditions. These aspects can be seen as major strengths of our study, which complements well previous work based on clinical and epidemiological data. There were also some limitations, because the data on contractility resulted from pooling two previous original studies designed to address other research questions. These original studies comprised measurements of contraction strength in the absence and in the presence of only one oxytocin concentration (dose-dependency experiments may have been more appropriate for the present research question) in a moderate number of samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Interpretation</title><p id="Par23">The subgroup with at least one variant allele at rs237888 (T) showed a higher in vitro OXT stimulation of contractility than the corresponding reference subgroup. A previous study showed an association between this sequence variant and a lower risk for cesarean section among women induced near term. This lower cesarean section rate was associated with a lower OXT dose, lower maximal OXT infusion rate and lower duration of labor induction with OXT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Increased response of the myometrium to OXT stimulation might explain the observed lower cesarean rate. However, it is still unclear, how this association can be explained in detail in terms of molecular/cellular biology. The variant allele at rs237888 is located in an intron, i.e. has no effect on the protein-coding sequence. Moreover, no effect on expression was observed (levels of mRNA were comparable between variant allele and reference subgroups). A search of the GTEx database for the impact of this variant on the expression of <italic>OXTR</italic> was also completed, but yielded no results (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gtexportal.org/home">www.gtexportal.org/home</ext-link>, 28.09.2018, expression quantitative trait loci, eQTL). However, a splice variant located at rs237888 as well as at the transcription factor binding sites (see Regulatory Built /Ensembl; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1) might affect transcription and translation; this still needs to be assessed.</p><p id="Par24">The variant allele at rs4686302 (T) was previously shown to be associated with prematurity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Our data showing an increased stimulatory effect of OXT in the samples with this variant allele goes along with this clinical finding as an increased stimulatory effect of OXT during preterm labor might lead to preterm delivery. Another indication that OXT sensitivity might be influenced by this sequence variant derives from an American study in which several allele variants were characterized in women requiring extreme OXT doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. rs4686302 is a common substitution variant in exon 3 with nonsynonymous influence on the OXTR protein. The protein corresponding to this variant has a p.A218T amino acid substitution located in the transmembrane domain 5 that seems to be involved in the important step of G-protein activation together with the second intracellular loop and the third intracellular loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, a small change in the tertiary structure at this place could have consequences for G-protein-coupled signal transduction. An in silico prediction, however, revealed no functional significance of this amino acid substitution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Since this variant was furthermore not associated with differences in the amounts of <italic>OXTR</italic>-mRNA in the current study, the meaning of the variant rs4686302 for OXT-induced cell signaling remains unknown. Also, in the case of this variant, no eQTL data were available (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gtexportal.org/home">www.gtexportal.org/home</ext-link>, 28.09.2018); nevertheless, a CpG Island is located at the rs4686302 sequence, which might still influence expression regulation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1).</p><p id="Par25">Labor is a complex process and numerous factors play important roles. The existence of genetically variant forms of OXTR are likely to influence patient responses to medications that bind to this receptor. Concerning treatment with synthetic OXT, clinical practice shows that not all patients benefit equally. Patients&#x02019; response to this medication is highly variable; some patients need higher, others lower doses to obtain a similar effect. It is conceivable that a screening method could enable personalized improvements in labor management. Also, the prevention of preterm delivery, which has a major impact on neonatal morbidity and mortality, might in the future profit from a personalized risk assessment of every patient. It is questionable if oxytocin-receptorantagonists for the treatment of preterm labor work equally well in every patient; clinical experience and first in vitro data such as ours suggest that subgroups of patients with specific single-nucleotide sequence variants of the <italic>OXTR</italic> benefit differently from diverse tocolytic agents. Our work, performed with myometrium samples from 60 patients, suggests that patients with rs237888 and/or rs4686302 may be more sensitive to OXT stimulation. This might explain why patients with these variants&#x000a0;less often need a cesarean in the course of labor induction with OXT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and were thought to be prone to preterm labor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], respectively]. Additional research should estimate possible clinical benefits of introducing an rs237888 and rs4686302 screening at pregnancy begin. While doing so and given that these two sequence variants are not in LD, it would make sense to consider them separately.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par26">Taken together, our data confirm that genetic variants of the <italic>OXTR</italic> gene might have an impact on the birth process and suggest that in some cases this occurs via differences in myometrial contractility strength as induced by OXT. Our work depicts the necessity of starting a discussion on whether introducing an <italic>OXTR</italic> variant screening at pregnancy begin would contribute to reduce the prevalence of preterm deliveries and/or of cesareans in the course of labor induction with OXT. A screening feasibility study could contribute to address this question. Moreover, additional basic research is needed to clarify how exactly the various <italic>OXTR</italic>-variants may influence contractility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec15"><p>
