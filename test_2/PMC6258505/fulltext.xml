Homozygous <italic>pr72</italic> KO fish struggled to survive to adulthood and exhibited cardiac developmental defects, including enlarged ventricular chambers, reduced cardiomyocytes and decreased cardiac function. And the defective sarcomere ultrastructure that affected mitochondria, I bands, Z lines, and intercalated disks was also observed. Furthermore, the abnormal heart looping was detected in mutants which could be rescued by injection with wild type <italic>pr72</italic> mRNA. Additionally, it was found that Wnt effectors were elevated in mutants.

Recently in addition to kinases, people paid more and more attention to levels and activities of protein phosphatases in the process of heart diseases [<xref rid="pone.0206883.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206883.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), one of the major serine/threonine phosphatases, is composed of three subunits: scaffold A subunits, catalytic C subunits and variable regulatory B subunits [<xref rid="pone.0206883.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206883.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. There are at least four families of PP2A regulatory B subunits, and each family has more than one familiar members: identified as B (PPP2R2A/B/C/D), B' (PPP2R5A/B/C/D/E), B'' (PPP2R3A/B/C) and B&#x02034; (PPP2R4) [<xref rid="pone.0206883.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The activity, specificity and subcellular localization of the PP2A heterotrimeric holoenzyme complex, are highly regulated through the interaction of regulatory B subunit family members with the substrates [<xref rid="pone.0206883.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. PP2A contributes to a central role in cardiac diseases [<xref rid="pone.0206883.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0206883.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Transgenic mouse lines expressing either mutated structural A subunits or catalytic C subunits exhibit a cardiac phenotype resembling dilated cardiomyopathy [<xref rid="pone.0206883.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206883.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Deletion of the regulatory B56&#x003b3; subunit, results in heart development defects, including reduced cardiomyocytes (CMs) and a ventricular septal defect [<xref rid="pone.0206883.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, depletion of B56&#x003b1; results in improved cardiac function [<xref rid="pone.0206883.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. So far, the role and regulation of this critical enzyme family especially subunit B, was still largely elusive in cardiac diseases.</p><p>PPP2R3A (PP2A, regulatory subunit B'', alpha, NM_181897.2), as one member of regulatory subunit B'' family, was found to be located on both Z- and M-lines in cardiomyocytes and has the differential transcriptional regulation in heart failure [<xref rid="pone.0206883.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. PR72 and PR130 are two different transcriptions of <italic>PPP2R3A</italic>. PR72 has an N terminus that differs from that of PR130 but shares the same C terminus. PR72 is a negative regulator of Wnt signaling pathway, while Wnt pathway plays an important role in heart development [<xref rid="pone.0206883.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In our previous study, we found that PR130 was required for normal cardiac development [<xref rid="pone.0206883.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus, we made a hypothesis that PR72 might also play a major role in heart development.</p><p>To investigate the function of PR72 in heart, we created two <italic>pr72</italic> knockout (KO) zebrafish lines, and found that <italic>pr72</italic> KO zebrafish showed cardiac defects, which indicating that PR72 might involve in cardiac development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Zebrafish lines</title><p>The AB zebrafish and cmlc2: EGFP transgenic zebrafish were maintained as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0206883.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

Equal amounts of left and right TALEN mRNA (100ng/uL) were injected together into 1-cell-stage zebrafish embryos using a Harvard micro-injector (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). To analyze the induced somatic small indels, groups of embryos were collected at 48 hours post-fertilization (hpf). Deletion events within the target site were screened by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and confirmed by clone sequencing and western blot. The positive founders were outcrossed with Wt zebrafish, and F1 embryos at 24 hpf were again screened for germ line transmission by PCR-RFLP. Then, the F1 embryos of the positive founders were raised to adulthood, and the tail fins of the adult F1 zebrafish were analyzed individually.

Pr72 was not maternally deposited in zebrafish differently from in Xenopus, probably due to species difference [<xref rid="pone.0206883.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, it expressed from 24-hpf embryos to adult fish, and presented the dominant expression in hearts, which indicated Pr72&#x02019;s function in zebrafish heart development. Furthermore, we found that the mutant zebrafish exhibited enlarged ventricular chambers and significantly reduced ventricular end-diastolic diameter and atrial fractional shortening. Unfortunately, the cardiac function could be detected only in transparent zebrafish embryos but not in non-transparent adults. But we still observed enlarged ventricular chambers and reduced CMs started from atrium, just like the initial thinning of heart wall was obvious in the embryo-atrium. And the looping defects in mutants derived by <italic>pr72</italic> KO could be rescued by the injection of Wt <italic>pr72</italic> mRNA, which showed that the phenotype was distinctively due to the <italic>pr72</italic> deletion.</p><p>This role may possibly be ascribed to a function of <italic>pr72</italic> against the canonical Wnt/ &#x003b2;-catenin (Wnt) signaling pathway.

Almost at the same time, two research groups reported that knockdown of another antagonist of Wnt/signaling pathway, Tmem88, activated the canonical Wnt pathway and led to the reduction of myocardium, which had the similar results as ours [<xref rid="pone.0206883.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206883.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We also observed the increase of <italic>nkd2a</italic>, which could be the feedback up-regulation caused by the <italic>pr72</italic> deletion. In addition, we observed <italic>pr72</italic> expression in the branchial arches, while the canonical Wnt pathway has been found to regulate craniofacial patterning and morphogenesis within the brachial arches, so Pr72 might be required for development of branchial arches as a negative regulator of Wnt pathway[<xref rid="pone.0206883.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Using transmission electron microscopy, we observed that the I bands disappeared, the thick Z lines became uneven and intercalated disks (IDs) grew vague with a decreased number of small desmosomes in the sarcomeres of <italic>pr72</italic> KO fish. These structural changes in sarcomeres might possibly be a direct consequence of the defective dephosphorylation process of the thin filament proteins. PP2A has been shown to play a critical role in the dephosphorylation of thin filament proteins, including Actin, Tropomyosin, and the Troponin complex (Troponin C, I and T), which regulates myofilament contractility [<xref rid="pone.0206883.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206883.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For example, Troponin I dephosphorylation by PP2A increases the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of the myofilament. The disappeared I band and increased heart rate in the <italic>pr72</italic> KO fish, might due to the abnormal dephosphorylation of the thin filament proteins by affecting Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of myofilament. Compared with the widely expressed PP2A, the surprising diversity in the expression and distribution of the regulatory B subunit may be related to the substrate specificity and subcellular localization of PP2A [<xref rid="pone.0206883.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Being consistent with an important function of PP2A in regulating myofilaments, the regulator subunit, PPP2R3A has been found to locate in the Z-lines of the CM [<xref rid="pone.0206883.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesized the sick and uneven Z band could be the results of <italic>pr72</italic> deletion.</p><p>In our previous study, deletion of <italic>pr130</italic> in zebrafish resulted in cardiac developmental defects, including cardiac looping defects, reduced cardiomyocytes, disturbance of cardiac ultra-structure and decreased cardiac function [<xref rid="pone.0206883.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].
