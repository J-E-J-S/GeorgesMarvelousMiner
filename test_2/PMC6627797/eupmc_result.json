    "Protein-based bioinspired nanomaterials (PBNs) combines the advantage of the size, shape, and surface chemistry of nanomaterials, the morphology and functions of natural materials, and the physical and chemical properties of various proteins. Recently, there are many exciting developments on biomimetic nanomaterials using proteins for different applications including, tissue engineering, drug delivery, diagnosis and therapy, smart materials and structures, and water collection and separation. Protein-based biomaterials with high biocompatibility and biodegradability could be modified to obtain the healing effects of natural organisms after injury by mimicking the extracellular matrix. For cancer and other diseases that are difficult to cure now, new therapeutic methods involving different kinds of biomaterials are studied. The nanomaterials with surface modification, which can achieve high drug loading, can be used as drug carriers to enhance target and trigger deliveries. For environment protection and the sustainability of the world, protein-based nanomaterials are also applied for water treatment. A wide range of contaminants from natural water source, such as organic dyes, oil substances, and multiple heavy ions, could be absorbed by protein-based nanomaterials. This review summarizes the formation and application of functional PBNs, and the details of their nanostructures, the proteins involved, and the synthetic approaches are addressed."
