One process enabling adaptation is based on minor changes in genome sequence, as small as a few base pairs, within segments of genome called simple sequence repeats (SSRs) that consist of multiple copies of a short sequence (from one to several nucleotides), repeated in series. SSRs are found in eukaryotes as well as prokaryotes, and length variation in them occurs at frequencies up to a million-fold higher than bacterial point mutations through the process of slipped strand mispairing (SSM) by DNA polymerase during replication. The characterization of SSR length by standard sequencing methods is complicated by the appearance of length variation introduced during the sequencing process that obscures the lower abundance repeat number variants in a population. Here we report a computational approach to correct for sequencing process-induced artifacts, validated for tetranucleotide repeats by use of synthetic constructs of fixed, known length. We apply this method to a laboratory culture of <italic>Histophilus somni</italic>, prepared from a single colony, and demonstrate that the culture consists of populations of distinct sequence phase and length variants at individual tetranucleotide SSR loci.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Next-generation sequencing</kwd><kwd>Genome informatics</kwd><kwd>Bacterial genomics</kwd><kwd>Bacterial pathogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Cattlemen&#x00026;apos;s Beef Association</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Cattlemen&#x00026;apos;s Beef Association</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Cattlemen&#x00026;apos;s Beef Association</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Cattlemen&#x00026;apos;s Beef Association</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Bacteria utilize several mechanisms to reversibly and rapidly switch gene expression states in response to environmental cues, including gene conversion, homologous recombination, site-specific recombination, and SSR length variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. SSM-mediated SSR length variation can result in rapid phenotypic changes in response to environmental changes enabling adaptation. When SSR length variation affects phenotype, it is referred to as phase variation, and has been observed in multiple bacterial species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. For example, gram-negative mucosal pathogens including <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>, <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, and <italic>Haemophilus influenza</italic> exploit SSM-mediated phase variation to adapt to host reproductive, gastric, and respiratory niches, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Similarly, in the normally commensal gram-positive gastrointestinal bacteria <italic>Streptococcus gallolyticus</italic>, SSM-mediated phase variation can cause a shift in pili expression resulting in infective endocarditis in elderly patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The stochastic nature of SSRs make them challenging to characterize. Specifically, approaches based on locus-targeting using PCR can be complicated by artifacts during amplification, whereby the polymerase introduces changes not actually present in the genome. For example, genotyping of SSR microsatellites for genetic studies in mammalian genomes demonstrates the generation of variant amplification products (&#x0201c;stutter bands&#x0201d;), whether analyzed by gel-based sizing or by sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This artifact may occur even when libraries are prepared without amplification because the sequencing platform itself uses PCR for generating clusters for sequencing. In addition, both gel-based length determination and SBS-based methods have limitations with respect to the total length of SSRs that can be analyzed. In the former, the resolution of gel separation is limiting, and in the latter the limitation is the available read lengths. SBS methods were previously used in a comparative genomics approach to predict SSM-mediated SSR length variable loci involving cell surface structures or DNA metabolism (and therefore linked to virulence) in five isolates of <italic>Neisseria meningitides</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Although the library preparation avoided amplification, the SBS method performed cluster generation on the sequencing instrument by PCR methods. There was only an average of 66 read pairs reported that fully spanned the SSRs. The impact of sequence technology-induced apparent variation was assessed by examining supposedly invariant (non-phase variant) SSR within the same isolate. However, 11% of putative &#x0201c;non-variant&#x0201d; SSRs were still observed to display variable numbers of RU that could either be artifacts of the sequencing or true biological variation. A similar approach had been previously used to control for indels in C/G homopolymer tracts associated with phase variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Long-read SMRT sequencing in circular consensus sequence (CCS) mode holds promise to improve interpretation of sequence data with respect to SSR variability, as it avoids amplification-based artifacts and corrects for sequencing error by repeatedly sequencing across both strands of the SSR to correct for errors that may occasionally occur in a single pass. Further, the CCS lengths can span essentially all SSRs present in bacteria. CCS sequencing has been previously applied to improve the characterizations of longer SSRs in mammalian genomes and identify association with disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, in general, these genetic studies were designed to determine the diploid genotype of the individual, and when minor numbers of sequences were observed with lengths other than the two main genotypes, they were simply ignored. In the context of bacterial populations, it is imperative to separate experimental artifact from true genomic variation in SSR length to enable precise quantitative assessments of the impact of lowly abundant SSR length variants on the biological mechanisms affected by SSM-mediated phase variation. No previous study, to our knowledge, has performed controlled experiments designed to identify and quantify the impact of sequencing technology-based artifact on the interpretation of SSM-mediated SSR length variability in bacterial populations.</p><p id="Par5">To differentiate between biological signal and sequencing-induced artifact, we created synthetic DNA duplexes of defined length mimicking the observed genomic sequences to eliminate intra-sample variability that could exist in preparations of bacterial genomic DNA. This approach supported the direct estimation of sequence artifact based on the postulate that SSM-mediated total SSR length variation must change by an integer number of SSR RUs. Where this postulate holds true, the fractional base compositions (FBC, the proportion of the number of A, C, G, or T relative to the total number of bases in the SSR) for a base in SSM-mediated SSR length variants are necessarily nearly identical and essentially independent of the total length of the SSR, given the SSR &#x0003e; RU length. We developed a method to identify the segment of each CCS that completely spans an SSR, defined as the region of interest (ROI), followed by extraction of the ROI from each CCS, then the application of minimum quality and maximum FBC filters. The FBC filter utilizes a z-score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, where the FBCs for each base were computed for each CCS and the dispersion of these FBC values were computed in the form of a z-score, a normalized or &#x0201c;standard&#x0201d; dimensionless form of the standard deviation. The z-score threshold is the maximum allowable absolute value of the z-scores that a given CCS must possess to pass the filter.</p><p id="Par6">The SSR that we used to develop our analytical method was originally observed in a strain of <italic>Histophilus somni</italic>, a gram-negative mucosal inhabitant and occasional pathogen of cattle (GenBank accession <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CP018802">CP018802</ext-link> see Methods). This genome was chosen because it possessed the longest perfect tetranucleotide repeat (250&#x02009;bp) that we have observed in our collection of closed bacterial genomes associated with respiratory disease. The 79&#x02009;bp perfect tetranucleotide SSR (20 RU-1&#x02009;bp) with RU sequence AAGC was the largest tetranucleotide SSR in this genome that we could target for chemical synthesis because there is a practical limit of 100&#x02009;bp for chemically synthesized oligonucleotides that could be annealed into duplexes by commercial providers. Additionally, we wanted to maintain the X RU-1&#x02009;bp phase and include sufficient flanking sequence for robust annealing which we deemed to be one turn of the DNA helix (10.5 bases), setting a minimum flank length of 11&#x02009;bp. This flanking sequence was also necessary to test our methods to identify and extract CCS ROIs from extant genomic sequence, followed by removal of flanking sequence to generate the CCS ROI presented here. All the aforementioned considerations constrained the control total SSR length to be practically limited to duplexes containing 18 RU-1 bp (71&#x02009;bp SSR, 96&#x02009;bp oligonucleotide), 17 RU-1 bp (67&#x02009;bp SSR, 92&#x02009;bp oligonucleotide), or 16 RU-1 bp (63&#x02009;bp SSR, 88&#x02009;bp oligonucleotide) plus genome flanking sequence of 14&#x02009;bp on the 5&#x02032;-end of the SSR and 11&#x02009;bp on the 3&#x02032;-end. The only primary sequence difference between the synthetic duplexes and the genomic SSRs was the number of RUs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Minimization of artifacts in CCS spanning an SSR within a synthetic duplex</title><p id="Par7">In Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, we show histograms of the number of CCS observed at multiple mapped SSR lengths, both before and after filtering the data (see Methods).

Remaining CCS in the bins 1&#x02009;bp less or more than the control SSR length (we define as 1&#x02009;bp sidebands) consisted entirely of adenine deletions or insertion (arrow call-outs in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The sidebands for the bins observed for modes 1 RU larger or smaller than the control SSR length mode are also the result of adenine insertion/deletions, indicating this is the primary error mode for CCS sequencing in this AAGC repeat context.

Because the input DNA fragments were a homogeneous, synthetic population with a 63&#x02009;bp SSR, the other CCS in +/&#x02212;1, 2 and &#x02212;3 RU bins were necessarily due to SSM during sequencing, and occurred with a frequency relative to the control SSR length mode of 1.13% at &#x02212;1 RU (59&#x02009;bp), 0.736% at +1 RU (67&#x02009;bp), 0.077% at &#x02212;2 RU (55&#x02009;bp), 0.042% at +2 RU (71&#x02009;bp). The FBC z-score threshold retained 95% of the control SSR length CCS after both filters were applied. Thus, the FBC z-score filter is a mechanism that reduces the inherent artifacts of the sequencing process so that variation in the apparent number of synthetic duplex DNA molecules with SSR RU number can be estimated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Minimization of artifacts in CCS spanning individual SSRs from a mixture of three synthetic duplexes</title><p id="Par9">The suitability of this FBC-based filter for mixtures of SSR length was examined to demonstrate the minimization of sequencing artifacts between multiple SSR lengths from a single DNA sample. Three duplex libraries containing 15, 16, or 17 RU were pooled in a 2:4:1 mole ratio, respectively, before library preparation and CCS sequencing. The diffusion loading of the ZMWs is non-linear with respect to library size and concentration and we note that our&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;100&#x02009;bp duplexes inserts are a non-canonical use of the technology that is currently being used to sequence inserts &#x0003e;5&#x02009;kb. This loading behavior does not affect the SSR results acquired from the <italic>H. somni</italic> CCS genomic inserts in this study (average length&#x02009;=&#x02009;2467&#x02009;bp, standard deviation&#x02009;=&#x02009;1061.4&#x02009;bp, 841 X coverage) where each CCS was required to span the entire extent of the SSRs and SSM variants if present. The data were analyzed in the same fashion as for the single duplex (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d&#x02013;f</xref>) and demonstrated the same characteristics with respect to sidebands and adenine insertion/deletion (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>), and artifact SSM (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>), occurring with similar frequencies. The impact of FBC z-score on histogram distribution was explored (see the CodeOcean compute capsule)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and demonstrates that once the 1&#x02009;bp sideband modes are removed with a FBC z-score of around 1.5, the histograms do not change until the FBC z-score is set to below 1. The breadth of 0.5 (1.5 to 1) in the FBC z-scores yielding identical CCS length distributions demonstrates that the filter should provide a reasonably straightforward path to remove artifact and that this method is not excessively dependent on the precise choice of FBC z-score. Practically speaking, the FBC z-score is adjusted from large to small until all of the side bands are removed. These data suggest that the FBC z-score filter provides a robust estimate of the actual length heterogeneity in a population of genomic SSRs using CCS sequencing, by controlling for the occurrence of sequencing process-induced artifacts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Minimization of artifacts in CCS spanning SSRs within genomic DNA reveals SSR phase and length variants</title><p id="Par10">The success of calibrating the error motivated us to evaluate SSR length variation in the more complex case of the parent <italic>H. somni</italic> bacterial genome.

The two-step filter was applied to CCS that mapped to these SSRs, adjusting the FBC z-score independently for each of the five repeat regions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The histograms of all five SSR have dominant modes at the consensus SSR length (cSSRlen) depicted in the genome assembly, consistent with the consensus assembly representing the most common number of RU. SSR lengths representing integer changes of RU number, consistent with an SSM model of SSR length variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, are evident after applying the filters to reduce sequencing process-induced artifact and indicate that SSR lengths are best represented by a probability metric rather than a static single length measure.

We conclude that SSM can affect the breadth of the SSR length populations (e.g. Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref> vs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>), the skew of SSR length populations (e.g. Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref> vs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>), and the relative occupancy of different subpopulations (e.g. Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref> vs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a,c,e,g</xref>). The effect of strain or environmental conditions (e.g. culture medium) on these characteristics may provide further insight into the role of genome plasticity on adapability. The effect of the sequence context on SSM cannot be determined from the single isolate examined, but we note that the 250&#x02009;bp SSR is of low complexity (containing only A and C) which we speculate may be related to the increased SSM rate observed.</p><p id="Par12">The positions of the five tetranucleotide repeats relative to annotated features of the genome assembly (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> panels b,d,f,h,j) identify four that overlap open reading frames (ORF). One overlaps the carboxy-terminal end of a glycosyl transferase coding region, the other three overlap hypothetical protein ORF. The potential biological impact of SSR variation was examined by analysis of the 250-bp cSSRlen repeat (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref>) and the overlapping ORF encoding hypothetical protein BTV18_08055 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2j</xref>). The hypothetical protein has predicted function as a choline kinase according to BLASTX analysis against the RefSeq Proteins database. Changes in the RU number of this SSR can introduce frame shifts in the protein coded by the predicted transcript, potentially affecting function. Choline kinases have been reported to be an important virulence factor in <italic>H. somni</italic> and other species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> thus, the modulation of SSR length could conceivably impact virulence.</p><p id="Par13">Two of the <italic>H. somni</italic> SSR are comprised of the same RU sequence (ACGT; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c,e</xref>), yet have substantially different SSM-mediated SSR length subpopulation frequency profiles. This could be a direct consequence of total repeat length, but we considered the possibility that it is a consequence of repeat phase (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d,f</xref>). The SSR with 107&#x02009;bp cSSRlen has phase CAGT if defined at the 5&#x02032;-end, but TCAG if defined by the 3&#x02032;-end. In contrast, the SSR with 151&#x02009;bp cSSRlen has phase TCAG defined at the 5&#x02032;-end, but GTCA if defined by the 3&#x02032;-end (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d,f</xref>). Closer examination of the 3&#x02032;-ends of these two SSRs confirms variation of CCS populations ending with TCAG (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) or GTCA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). There is insufficient evidence to definitively attribute the variation in the SSR length subpopulation distribution profiles to sequence phase difference. However, we believe this is the first demonstration of SSR sequence phase differences in association with SSM-mediated SSR length frequency distribution profiles in any organism and suggest that the phenomenon may play a role in the biology of microbial genomes.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Comparison of the 3&#x02032;-ends of CCS mapping to two SSRs comprised of ACTG RUs.

This approach may yield similar results for other SSRs with different RU sequences and lengths. This PCR-free approach was developed to characterize changes in a bacterial isolate&#x02019;s SSR length distribution(s) when subjected to an environmental perturbation, where the effects of SSR RU sequence, RU length, and genomic context will be identical between conditions, so that the effect of the perturbation on a given locus&#x02019;s SSR length distribution can be evaluated. We note that the FBC filter requires that the RU be comprised of at least 2 different bases to be effective, so a mononucleotide SSR would not be an appropriate target. The relationships between these metrics and adaptability or other biology require dedicated experiments utilizing these methods with the goal of understanding the effect of culture condition and genomic components on the observables demonstrated here. These results suggest that SSM-mediated phase variation in bacterial populations inherently contain quantifiable subpopulations, each with their own environmental fitness, whose fittest members can be tracked as they rapidly expand upon environmental perturbation providing new insights into adaptability biology. The use of control DNA duplexes is appropriate not only for single-molecule sequencing using SMRT sequencing but could be gainfully employed to assess sequencing artifact using other next-generation sequencing technologies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title><italic>Histophilus somni</italic> USDA-ARS-USMARC-63250 culture and DNA isolation</title><p id="Par15"><italic>H. somni</italic> isolates were previously sequenced using SMRT sequencing as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> for consensus genome assembly and identification of SSRs.
