UBL5 (Ubiquitin-like protein 5)/Hub1 (Homologous to ubiquitin 1), a member of the ubiquitin family, acts as a ubiquitin-like modifier on a specific target, the spliceosomal protein Snu66, in yeast and human cells. The 22<sup>nd</sup> aspartic acid (Asp22) is involved in the attachment of Hub1 to the Hub1 interaction domain (HIND) of Snu66 in yeast to modulate spliceosomal activity. Hub1 differs from other modifiers which interact covalently with their targets. It modulates pre-mRNA splicing by binding to Snu66 non-covalently in both yeast and human cells. However, the molecular mechanisms of Hub1-mediated pre-mRNA splicing in plant systems remains unclear. To better understand the function of Hub1 in plants, we examined the role of this ubiquitin-like modifier in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, which has two Hub1 homologues. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> UBL5/Hub1(UBL5) is highly conserved at the amino acid level, compared to eukaryotic homologues in both plants and animals. In this study, phenotypic analysis of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> with reduced <italic>UBL5</italic> gene expression, generated by RNA interference of <italic>AtUBL5a</italic> and <italic>AtUBL5b</italic> were performed. Interestingly, knock down plants of AtUBL5 showed abnormalities in root elongation, plant development, and auxin response. <italic>AtUBL5b</italic> is highly expressed in the vascular tissue of the leaf, stem, and root tissue. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that AtUBL5a and AtUBL5b interact with the putative splicing factor AtPRP38 through its C-terminal domain (AtPRP38C). Knock down of <italic>AtUBL5b</italic> resulted in a pattern of insufficient pre-mRNA splicing in several introns of <italic>AtCDC2</italic>, and in introns of <italic>IAA1</italic>, <italic>IAA4</italic>, and <italic>IAA5</italic>. Defects of pre-mRNA splicing in an <italic>AtPRP38</italic> mutant resulted in an insufficient pre-mRNA splicing pattern in the intron of <italic>IAA1</italic>. Based on these results, we showed that AtUBL5b positively regulates plant root elongation and development through pre-mRNA splicing with AtPRP38C in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22120007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nishimura</surname><given-names>Mikio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by KAKENHI, Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research to K.Y.

Research on yeast and human homologous to ubiquitin 1 (Hub1, also known as Ubl5) protein led to the discovery of Hub1-dependent splicing processes [<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Conditional <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> mutants containing a temperature-sensitive <italic>Hub1</italic> allele display pre-mRNA splicing defects at high temperatures [<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Misha et al observed unusual splicing of 5&#x02032; splicing sites (5&#x02032;-ss) at noncanonical sequences in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. They found that splicing of the highly conserved 5&#x02032;-ss (GUAUGU) proceeds in a Hub1-independent manner, but splicing of the alternative 5&#x02032;-ss sequences occurs in a Hub1-dependent manner [<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Hub1 binding to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> Snu66 (ScSnu66) affects the interaction with spliceosomal proteins and splicing [<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Spliceosomes that lack Hub1 cannot recognize noncanonical 5&#x02032;-ss and are defective in alternative splicing of <italic>Steroid receptor coactivator 1</italic> (<italic>SRC1)</italic> in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0224795.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In most organisms, pre-mRNA processing at noncanonical splice sites results in intron retention, exon skipping, or alternative splicing products. However, because of the functions of Hub1 and ScSnu66, the unusual pre-mRNA processing events are maintained at a low rate. Hub1 also binds to the DEAD-box helicase Pre-mRNA Processing 5 (Prp5), a key regulator of early spliceosome assembly, through a second functional interaction surface on Hub1, which is different from the Hub1 interaction domain (HIND) [<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The interaction with Hub1 stimulates the ATPase activity of Prp5, which results in improved splicing efficiency, but it also decreases splicing fidelity and increases mis-splicing [<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Knockout of Hub1 causes reduction in pre-mRNA splicing, and depletion of Hub1 reduces viability in human cells [<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Hub1 depletion also elicits phenotypic abnormalities such as splicing speckle and mitotic defects, culminating in caspase-mediated apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Hub1 has important functions as a modulator of spliceosome activity and a facilitator for alternative splicing in both animal and yeast cells [<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, Hub1 was identified by screening for genes implicated in the unfolded protein response in mitochondria [<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> and mammalian Hub1 associate with the DVE-1 transcription factor, which is responsible for initiating the unfolded protein response pathway in mitochondria [<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Hub1 would therefore be involved during the stress response to process pre-mRNA into mRNA. Hub1 is a small ubiquitin-like protein that has ~20% sequence identity with ubiquitin, and is homologous to other ubiquitin family proteins, including SUMO and RUB [<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0224795.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0224795.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Hub1 does not have the common C-terminal di-glycine motif, which is conserved among ubiquitin-like proteins and binds covalently to an amino group in their target proteins [<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0224795.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0224795.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The C-terminal domain of Hub1 is not important for target binding; rather, it is the 22<sup>nd</sup> aspartic acid (Asp22) that is involved in the attachment of Hub1 to the HIND of Snu66 in yeast and human cells [<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0224795.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, although Hub1 is homologous to ubiquitin-like modifiers, it acts via a unique mechanism and represents a distinctive functional ubiquitin-like modifier system.</p><p>In contrast with the relatively well-known functions of Hub1 in animals and yeast, the biological role of Hub1 in plants remains unclear. Two genes, <italic>AtUBL5a</italic> and <italic>AtUBL5b</italic>, are identified in the genome of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and have amino acid sequences with high similarity to Hub1 proteins in yeast and humans. Intriguingly, in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>, Snu66 does not have a HIND, while AtPRP38, which is another component of the spliceosome complex, possesses a HIND in its C-terminal region. In perennial ryegrass (<italic>Lolium perenne</italic> L.), overexpression of LpHub1 improves drought tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although the exact mechanism has not been experimentally assessed, improved stress tolerance in plants overexpressing LpHub1 was attributed to the regulation of signaling pathways associated with the stress response [<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Auxin plays several important roles in the stress response, and plant growth and development, such as primary root elongation and lateral root development [<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Transport inhibitor response 1/Auxin related F-box (TIR1/AFB) proteins are auxin receptors that are composed of a ubiquitin protein ligase E3 complex called SCF, which directs auxin/indole 3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA) to the ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway [<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0224795.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Aux/IAA genes are expressed early in the auxin response, and encode short-lived nuclear proteins that regulate the auxin response in higher plants.</p><p>To examine the mechanism of action and the biological function of UBL5 in higher plants, we used <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RNAi to knockdown the gene expression of <italic>AtUBL5a</italic> and <italic>AtUBL5b</italic>. We evaluated the effect of AtUBL5 knockdown on plant development and response to auxin. We investigated the interaction of AtUBL5b with a HIND containing protein, the C-terminal region of AtPRP38, using two-hybrid systems. Finally, we assessed pre-mRNA splicing defects in <italic>AtCDC2</italic> and <italic>IAA</italic> genes in plants with suppressed <italic>AtUBL5b</italic> expression. In the present study, we demonstrated that AtUBL5 interacts with the HIND of AtPRP38C, and regulates root elongation and development by modulating pre-mRNA splicing in <italic>AtUBL5</italic> knockdown <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>. AtUBL5 might work as a positive regulator of root elongation and development by regulating pre-mRNA splicing together with AtPRP38.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec002"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Identification and subcellular localization of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> UBL5</title><p>There are two yeast Hub1 homologues in the genome of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> genome, which are designated as <italic>AtUBL5a</italic> (At3g45180) and <italic>AtUBL5b</italic> (At5g42300) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224795.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Using database searching, we identified yeast Hub1 homologues in several model organisms. <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> and <italic>Zea mays</italic> have three and two Hub1 homologues in their genomes, respectively, whereas other model plants, animals, and yeast have a single Hub1 homologue in their genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224795.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). As a result of duplication of Hub1, plant Hub1 might have different roles or redundancy in model organisms like <italic>O</italic>. <italic>sativa</italic>. Each <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Hub1 homologue might be involved in different biological processes in higher plants. Hub1 is essential for cell viability in yeast [<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], but human cells with defective Hub1 are still viable [<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. There might be alternative pathways to compensate for defects in Hub1 in human cells. The amino acid identity was very high among Hub1 proteins from different organisms, indicating that AtUBL5 has a highly conserved role in these model systems. AtUBL5a and AtUBL5b share 94% amino acid sequence identity, and both are highly homologous to other plant UBL5 sequences. Both AtUBL5a and AtUBL5b amino acid sequences have an identity of 79% with human Hub1. Lysine (K) residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224795.g001">Fig 1</xref>, highlighted in blue) are highly conserved in several positions in the Hub1 amino acid sequence, and are necessary to assemble polyubiquitin chains [<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although there is no direct evidence, these residues might be involved in ubiquitination for further modification of Hub1 [<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, lys12 and lys28 are conserved between <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Ubiquitin-8 and AtUBL5a/b.

These residues imply the ubiquitin-specific ability to bind to Hub1 or ubiquitin. Asp22 is also highly conserved among the analyzed organisms.

These events are associated with different transcripts and lead to alternative splicing of target pre-mRNAs, which are identified by their characteristic recognition domains [<xref rid="pone.0224795.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Thus, there would be a unique selection mechanism for splicing sites in each biological system.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec007"><title>Conclusions</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report that AtUBL5 is important for plant growth and development by regulating pre-mRNA splicing at both canonical and noncanonical splice site sequences in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>. The knockdown of AtUBL5 caused developmental defects in root elongation and development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224795.g007">Fig 7</xref>). We also showed that AtUBL5 and AtPRP38 interact in a highly conserved manner via the AtPRP38 C-terminal domain, which contains the HIND. Thus, AtUBL5 plays a highly conserved regulatory role in general pre-mRNA splicing in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> by modulating AtPRP38 activity in the splicing complex. This mechanism is similar to that observed in other model systems, such as yeast and human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224795.g007">Fig 7</xref>). We also revealed that AtUBL5 regulates root elongation and lateral root development in response to auxin.</p><fig id="pone.0224795.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0224795.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Schematic model of AtUBL5 function in pre-mRNA splicing in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0224795.g007"/></fig><p>In <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>, knockdown of <italic>AtUBL5</italic> gene expression resulted in defects in lateral root development and primary root growth, indicating that AtUBL5 regulates root elongation and development in higher plants. AtUBL5b interacts with AtPRP38C, which contains the HIND. AtUBL5b concomitantly interacts with AtUBL5a. This AtUBL5-AtPRP38C interaction is critical for proper pre-mRNA splicing in root development, including regulation of the expression of responsive genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Bioinformatics and phylogenetic analysis</title><p>To identify <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> Hub1 homologues, we performed a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTp) search with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> Hub1 protein sequence within the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> genome.
