In this study, we first investigated the differential growth rates among three wastewater-processing <italic>Chlorella</italic> strains: <italic>Chlorella sorokiniana</italic> BD09, <italic>Chlorella sorokiniana</italic> BD08 and <italic>Chlorella sp</italic>. Dachan, and the previously published <italic>Chlorella sorokiniana</italic> UTEX 1602, showing us that BD09 maintains the best tolerance in synthetic wastewater. We then performed genome sequencing and analysis, resulting in a high-quality assembly for each genome with scaffold N50&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;2&#x02009;Mb and genomic completeness &#x02265;91%, as well as genome annotation with 9,668, 10,240, 9,821 high-confidence gene models predicted for BD09, BD08, and Dachan, respectively. Comparative genomics study unravels that metabolic pathways, which are involved in nitrogen and phosphorus assimilation, were enriched in the faster-growing strains. We found that gene structural variation and genomic rearrangement might contribute to differential capabilities in wastewater tolerance among the strains, as indicated by gene copy number variation, domain reshuffling of orthologs involved, as well as a ~1 Mb-length chromosomal inversion we observed in BD08 and Dachan. In addition, we speculated that an associated bacterium, <italic>Microbacterium chocolatum</italic>, which was identified within Dachan, play a possible role in synergizing nutrient removal. Our three newly sequenced <italic>Chlorella</italic> genomes provide a fundamental foundation to understand the molecular basis of abiotic stress tolerance in wastewater treatment, which is essential for future genetic engineering and strain improvement.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Industrial microbiology</kwd><kwd>Plant genetics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>This work was funded by Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality under grant No. JCYJ20160531194327655 and No. JCYJ20151015162041454.

Excessive organic and inorganic pollutants containing nitrogen and phosphorus in wastewater without proper treatment often lead to eutrophication, oxygen depletion and ammonia toxicity to aquatic ecosystem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, therefore, wastewater management is a growing environmental challenge worldwide.</p><p id="Par3">In recent years, several biological approaches using microalgae to remove biological wastes have gained application. Microalgae is a large and diverse group of unicellular, photosynthetic, and chlorophyll-containing micro-organisms. Like plants, microalgae transmit solar energy into chemical compounds with fixed-carbons for biomass accumulation. Previous studies also showed that some green microalgae can grow in wastewater rapidly and absorb compounds containing nitrogen and phosphorus from the environment. Importantly, the algal biomass produced through such a process can be further used as feedstock, biofuel production, and for a series of by-products, such as drugs, foods, nutrition, fertilizers, and animal/fish feed supplements. Altogether, wastewater treatment by microalgae appears to be efficient for both biomass recycling and environmental protection in the piggery industry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Among various microalgae species, <italic>Chlorella</italic> (belonging to Chlorellaceae, Chlorellales, Trebouxiophyceae), a genus of green microalga with diameters varying from 5 to 10 &#x003bc;m, is nowadays widely used in wastewater treatment with several advantages: rapid growth, simple and low-cost cultivation requirements, and a proven capability for producing high-value bioproducts, biomass, and biodiesel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The great commercial potential of the <italic>Chlorella</italic> genus (hereafter referred to as <italic>Chlorella</italic>) is thus a driving force in the effort of optimizing the process flow for wastewater treatment and expanding the applications in bioproduct manufacturing. However, challenges are still ahead, one of which is that wastewater is harsh environment for most microalgal strains due to nutrient imbalance, deficiency of certain essential trace elements, and the presence of toxic compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In fact, some <italic>Chlorella</italic> strains do show good tolerance of certain wastewater environment in nature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, driving the industry to continuously seek better strains for harsher conditions, especially for extremely high nutrient imbalance and salt concentrations, and to satisfy a growing market need for more efficient production of high-value metabolites.</p><p id="Par5">One way to achieve <italic>Chlorella</italic> optimization is genetic engineering. This can be achieved by random mutagenesis followed by selection for certain target phenotypic traits or overexpression of certain transgenes with desired functions. Recently, rapidly evolved gene editing techniques make it possible for rapid and precise genetic modification for plants or algae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In order to apply such an engineering approach in various industrial purposes, we need to have the complete genome sequences with gene annotation information for target gene selection or genome-wide screening. However, only a few nuclear genomes of <italic>Chlorella</italic> clade are currently available in the NCBI database, including <italic>Chlorella variabilis</italic> NC64A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> (hereafter referred to as NC64A), <italic>Micractinium conductrix</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, <italic>Chlorella sorokiniana</italic> UTEX 1602<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> (hereafter referred to as UTEX 1602), and <italic>Auxenochlorella protothecoides</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, none of which has been tested in industrial wastewater. Furthermore, no genomic comparison between various <italic>Chlorella</italic> strains has been done to associate a genomic variation with a target phenotype, such as organic molecule clearance and stress-tolerance. Such a lack of knowledge in the genetics of <italic>Chlorella</italic> necessitates more efforts to obtain genomic blueprints of desirable <italic>Chlorella</italic> strains, together with various experiments on wastewater treatment.</p><p id="Par6">In this study, we generated three high-quality whole-genome assemblies of industrial <italic>Chlorella</italic> strains, including <italic>Chlorella sp</italic>. Dachan (hereafter referred to as Dachan), <italic>Chlorella sorokiniana</italic> BD09 and <italic>Chlorella sorokiniana</italic> BD08 (hereafter referred to as BD09 and BD08). The three high-quality assemblies were further annotated by combining homolog-based, <italic>ab initio</italic>, and transcriptome-based prediction approaches, resulting in high-confidence gene models with &#x0003e;90% of the genes assigned with putative functions. By comparative analyses across five <italic>Chlorella</italic> strains, we discovered a group of genes associated with nitrogen metabolism and endocytosis pathways and varied domains of nitrogen and phosphorus transporters that may contribute to nutrient clearance from wastewater. Interestingly, an associated bacterium was observed within Dachan, which had been shown to improve the nitrogen and phosphorus absorbing ability for algae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. A chromosomal inversion event was confirmed in the genomes of two industrial strains, which still awaits future test on its adaptation in wastewater tolerance. Altogether, our study provides a rich resource of genomic information for some strains of <italic>Chlorella</italic> genus and lays the foundation for genetic engineering of microalgae system to improve their capabilities for wastewater treatment and accompanied commercial values.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Comparison of growth performance in synthetic wastewater among <italic>Chlorella</italic> strains</title><p id="Par7">Our previous field trials of BD09 showed good performance in piggery wastewater treatment, with an estimation of the clearance efficiency as 72%, 88% and 61% in chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen and total phosphorus, respectively (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> for details). The nitrogen and phosphorus elements are enriched in wastewater mainly in the form of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (ammonia), NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> (nitrite), NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> (nitrate) and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3&#x02212;</sup> (orthophosphate), which are essential nutrients for <italic>Chlorella</italic> growth but may lead to abiotic stress at high concentrations. In order to comprehensively compare the performance of different <italic>Chlorella</italic> in&#x000a0;response to wastewater with rich carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in the lab, as well as to explore the underlying molecular mechanism responsible for this capability, we made one-to-one growth rate comparisons among <italic>Chlorella</italic> strains in synthetic wastewater with various concentrations of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. In addition to BD08, BD09 and Dachan, the strain <italic>Chlorella sorokiniana</italic> UTEX 1602, the draft&#x000a0;genome of which was reported recently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, was included into the growth assay as a control to facilitate further comparative genomic analyses (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Experimental assessment of the tolerance capability in synthetic wastewater.

However, when the concentrations of glucose, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> were increased to 200&#x02009;mg/L, 59.43&#x02009;mg/L and 8.78&#x02009;mg/L, respectively, which were defined as the low concentration treatment group (see Methods), Dachan and UTEX 1602 failed to grow beyond day 6, while BD08 and BD09 were only mildly affected (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b,e</xref>). When the concentrations of glucose, nitrogen and phosphorus were further increased (the&#x000a0;middle and high concentration treatment group), the growth of BD09 was least affected in comparison with other three strains in the first few days, though none of the four strains could continue to grow beyond day 5 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c&#x02013;e</xref>), indicating that the concentrations of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus are&#x000a0;major factors to suppress the growth of these <italic>Chlorella</italic> strains, while BD09 appears to show the best resistance to such abiotic stress followed by BD08.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Genome sequencing and characteristics</title><p id="Par9">In order to delineate the underlying molecular mechanism responsible for such differential growth rates among the three <italic>Chlorella</italic> in wastewater, we sequenced the whole genomes of BD09, BD08, and Dachan using a whole-genome shotgun strategy on the HiSeq platform. In total, 43.16&#x02009;Gb (799X), 43.98&#x02009;Gb (751X), and 41.09&#x02009;Gb (680X) of clean data for BD09, BD08, and Dachan, respectively, were generated after data filtering (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). K-mer frequency distribution analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> was performed to estimate the genome complexity (see Methods). The 17-mer frequency distribution curve for the three newly sequenced genomes exhibited one-fold peak, indicates that all three genomes are simple genomes with low heterozygosity rate and simple repeat content (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The estimated genome sizes of these three genomes were 55.1&#x02009;Mb for BD09, 56.5&#x02009;Mb for BD08, and 60.4&#x02009;Mb for Dachan.</p><p id="Par10">Genomes were assembled and optimized by Platanus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and then a series of evaluations was performed for assembly contiguity and completeness (see Methods). Three high-quality assemblies were finalized with a genome size of 54.0&#x02009;Mb for BD09, 58.6&#x02009;Mb for BD08, 60.4&#x02009;Mb for Dachan, respectively, highly consistent with each predicted genome size by the 17 K-mer analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The scaffold N50 sizes were 3.58&#x02009;Mb for BD09, 3.63&#x02009;Mb for BD08 and 2.58&#x02009;Mb for Dachan, and more than 94.5% of bases for BD09, 92% for BD08, and 90% for Dachan were located in scaffolds larger than 1&#x02009;Mb, which were much higher than the other genomes of <italic>Chlorella</italic> clade reported previously (71.4% for NC64A, 88.3% for UTEX 1602, and 60% for <italic>Micractinium conductrix</italic> SAG 24.880, respectively) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). The RNA-mapping rate and BUSCO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> dataset support a high assembly completeness for all three genomes, suggesting 95.7%, 95.7%, 91% of the assemblies were covered by transcriptome evidence, and 91.8%, 91.6%, 88.7% of the Chlorophyta genes were aligned to our assembled sequences&#x000a0;for BUSCO evaluation. We further assembled chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes for the newly sequenced genomes, obtaining chloroplast genome sequences of 131,724&#x02009;bp for BD09, 109,940&#x02009;bp for BD08, and 113,449&#x02009;bp for Dachan, respectively.

Endocytosis, an essential process for cells to uptake extracellular nutrition, plays a key role to balance environmental responses and intracellular metabolites. Previous reports revealed that endocytosis is involved in the coordination of transportation of phosphorus and nitrogen transportation by several mechanisms. For instance, endocytosis plays a critical regulatory role in the degradation of plasma membrane proteins, including plant phosphate transporter 1 (PHT1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

These findings open a door for further experiment to measure the capability in the absorbance and metabolism of phosphorus in these <italic>Chlorella</italic> strains.</p><p id="Par25">A symbiotic association with the bacterium <italic>Microbacterium</italic> in <italic>Chlorella</italic> is a common phenomenon in nature. A bacterial symbiont G&#x02009;+&#x02009;C gram-positive bacterium CSSB-3 was previously isolated from <italic>Chlorella sorokiniana</italic>.

Another example is a symbiotic bacterium <italic>Microbacterium sp</italic>. HJ1, isolated from <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic>, shows 99% identity with a wastewater isolated bacterium - <italic>Microbacterium kitamiense</italic>. This bacterium has been proven to promote <italic>Chlorella</italic> growth in the modified livestock wastewater<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we assembled a complete genome of the associated bacterium <italic>Microbacterium chocolatum</italic> that also belongs to <italic>Microbacterium</italic> genus in Dachan. <italic>Microbacterium chocolatum</italic> and <italic>Microbacterium kitamiense</italic> shares an identity over 99% as measured by 16&#x02009;S rRNA genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In contrast, we did not observe an associated or symbiotic bacterium in BD08 or BD09. The possible reason was that Dachan was originally isolated from sewage, and adaptively cultured in wastewater or BG11 without sterilization, while both BD08 and BD09 were originated from a lab strain after long time culture which requires a bacterial free environment. When the associated bacterium was removed from our synthetic wastewater by antibiotics treatment, the wastewater tolerance of Dachan was dramatically reduced, while that of BD08 and BD09 remains the same, suggesting that diverse strategies and mechanisms may exist for <italic>Chlorella</italic> to grow in industrial environments.</p><p id="Par26">Chromosomal inversion events were observed at the same region in both BD08 and Dachan, two independent strains with different origins. Such an inversion event was not found in BD09 or UTEX 1602, although they share the same origin with BD08, suggesting that the inversion region may be a rearrangement hotspot, and has been acquired independently by BD08 and Dachan. More interestingly, this 1&#x02009;Mb region was totally absent in NC64A, the strain that was much less tolerant to industrial wastewater culture, posing a possibility that the structural alteration of this region is related to stress tolerance (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Further analyses of genes in this inversion region indicated an enrichment of pathways involved in DNA repair and homologous recombination (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>). Further experiments on the expression levels of genes in this region, as well as the maintenance of genome stability under various stress conditions, will be interesting to conduct in order to determine the biological significance of this genomic rearrangement event.</p><p id="Par27">Overall, our comparative genomics analysis provides some clues to associate the potential genotype with phenotypes of interest in our wastewater-tolerance <italic>Chlorella</italic> experiment. We found that some metabolic pathways such as nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism were enriched in the newly sequenced industrial strains, indicating a potential molecular basis for their tolerance in wastewater. Investigation of genes related with nitrogen and phosphorus assimilation provides insights into the underlying molecular mechanism responsible for nutrient removal in wastewater. Furthermore, a chromosomal inversion event and associated bacterium, might also contribute to the genetic adaption of wastewater tolerance and stress adaption. The genome data and analyses presented in this study thus provides a fundamental resource for future studies on wastewater tolerance, secondary carotenoid accumulation, and algal stress biology, and will also pave a way for precise genome editing in target microalgal strains to engineeringly improve particular functionality in wastewater treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Microalgal strains and culture system</title><p id="Par28">Three industrial <italic>Chlorella</italic> genus strains were provided by Green Pac Bio Co (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.greenpacbio.com/">http://www.greenpacbio.com/</ext-link>), a biotechnology company aiming to develop new biological approaches for piggery wastewater treatment. <italic>Chlorella sp</italic>.
