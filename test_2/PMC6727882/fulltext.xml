However, whilst several studies have described the various mutations that frequently arise in clinical isolates of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, the environmental factors governing the emergence of these genetic variants is less well characterized. Gastro-oesophageal reflux has recently emerged as a major co-morbidity in CF and is often associated with the presence of bile acids in the lungs most likely by (micro) aspiration. In order to investigate whether bile may select for genetic variants, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was experimentally evolved in artificial sputum medium, a synthetic media resembling environmental conditions found within the CF lung. Pigmented derivatives of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> emerged exclusively in the presence of bile. Genome sequencing analysis identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in quorum sensing (<italic>lasR</italic>) and both the pyocyanin (<italic>phzS</italic>) and pyomelanin (<italic>hmgA</italic>) biosynthetic pathways. Phenotypic analysis revealed an altered bile response when compared to the ancestral <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> progenitor strain. While the recovered pigmented derivatives retained the bile mediated suppression of swarming motility and enhanced antibiotic tolerance, the biofilm, and redox responses to bile were abolished in the adapted mutants. Though loss of pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) production in the pigmented isolates was not linked to the altered biofilm response, the loss of redox repression could be explained by defective alkyl-quinolone (AQ) production in the presence of bile. Collectively, these findings suggest that the adaptive variants of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> that arise following long term bile exposure enables the emergence of ecologically competitive sub-populations. Altered pigmentation and AQ signaling may contribute to an enhancement in fitness facilitating population survival within a bile positive environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic></kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd><kwd>pigmented</kwd><kwd>chronic</kwd><kwd>quorum sensing</kwd><kwd>bile</kwd><kwd>artificial sputum media</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Enterprise Ireland<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001588</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">CF-2017-0757-P</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">IP-2015-0390</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Health Research Board<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100010414</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">MRCG-2018-16</award-id><award-id rid="cn002">MRCG-2014-6</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn003">European Commission<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000780</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn003">EU2020-634486-2015</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn004">Science Foundation Ireland<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001602</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn004">SFI09/RFP/BMT2350</award-id><award-id rid="cn004">SSPC-2</award-id><award-id rid="cn004">15/TIDA/2977</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn005">Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001596</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn005">GOIPG/2014/647</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn006">Cystic Fibrosis Foundation<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000897</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn006">OG1710</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="65"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic respiratory disease poses a major societal challenge, with the rapid onset of the post-antibiotic era representing a serious threat to the clinical management of infections associated with these conditions (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Burney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">GBD 2015 Chronic Respiratory Disease Collaborators, 2017</xref>). As is often the case, the development of chronic microbial infections results in a shift in clinical regimens wherein these infections are no longer treatable using conventional antibiotics. Therefore, understanding the factors that contribute to respiratory pathogen&#x02019;s ability to shift from acute to chronic infections is of paramount importance in order to identify alternative interventions and reduce the global reliance on antibiotics.</p><p>Cystic fibrosis (CF), resulting from a mutation of the Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, is the most common inherited disease in Caucasians affecting over 70,000 people worldwide (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cutting, 2015</xref>). The prognosis for this life-limiting autosomal recessive disorder has improved considerably in recent years, largely due to advances in clinical management and the development of new therapeutic interventions. However, challenges remain for the successful implementation of these innovative therapies. Principal among these is maintaining health and lung function in pediatric patients. Lower respiratory infections, even from as early as the first weeks of life, are strongly associated with the development of pulmonary inflammation and bronchiectasis (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Stick et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Ramsey et al., 2014</xref>). Early acquisition of respiratory pathogens including <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and the subsequent colonization by <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is associated with clinical decline and increased mortality (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Pittman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Caudri et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> acquisition often occurs early in life with the median age of initial detection around 2 years of age. Reports of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> positive cultures in patients as young as 3 months of age have also emerged (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Douglas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Mott et al., 2012</xref>). Early eradication has been associated with reduced prevalence of chronic <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infections in later life (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Taccetti et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, ensuring the successful eradication of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is of paramount importance in CF care.</p><p>The pathogen-centric focus to respiratory infections has been challenged somewhat in recent years with the advent of next generation sequencing technologies. Genomics based studies have uncovered richly diverse microbial communities in the lungs of both healthy individuals and hospitalized patients, with perturbations in these populations implicated in many disease conditions (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Douglas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Muhlebach et al., 2018</xref>). Micro-evolution of pathogens within these diverse communities has also received considerable attention with a growing appreciation for the extent of phenotypic heterogeneity present within these populations (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Workentine et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Darch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Grote et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Jorth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Davies et al., 2017</xref>). The ability of pathogens to adapt and adopt multiple forms facilitates persistence and colonization in challenging niches such as the lungs of patients with respiratory disease. Mutations in key signaling pathways e.g., LasR are particularly prevalent among <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> clinical isolates (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Hoffman et al., 2009</xref>), with pigmented variants also reported in several studies (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Mowat et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, re-wiring of regulatory networks in these clinical isolates has also been uncovered, suggesting a complex adaptive response to environmental challenges (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Feltner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). These changes can lead to phase dependent alterations in virulence (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Cabeen, 2014</xref>). To enhance early treatment strategies of lung disease in CF, improvements in our understanding of factors that contribute to both pathogen acquisition and dysbiosis of the lower respiratory microbiota is essential.</p><p>Bile acids, one of the major components of bile, have been detected in the lungs of patients with respiratory disease, and have been shown to correlate directly with increased morbidity and colonization by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Zecca et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Blondeau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Pauwels et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Reen et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). This is further supported by several independent studies that show a correlation between bile reflux and pathogen colonization in patients with CF (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">van der Doef et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Palm et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Al-Momani et al., 2016</xref>), with evidence of increased inflammation and lung impairment also reported (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Pauwels et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, both bile and bile acids have been shown to modulate the behavioral lifestyle of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> causing it to adopt a chronic biofilm lifestyle (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Reen et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). This would appear to occur through transcriptional rewiring of the cell, with changes in virulence systems, signaling molecules, and key metabolic pathways including the glyoxylate shunt observed (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Reen et al., 2016</xref>). While we have uncovered key insights into the mechanisms through which bile influences the behavior of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, little is known about how the pathogen responds to long term exposure to bile challenge. This would be of particular interest considering the temporal nature of aspiration and its emerging role in shaping the microbiology of the lungs (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Dickson et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>This study was designed to assess the response of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to long-term bile exposure. Increased production of pyocyanin (PYO) was initially observed and confirmed by transcriptional analysis. Over time, pigmented morphologies were observed exclusively in bile treated cultures. Characterization of these mutants revealed a loss of AQ signaling and PYO production with whole genome sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis revealing key genetic changes in the pigmented variants. These changes included point mutations in the quorum sensing regulator <italic>lasR</italic>. Although these pigmented mutants retained their response to bile with respect to antibiotic tolerance and swarming motility, they were notably unresponsive for biofilm formation and redox potential response, possibly due to defective AQ production. These findings implicate a role for AQs in the bile induced shift in redox potential with additional unidentified factors likely to be involved in the altered biofilm response to bile on the pigmented mutants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>Bacterial Culture</title><p>All cultures of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> were routinely grown in Tryptic soy broth (TSB) media or Luria-Bertani broth (LB) with shaking at 180 rpm at 37&#x000b0;C.

Therefore, we investigated the impact of bile on PYO production in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 grown in ASM, a growth medium that is known to mimic conditions found within the CF lung environment.</p><p>Bile, at various sub-inhibitory concentrations was shown to significantly increase production of PYO in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in ASM when compared to untreated cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Induction was evident at 24 h incubation but was most pronounced at 96 h in the presence of 3% (w/v) bile. At 24 h, concentrations of pyocyanin went from 7.59 &#x003bc;g/mL in the absence of bile to 8.82, 9.85, and 9.01 &#x003bc;g/mL in the presence of 0.03, 0.3, and 3% (w/v) bile, respectively.

This suggests that there may be some fitness cost preventing them from outcompeting the progenitor wild-type phenazine producing genotype within the population. In contrast to the bile treated ASM cultures, the majority of colonies obtained from untreated ASM appear to either retain green pigmentation, most likely a result of intact phenazine production, or lose pigmentation completely (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>).

This single base pair mutation was also located in the <italic>hmgA</italic> gene of the two other brown pigmented variants tested, as confirmed by sequencing of PCR amplicons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>).

The production of a red pigment in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> has previously been reported for <italic>phzS</italic> mutants, suggesting that this insertion underpins the pigmentation the red variant (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>). The insertion of a C nucleotide at position 125 resulted in a+1 frameshift mutation which was confirmed by PCR sequencing and extended to all other red variants tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, subsequent plating of red pigmented variants consistently led to loss of pigmentation in a subset of colonies. Sequencing of these colonies revealed reversion back to the original ancestral sequence. This is consistent with previous studies describing a high frequency of reversion for +1 frameshift mutations in a <italic>mutS</italic> mutant (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Smania et al., 2004</xref>). This finding validated that insertion of the single C nucleotide into the <italic>phzS</italic> sequence was responsible for production of the red pigment in these mutants. Additionally, pigment extraction and preparative TLC analysis from a <italic>phzS</italic> transposon mutant and the red derivative further reinforced these findings with an RF value of 0.92 obtained for both the <italic>phzS</italic> mutant and the red pigmented isolate. While the potential causative mutations could be identified for the red and brown pigmented variants, no likely mutation could be located that could underpin production of the yellow pigment. The <italic>phzM</italic> gene and upstream regions including the promoter region were unchanged in all strains. It is possible that another mutation within the genome has affected the expression of <italic>phzM</italic> and therefore production of the yellow pigment could still be attributed to altered <italic>phzM</italic> expression.

All three red pigmented variants were found to be swarming mutants, as was the case for the <italic>phzS</italic> transposon mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>mutS</italic> transposon mutant exhibited wild-type swarming motility which was suppressed in the presence of bile.

However, little is known about the consequences for longer term exposure to bile in these organisms and the nature of the adaptation that might occur. Therefore, in this study we performed a growth cycling experiment with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cultured in ASM in the presence and absence of bile, a synthetic media designed to more closely mimic conditions encountered within the sputum rich CF lung. This revealed that global adaptation to bile resulted in enhanced biofilm formation with mutations occurring in signaling systems and <italic>lasR</italic> genes underpinning the emergence of pigmented derivatives.</p><p>Phenazine production has been shown to enhance anaerobic survival in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Glasser et al., 2014</xref>), while phenazines have also been shown to influence the physiology of host cells and competing organisms. Production of the phenazine pigment PYO was significantly increased in response to bile in ASM cultures after 24 and 96 h. The increased levels of PYO in the cultures were found to be toxic to the growth of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. This key virulence factor contributes to the pathogenicity of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with significant quantities of this redox-active molecule recovered from the lungs of infected CF patients (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Caldwell et al., 2009</xref>). The production of PYO is under control of the quorum sensing signaling system and its production involves two distantly encoded biosynthetic operons (<italic>phzA-G</italic>), as well as the modification genes <italic>phzH/M/S.</italic> Several studies have linked production of PYO to redox and virulence processes in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Dietrich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Price-Whelan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Meirelles and Newman, 2018</xref>). PYO has been shown to cause direct damage to human host cells, inhibiting cellular respiration and inducing neutrophil apoptosis (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Manago et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Heirali et al., 2016</xref>). The importance of PYO was demonstrated in both acute and chronic mouse models, where PYO mutants were less competitive than their wild-type counterparts. PYO is known to play an important role in the establishment of biofilms in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. It is responsible for extracellular DNA release resulting from auto-poisoning and cell death (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Das and Manefield, 2012</xref>), while also promoting survival of oxidant limited cells within biofilms (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Meirelles and Newman, 2018</xref>). PYO has also been shown to enhance biofilm formation through second messenger c-di-GMP signaling and its ability to serve as an alternative terminal electron acceptor within the hypoxic biofilm. A recent study by Meirelles et al. has shown that PYO production may have both toxic and beneficial effects (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Meirelles and Newman, 2018</xref>), analogous in some ways to the role proposed for PQS by <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Haussler and Becker (2008)</xref>. PYO-tolerant sub-populations were shown to emerge from nutrient-limited biofilms. In contrast, a susceptible population was sacrificed for eDNA release and structural support in a &#x0201c;net-benefit&#x0201d; arrangement for the population. It is possible therefore that the emergence of pigmented variants that no longer produce PYO following long term exposure to bile, is an adaptation mechanism within the population to the elevated &#x0201c;toxic&#x0201d; levels encountered in the bile positive artificial sputum environment. Elevated toxic levels of PYO may contribute to the selection of a sub-population of PYO defective mutants within the ASM bile microenvironment. Further study is required to elucidate the impact of enhanced pyocyanin production within a bile positive CF lung on the evolutionary trajectory of residing <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> populations.</p><p>The occurrence of pigmented variants within the lungs of patients with respiratory disease has been reported for decades (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Meader et al., 1925</xref>; <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Wahba, 1965</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Hocquet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Ketelboeter and Bardy, 2017</xref>). Distinction between red and brown pigmented clinical isolates was complicated further by the observation of some isolates that turned from &#x0201c;yellowish to red&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Gessard, 1920</xref>). Advances in sequencing and high throughput screening technologies have reinforced the finding that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> populations within the lungs of patients with CF are not uniform, but rather display a remarkable level of genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Brien et al., 2017</xref>). The rationale underpinning the function of these pigmented mutants within lung populations remains to be understood. In our study, while maintained within the growth cycled populations in bile treated ASM, neither the brown nor the red pigmented mutants ever exceeded more than 10% of the population. This would suggest that their function may be crucial in maintaining a PYO positive population of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Reversion of some colonies following subsequent culturing of red pigmented variants would support this hypothesis. Indeed, the frequency of red pigmented variants in clinical samples is low, ranging from 3.5&#x02013;6% (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Ogunnariwo and Hamilton-Miller, 1975</xref>). Brown pyomelanin pigmented variants have been reported at higher frequencies of up to 13% in chronically infected CF patients (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Mayer-Hamblett et al., 2014</xref>). The selective pressure underpinning the emergence of these pigmented variants in the lungs, urinary tract, and wounds of patients&#x02019; remains to be determined. Increased persistence through maintenance of redox-balanced populations within biofilms (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Meirelles and Newman, 2018</xref>), intraspecific competition through production of pyocins (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Hocquet et al., 2016</xref>), and tolerance to oxidative stress (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez-Rojas et al., 2009</xref>), may all contribute to the necessity for these pigmented sub-populations.</p><p>The quorum sensing AQ signaling system is an effective strategy utilized by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> allowing a coordinated gene expression response at the population level. This level of regulation serves as an additional global mechanism of adaptation to external stimuli and has been demonstrated to play a role in both virulence factor production and biofilm formation (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Dubern and Diggle, 2008</xref>). The pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) has been shown to exert differential effects on individual members of communities of <italic>P. aeruginosa.</italic> It is capable of both sensitizing cells to external stresses and also inducing effective stress responses (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Haussler and Becker, 2008</xref>). The presence of high levels of PQS has been shown to induce cellular autolysis whilst remaining unaffected cells are triggered to transition to a reduced metabolic and increased PQS tolerant state. The synergy between this selective impact on a population and the recent findings related to the action of PYO on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> populations is intriguing and points to a concerted control of populations. As with PYO, PQS represents a central factor in the modulation of population structure and adaptation. The red pigmented derivative was shown to be defective in the production of PQS but not its precursor HHQ, possibly as a consequence of changes in <italic>lasR</italic> sequence. As with the loss of PYO production in a subpopulation of cells, the global reduction of the PQS signaling molecule may represent a successful strategy offsetting any negative effects resulting from over production in a sputum rich environment. The proposed concentration dependent &#x0201c;housekeeping&#x0201d; function of PQS and pyocyanin, whereby both positive and detrimental effects on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> communities have been reported are consistent with the emergence of sub-populations in response to extended bile exposure. The molecular mechanisms underlying the emergence of these variants and the collective contribution of each pigmented strain on the persistence of the community as a whole will be the focus of further study to better understand the pathogenesis of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in the lungs of patients with respiratory disease. Furthermore, taking cognizance of the phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity that exists within <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> communities in the lung, extension of this study to model (e.g., wild-type PAO1 and PA14) and clinical strains will inform whether the adaptive trajectories described here will also be observed within natural populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S5"><title>Data Availability</title><p>The datasets generated for this study can be found in NCBI, PRJNA535434.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>FR and FO&#x02019;G conceived the study and supervised the research.
