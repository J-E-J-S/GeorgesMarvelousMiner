Gemcitabine is administered as a pro-drug and the only reported mechanism for its cellular uptake is transportation by human nucleoside transporter proteins SLC28A1, SLC28A3, SLC29A1 and SLC29A2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Once inside the cell, gemcitabine is phosphorylated to gemcitabine mono-, di- and tri-phosphate by deoxycytidine kinase, cytidine/uridine monophosphate kinase 1 and nucleoside diphosphate kinase, respectively. Subsequently, gemcitabine triphosphate is incorporated into the DNA chain by DNA polymerases and causes &#x0201c;masked chain termination&#x0201d; of DNA replication. In this mechanism, DNA replication is halted following incorporation of one base after gemcitabine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and thereby triggers cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, gemcitabine diphosphate influences DNA synthesis by reducing dNTP pool of the cells via covalent binding to the active site of ribonucleotide reductase and its consequent inactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

The best prediction for SH3D21 biological function was purine ribonucleoside triphosphate catabolic process. Given that gemcitabine needs to be processed to gemcitabine triphosphate inside the cells in order to act as an active drug<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> this result is strongly in conformance with <italic>SH3D21</italic> gemcitabine sensitizing action. Further studies are required to confirm whether the catabolic activity of SH3D21 on gemcitabine triphosphate is the mechanism by which SH3D21 attenuates gemcitabine effect or other mechanisms are involved.</p><p id="Par19">In previous RNAi-based screenings, <italic>CHEK1</italic>, <italic>VDR</italic> and <italic>RAD17</italic> have been introduced as gemcitabine sensitizers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, these genes did not show up among the top gemcitabine sensitizer candidates in our study. This might be due to the difference in mechanisms of action of knockout (CRISPR/Cas) and knockdown (RNAi) screenings. The former manipulation tool completely abolishes the function of a gene while the latter causes incomplete cessation of the gene&#x02019;s function. In fact, it has been shown that compared to shRNA, CRISPR/Cas9 system produces more positive hits, 2 to 5 folds, in loss-of-function screenings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Furthermore, as G2M-chekpoint gene set appeared to be an essential gene set for the survival of Panc1 cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), with <italic>CHEK1</italic> ranked 729 in the list of essential genes, it is also possible that genes like <italic>CHEK1</italic> and <italic>RAD17</italic>, which are involved in G2M-checkpoint, were observed as top hits in previous studies due to their background effect on the cells survival.</p><p id="Par20">Four Gene Ontology gene sets were enriched in the gemcitabine-treated cells (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9</xref>), meaning their leading genes may act as positive regulator of gemcitabine.

The viral protein category that showed a significant increase in top 1000 enriched genes compared to the entire library (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) was composed of three genes, of which two were involved in cell division, <italic>CEP250</italic> and <italic>CEP135</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. These results indicate that an intact cell division machinery might be important for mechanism of action of gemcitabine in Panc1 cell line. The importance of the intact cell division machinery is in accordance with previous observation that cell cycle arrest is the major gemcitabine mode of action within ninety-six hours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">The proportion of the proteins with transporter activity was decreased in top 1000 depleted genes compared to those of the entire library (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a,b</xref>). Of four known gemcitabine transporters only <italic>SLC28A3</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> was absent among top 1000 depleted genes and present among top 1000 enriched genes. The other known gemcitabine transporters failed to show this pattern. On the other hand, one of the three viral genes that were enriched in gemcitabine-treated cells was <italic>ERVFRD-1</italic>, which is involved in endosomal transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. These results increased the possibility of participation of other transporting molecules/mechanisms, e.g. endocytosis, in gemcitabine uptake by Panc1 cells. To test this hypothesis, we made use of an endocytosis inhibitor, chlorpromazine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, and observed that the effect of gemcitabine was attenuated in the presence of chlorpromazine (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). To reassure the inhibitory effect of chlorpromazine on endocytosis, we evaluated the internalization of fluorescent dextran to the Panc1 cells in the presence of chlorpromazine (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). These data confirm that endocytosis is also involved in gemcitabine cellular uptake alongside its known transportation mechanism by transporter proteins.</p><p id="Par22">In brief, we found that <italic>SH3D21</italic> is a gemcitabine sensitizer and may act as a novel therapeutic target to improve gemcitabine efficacy. Also, MYC pathway appeared as an essential pathway for the survival of Panc1 cells in our study and might serve as a target for treatment of pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, we found that endocytosis is involved in gemcitabine cellular uptake, a finding that may help planning new strategies for gemcitabine delivery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Cell culture and gemcitabine</title><p id="Par23">Human pancreatic cancer Panc1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma R8758) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in corning plates.
