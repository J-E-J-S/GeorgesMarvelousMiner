PG hydrolases play essential roles in remodeling this three-dimensional network during growth and division but how these autolytic enzymes are regulated remains poorly understood. The FtsEX ABC transporter-like complex has emerged as a broadly conserved regulatory module in controlling cell wall hydrolases in diverse bacterial species. In most characterized examples, this complex regulates distinct PG hydrolases involved in cell division and is intimately associated with the cytokinetic machinery called the divisome.

To investigate whether additional factors are required for FtsEX function outside the divisome, we performed a synthetic lethal screen taking advantage of the conditional essentiality of CwlO. This screen identified two uncharacterized factors (SweD and SweC) that are required for CwlO activity. We demonstrate that these proteins reside in a membrane complex with FtsX and that amino acid substitutions in residues adjacent to the ATPase domain of FtsE partially bypass the requirement for them. Collectively our data indicate that SweD and SweC function as essential co-factors of FtsEX in controlling CwlO during cell wall elongation. We propose that factors analogous to SweDC function to support FtsEX activity outside the divisome in other bacteria.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Bacterial growth and division require the synthesis and remodeling of the cell wall exoskeleton.

This macromolecule is assembled from long glycan strands cross-linked together by attached peptides, generating a continuous three-dimensional meshwork that encapsulates the cytoplasmic membrane, specifies cell shape, and protects the cell from its internal turgor pressure [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Bacterial growth and division are intimately linked to hydrolysis of this covalently closed exoskeleton. To enlarge this meshwork during growth, bonds connecting the glycan strands must be broken to allow expansion of the meshwork and/or to incorporate new strands between the existing ones [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Similarly, during cell division, bonds must be broken in the nascent septal PG to allow invagination of the outer membrane in gram-negative bacteria and to promote cell separation in gram-positive bacteria. PG hydrolases play a central role in these processes, but their activities must be tightly regulated to prevent excessive degradation of the cell wall and the generation of lethal breaches in this protective layer. Many of the enzymes responsible for cell growth and division have been identified in a growing number of bacteria [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the mechanisms by which they are regulated remain incompletely understood. A deeper understanding of these regulatory systems has the potential to reveal new ways to subvert PG biogenesis for therapeutic intervention [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Progress in our understanding of the control of PG hydrolysis comes from studies of the broadly conserved FtsEX complex. This substrate-less ABC transporter has been found to regulate distinct PG hydrolases in diverse bacterial species including <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic>, <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic>, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, and <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. FtsEX is a member of the Type VII ABC transporter superfamily that is thought to function in mechanotransmission rather than as transporters [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. FtsE is the ATPase and FtsX is the transmembrane domain subunit of the complex. The large extracellular loops of FtsX interact with species-specific PG hydrolases that contain regulatory coiled-coil domains or, in the case of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, an activator of PG hydrolases with a regulatory coiled-coil domain. Structural studies of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> PG hydrolase PcsB that is controlled by FtsEX [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] suggest that the coiled-coil domain resembles long molecular tweezers that hold the globular PG hydrolase domain in an inactive state [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Based on structural analysis of MacB, another member of the Type VII ABC transporter superfamily [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], FtsEX is thought to function by a mechanotransmission mechanism in which the ATPase cycle of FtsE controls conformational changes in the extracellular loop domains of FtsX triggering PG hydrolase activity perhaps by releasing the catalytic domain from the clutches of its regulatory coiled-coil domain.</p><p>In most bacteria in which this conserved regulatory module has been examined, FtsEX functions in the context of cell division. In the case of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, FtsEX controls the activity of two PG amidases (AmiA and AmiB) via the coiled-coil domain-containing regulator EnvC [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. PG hydrolysis by these enzymes allows invagination of the outer membrane through the nascent septal PG layer during cytokinesis. FtsEX is intimately linked to divisome function. The complex is recruited to the cytokinetic ring at an early step in its assembly and recent work indicates that it interacts with the actin-like division protein FtsA to promote recruitment of downstream division factors [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Furthermore, ATP hydrolysis by the FtsEX complex is not only required for cell wall hydrolysis by the two amidases it is also necessary for septal PG synthesis [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] suggesting that FtsEX functions as a central coordinator of these two processes. FtsEX in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>crescentus</italic> has similarly been implicated in linking PG synthesis and its remodeling during cytokinesis [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>, FtsEX controls the PG hydrolase PcsB during cell division [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The mechanism by which FtsEX is recruited to the divisome is not known but, by analogy to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, is thought to involve interactions with divisome components like FtsA or FtsZ [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The signal(s) that stimulate cycles of ATP hydrolysis in any of these systems are currently unknown but are likely intimately linked to the onset of PG synthesis during cytokinesis.</p><p>Interestingly, in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic>, FtsEX is not involved in cell division but instead controls the PG hydrolase CwlO that plays a central role in cell wall elongation during growth [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. CwlO contains an amino-terminal coiled-coil domain followed by a NlpC/P60 D,L-endopeptidase domain that cleaves the bond between &#x003b3;-D-glutamate and meso-diaminopimelic acid within the stem peptide [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. CwlO and a second D,L-endopeptidase (LytE) [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] that is not regulated by FtsEX, are functionally redundant [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Cells lacking either of these enzymes are viable but depletion of one in the absence of the other results in a lethal block to cell wall elongation. Consistent with the idea that CwlO is controlled by FtsEX, cells lacking either FtsE or FtsX or harboring point mutations in the putative ATPase domain of FtsE are blocked for cell wall elongation upon depletion of LytE [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As in the case of the division-associated FtsEX complexes, the signals that stimulate FtsEX activity during growth are currently unknown. Here, we investigate whether other factors are required for FtsEX to function outside the multi-protein divisome complex. Taking advantage of the functional redundancy of CwlO and LytE we performed a synthetic lethal screen for mutants that require <italic>lytE</italic> for growth and identified two uncharacterized genes <italic>yqzD</italic> (<italic>sweD</italic>) and <italic>yqzC</italic> (<italic>sweC</italic>) that function in the same genetic pathway as <italic>ftsEX</italic> and <italic>cwlO</italic>. We demonstrate that SweD and SweC reside in a multimeric membrane complex with FtsX and function as essential co-factors of FtsEX in the control of CwlO activity. Orthologs of SweD and SweC are present in a subset of Bacilliaceae, Lactobacillales, and Listeriaceae suggesting these factors similarly enable FtsEX to control elongation hydrolases. Interestingly, Bernhardt and co-workers have identified two unrelated membrane proteins in <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic> that function as co-factors of the FtsEX-RipC cell wall hydrolase complex to promote cell separation in this organism. Thus, FtsEX complexes employ distinct co-factors to regulate PG hydrolases during cell division, separation, and elongation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Identification of <italic>sweD</italic> and <italic>sweC</italic></title><p>To identify additional factors required for FtsEX-CwlO function, we took advantage of the synthetic lethal relationship between <italic>cwlO</italic> and <italic>lytE</italic>.

The restoration of viability under these conditions is likely due to residual activity of FtsEX-CwlO in the absence of SweDC, because these conditions did not support growth of the &#x00394;<italic>cwlO</italic> &#x00394;<italic>lytE</italic> or &#x00394;<italic>ftsEX</italic> &#x00394;<italic>lytE</italic> double mutants (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008296.s006">S6 Fig</xref></bold>).

Based on these data and our two-hybrid analysis, we hypothesize that the SweD-SweC-FtsE-FtsX complex has a stoichiometry of 4-2-2-2. Finally, our data indicate that both SweD and SweC have conserved intracellular domains that are important for function and could therefore play roles in maintaining or regulating the ATPase activity of FtsE; directly sensing a signal to modulate cleavage activity; and/or linking the PG hydrolase complex to PG synthesis machinery. The identification of suppressor mutations adjacent to the ATPase domain of FtsE that partially bypass the requirement for SweDC suggests that these co-factors could indeed help maintain and/or control cycles of ATP hydrolysis. However, attempts to reconstitute ATPase activity of FtsE in vitro have thus far been unsuccessful making it difficult to directly test this model. It is also noteworthy that our data indicate that the LysM-like domain on SweC resides in the cytosol rather than facing the cell wall. Since these domains bind polysaccharides, an attractive model is that this domain functions to coordinate PG hydrolase activity with cell wall synthetic capacity by monitoring cytosolic PG precursors. In vitro reconstitution of the complex in the future will allow us to explore this and related models for SweDC function.</p><fig id="pgen.1008296.g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1008296.g008</object-id><label>Fig 8</label><caption><title>FtsEX complexes employ distinct co-factors to regulate PG hydrolysis during cell division and cell wall elongation.</title><p>Schematic models comparing the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> FtsEX-EnvC-Amidase complex that functions during division (left) with the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> SweDC-FtsEX-CwlO elongation hydrolase complex (right).

Based on ribosome profiling and our two-hybrid analysis, the stoichiometry of the SweD-SweC-FtsE-FtsX complex is proposed to be 4:2:2:2. Our analysis suggests that SweDC regulate the FtsEX ATPase activity. Genetic evidence suggests that the hydrolase complex functions in the same pathway as the peptidoglycan elongation machinery (not depicted) [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Whether this is direct or indirect is currently unknown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1008296.g008"/></fig><p>A connection between the FtsEX-CwlO PG hydrolase complex and the cell wall elongation machinery (called the Rod complex) has been proposed previously [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] but the evidence remains incomplete. Cells lacking LytE but not FtsEX or CwlO were found to have a synthetic growth defect when the actin-like protein Mbl was depleted. Since Mbl functions as a scaffold for the Rod complex, these data suggest that CwlO, FtsEX, Mbl and by extension the rest of the cell wall elongation machinery are in the same genetic pathway [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We detect similar growth defects when Mbl is depleted in a &#x00394;<italic>lytE</italic> mutant and the absence of significant growth defects when Mbl is depleted in strains lacking FtsEX, CwlO, or SweDC (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008296.s010">S10 Fig</xref></bold>). However, we found that a functional SweD-GFP fusion (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008296.s011">S11 Fig</xref></bold>) lacked the dynamic behavior of the Rod complex, which was shown to move in a directed and circumferential manner around the long axis of cell [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. These data suggest that the SweDC-FtsEX-CwlO complex is unlikely to be a core component of the cell wall synthetic machinery but does not exclude the possibility that the two complexes transiently interact and influence each other's activity. Consistent with this idea, formaldehyde crosslinking of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> cells followed by affinity purification of Mbl and Mass Spectrometry identified FtsX and SweC in crosslinked complexes with Mbl and separately FtsE and FtsX in crosslinked complexes with MreB [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. However, &#x0003e;65 proteins were identified in each of the crosslinked complexes making it difficult to draw strong conclusions from these findings. Finally, we note that the integral membrane protein RodZ, a core member of the Rod complex, has an intracellular HTH motif like SweD [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In the case of RodZ, this motif functions to position an adjacent helix such that it can interact with MreB [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Although we have shown that the HTH motif on SweD is important for function this domain lacks the analogous interaction helix found in RodZ. Furthermore, we did not observe an interaction between Mbl and SweD in the bacterial two-hybrid assay. Thus, it remains an open question whether the PG hydrolase activity of the SweDC-FtsEX-CwlO complex is coordinated with cell wall synthesis mediated by the Rod complex.</p><p>We note that gram-positive bacteria like <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> are thought to synthesize their cell wall via an inside to outside mechanism in which newly synthesized layers adjacent to the cell membrane are not initially load bearing [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Only as these layers migrate outward during cell growth do they experience stress. It is these more distal load-bearing layers that are likely to be the target of CwlO and LytE. Thus, the activity of these D,L-endopeptidases would not necessarily need to be directly coordinated with PG synthesis as has been proposed for gram-negative bacteria [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p><p>Finally, we return to FtsEX. This noncanonical ABC transporter is the most broadly conserved regulator of PG hydrolases. In many cases this complex is intimately associated with the divisome where it controls cell wall cleavage during cytokinesis and potentially coordinates PG hydrolysis with septal PG synthesis (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008296.g008">Fig 8</xref></bold>). Here, we establish that two co-factors SweD and SweC are critical for FtsEX function outside the divisome during cell wall elongation. Homologs of SweD and SweC are present in Bacilliaceae, Lactobacillales, and Listeriaceae species, where we propose that, like the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> co-factors, they enable FtsEX to control elongation PG hydrolases. Interestingly, work from the Bernhardt lab has uncovered a distinct set of factors that function with FtsEX in <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic>, an actinobacterium that undergoes cell separation through a mechanically driven process called V snapping [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. These two membrane proteins (SteA and SteB) are required for the FtsEX-RipC PG hydrolase complex to promote for V snapping. Thus, the identification of SweDC and SteAB reveal that the broadly conserved FtsEX regulatory module works with distinct co-factors to control PG hydrolases required for cell division, cell separation, and cell wall elongation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>General methods</title><p>All <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> strains were derived from the prototrophic strain PY79 [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].

Cells depleted of Mbl on LB agar in the presence or absence of 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> have a slow-growth phenotype. The growth defect is modestly enhanced to a similar degree in the absence of CwlO, FtsEX, or SweDC. However, in the absence of LytE, depletion of Mbl results in 4-log plating defect as reported previously [<xref rid="pgen.1008296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

Consistent with a role in regulating the elongation hydrolase CwlO, SweD-sfGFP localized in discrete foci throughout the cell membrane. The ~2-fold increased fluorescence at division sites is due to the double-membrane septum.
