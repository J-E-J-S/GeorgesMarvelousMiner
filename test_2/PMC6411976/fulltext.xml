Proteins can be biotinylated through chemical or enzymatic techniques. The chemical techniques are simple; however, they modify a broad range of chemically similar groups and therefore often lack target selectivity. Enzymatic biotinylation, on the other hand, is highly specific and is catalyzed by protein-biotin ligases. All living organisms express protein-biotin ligases, which biotinylate between 1&#x02013;5 specific proteins in their respective organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The <italic>E. coli</italic> protein-biotin ligase BirA is extremely specific and covalently attaches biotin to a single lysine in the endogenously expressed BCCP subunit of acetyl-CoA carboxylase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Additionally, a small synthetic 15-amino-acid peptide is effectively biotinylated by BirA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and fusion of the synthetic biotin acceptor peptide (AP) to a target protein creates an efficient approach for site-specific <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> biotinylation through co-expression or addition of BirA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Although the high specificity and activity of BirA towards the synthetic AP provide a powerful approach for specific labeling, the range of applications for BirA mediated biotinylation is restricted to samples containing AP-fused proteins. Development of novel BirA variants with specificity towards peptide sequences that are present in endogenously expressed proteins would therefore massively expand the application range wherein enzymatic biotinylation can be utilized.</p><p id="Par3">Directed evolution is a powerful method to evolve new protein function and involves iterations of gene mutations, isolation and amplification of gene variants with the desired function. BirA activity is readily selected and phage display technologies have been developed that allow for selection of BirA activity based on their display of biotinylated peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The strong binding of biotin to streptavidin ensures that even low abundant phages are selected, but amplification of phages requires infection a bacterial host and the phages therefore have to be eluted from the affinity resin. The elution creates a bottleneck and, as an alternative to streptavidin, low affinity monomeric avidin has been used as it allows for reversible binding of biotinylated phages and elution with biotin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The lower affinity of monomeric avidin affects the selection of biotinylated phages, and allowed only for a modest ~10-fold enrichment of BirA from phages expressing synthetic AP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. To accelerate the identification of active BirA variants, we sought to develop a selection method in which the elution step could be eliminated.</p><p id="Par4">Bacteria can be selected and enriched through magnetic beads isolation with no need for elution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and we therefore based our selection on a bacterial display system. As scaffold for peptide display, we used eCPX (enhanced circularly permuted outer membrane protein OmpX), which allow for effective display of peptides at both N- and C-termini<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The target peptide sequence is inserted into the carboxy-terminus of eCPX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> such that bacteria expressing active BirA variants biotinylate and subsequently display the biotinylated peptide on the surface (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), allowing for effective streptavidin selection. Here, we demonstrate that bacterial display of a peptide sequence is an effective approach to select for BirA variants with novel specificity.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The selection system. (<bold>a</bold>) The selection system is based on bacterial surface display in which eCPX with a terminal peptide sequence is co-expressed with an enzyme (Enz). eCPX is translocated to the bacterial cell surface. The surface display of the biotin depends on protein-biotin ligase activity. (<bold>b</bold>) The bacterial display system is based on a single plasmid encoding the 2 components: the enzyme, BirA, under the control of an arabinose-inducible promoter and eCPX under the control of the T7 promoter. (<bold>c</bold>) Bacterial transformed with randomly mutated enzyme variants (1). Following a short induction period in order to express the enzyme and eCPX with the AP (2), the bacteria are incubated with a streptavidin beads (3) and unbound bacteria are removed by extensive washing (4).

The principle of the selection system is that a library of BirA mutants is co-expressed with eCPX fused to target peptide sequence and bacteria displaying biotinylated target peptide are readily selected and amplified while bound to the streptavidin beads (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). We carried out a model selection using the BirA against its synthetic 15-amino-acid AP or its non-biotinylatable K10A sequence (AP(K10A))<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Biotinylated eCPX-AP was detected in uninduced cultures (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), indicating a low basal expression of the eCPX-AP from the T7 promoter even in the absence of IPTG and sequent biotinylation by endogenous BirA. BirA-6xHis was detected in cultures of eCPX-AP and -AP(K10A) after co-induction with arabinose and IPTG, but strong biotinylation was only detected in the eCPX-AP bacteria and not in BirA-eCPX-AP(K10A) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Effective enrichment of surfaced displayed biotinylated AP.

Western blot of the isolated streptavidin-Dynabeads incubated with bacteria displaying the synthetic AP showed intense biotinylation of eCPX-AP as well as isolation of BirA-6xHis, while both proteins were undetected in western blots of the streptavidin pull-down from eCPX-AP(K10A) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). In agreement, streptavidin precipitated viable bacteria to a higher degree in eCPX-AP cultures compared to eCPX-AP(K10A) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Thus, the results suggest that bacteria display biotinylated eCPX on surface and allows for isolation of the biotinylated AP.</p><p id="Par7">It is imperative that the selection procedure can isolate rare functional clones in the library and we therefore tested if eCPX-AP clones could be isolated after dilution into cultures of non-biotinylatable eCPX-AP(K10A) at ratios of 1:10<sup>3</sup>, 1:10<sup>6</sup>, and 1:10<sup>9</sup>.

After the last selection round, 10 randomly selected clones were tested by western blotting for their ability to biotinylate the displayed peptide sequences.

We obtained the full-length DNA sequence a randomly selected clone displaying TagRFP (K231, K235), which contained a BirA variant that was different from BirA-6xHis and the BirA variant isolated from the TagRFP (K10) displaying clones (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>). To further characterize the isolated clones, 10 clones were randomly selected and their ability to biotinylate TagRFP was tested by co-transforming them with a plasmid encoding TagRFP fused to the C-terminal of maltose binding protein (MBP). In 8 of the 10 clones, MBP-TagRFP and BirA-TagRFP co-expression biotinylated a protein migrating with a band size of ~75&#x02009;kDa, consistent with the expected molecular weight of MBP-TagRFP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). In clone 3 and 7, the biotinylated band at ~75&#x02009;kDa was not detectable; however, a faint band at the expected molecular weight of eCPX (~22&#x02009;kDa) was observed. By DNA sequencing in the reverse direction, we obtained the DNA sequence of the second half of the BirA gene of Clone 1, 4 and 8: The clones were different from the full-length BirA variant of the single TagRFP (K231, K235) clone and BirA-6xHis, Clone 4 was unique and Clone 1 and 8 were identical (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>). Clone 1 was used to test the specificity of the TagRFP biotinylation. Lysates from cell expression BirA-6xHis or BirA:TagRFP Clone 1 were mixed with MBP-TagRFP or MBP-TagRFP with K231A, K235A and K231A, K235A mutations. MBP was readily detected in all the tested combinations of lysates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Expression of BirA-6xHis caused a strong biotinylation of eCPX-AP, but no biotinylation product was detected at the expected size of MBP-TagRFP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). In contrast, biotinylated bands at 75&#x02009;kDa were detected after incubation of MBP-TagRFP and MBP-TagRFPK235 lysates with Clone 1, and the intensity of this band was strongly reduced by mutations of K231A and K231A,235&#x02009;A in TagRFP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Similar to the clones isolated from bacteria expressing peptides from Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase &#x003b1;1 subunit, as well as the &#x003b1;ENaC, &#x003b2;ENaC and &#x003b3;ENaC subunits, the intensity of the 75&#x02009;kDa bands were low compared to the intensity of the eCPX-AP band from the BirA-6xHis expressing bacteria. The results, however, indicate that BirA selected with the bacterial display system allows for biotinylation of a specific protein in complex mixtures.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Biotinylation of TagRFP.

The bacterial display system, thus, provides a basis for directed evolution of BirA variants with activity targeted towards specific target proteins. Almost all human and mouse proteins contain lysines and novel BirA variants could provide an attractive means for site-specific protein biotinylation in complex mixtures and thereby provide a high affinity tag for downstream purification or imaging of specific proteins of interest.</p><p id="Par12">The bacterial selection system effectively isolated BirA-6xHis activity against the synthetic AP diluted 10<sup>6</sup>-fold in cultures of bacteria displaying a mutated AP. The enrichment is orders of magnitude higher than previously reported for the phage display systems using monomeric avidin selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, indicating that the higher affinity of streptavidin increase the stringency of the selection process. Streptavidin selection of phages displaying biotinylated peptides has been used to identify novel peptide substrates for yeast biotin protein ligase, and yielded an estimated enrichment factor of ~2000<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The streptavidin-bound phages were eluted by incubation at high temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, indicating that the strong biotin-streptavidin binding combined with the multivalency of the displayed peptide (~5 peptides are displayed per phage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>) ensure isolation of rare active variants, but the high avidity still poses a problem in that incomplete elution of the isolated phages could hamper enrichment. The bacterial display system may, thus, have an advantage in that the elution can be eliminated and therefore allowed us to combine high affinity selection with amplification.</p><p id="Par13">The bacterial display system allowed for the isolation of clones with novel peptide substrate specificity. Compared to the BirA biotinylation of the synthetic AP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, however, our isolated clones showed relatively low activity towards the displayed peptide sequences and further rounds of mutation and selection could be used to evolve highly active clones. For directed evolution of our isolated BirA variants, it will be important to select for biotinylation rate by increasing selection pressure through e.g. lowered expression of BirA and shorter reaction time, or by fluorescent activated cell sorting of bacteria based on surface biotinylation. In addition to reaction rate, the target specificity of the selected BirA variants are important. We observed that some clones isolated from the display of peptides from Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase &#x003b1;1 subunit and &#x003b3;ENaC (K27) biotinylated additional bands. Promiscuous BirA activity is, however, readily detected by western blotting and the specific and promiscuous BirA variants could be used as precursors for novel BirA variants, which through e.g. DNA shuffling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> could be used to evolve BirA variants that biotinylates native proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> in e.g. mammalian cells.</p><p id="Par14">In addition to its use as an affinity tag, site-specific biotinylation could potentially be used as organelle-specific <italic>in vivo</italic> inhibitors of post-translational modifications.

We therefore used target peptide sequences surrounding the cleavage site and isolated BirA variants against lysine 184, 186 and 190. The BirA variants could serve as precursors for development of highly activate variants that could be targeted to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and endosomes and establish in which compartment the activation occurs. Thus, the expression of the BirA variants in specific cellular organelles could provide novel spatially restricted inhibitors of post-translational modifications, such as proteolytic cleavage and ubiquitination. The selection system is not limited to BirA and could potentially be used to select for other enzymes that carries out post-translational modification, such as kinases and ubiquitinases, and allow for development of novel tools to dissect signaling pathways.</p><p id="Par15">In summary, BirA variants with novel peptide substrate specificity are readily isolated using the bacterial display system.
