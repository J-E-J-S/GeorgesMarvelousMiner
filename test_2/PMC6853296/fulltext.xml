Those cP-containing RNAs (cP-RNAs) form a hidden layer of transcriptome because standard RNA-seq cannot capture them as a result of cP&#x02019;s prevention of an adapter ligation reaction. Here we provide genome-wide analyses of short cP-RNA transcriptome across multiple mouse tissues. Using cP-RNA-seq that can exclusively sequence cP-RNAs, we identified numerous novel cP-RNA species which are mainly derived from cytoplasmic tRNAs, mRNAs, and rRNAs. Determination of the processing sites of substrate RNAs for cP-RNA generation revealed highly-specific RNA cleavage events between cytidine and adenosine in cP-RNA biogenesis. cP-RNAs were not evenly derived from the overall region of substrate RNAs but rather from specific sites, implying that cP-RNAs are not from random degradation but are produced through a regulated biogenesis pathway. The identified cP-RNAs were abundantly accumulated in mouse tissues, and the expression levels of cP-RNAs showed age-dependent reduction. These analyses of cP-RNA transcriptome unravel a novel, abundant class of non-coding RNAs whose expression could have physiological roles.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>With the advent and evolution of next-generation sequencing technology, efforts to identify and catalog the expressed RNA molecules have greatly advanced our understanding of RNA biology.

With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, efforts to identify the expressed RNA molecules have greatly advanced our understanding of RNA biology [<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although NGS-based RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) has become a ubiquitous tool in biological and medical research [<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], the current standard RNA-seq methods, particularly those targeting short non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), do not fully capture all of the RNAs expressed but allow for some &#x0201c;escapers&#x0201d; to slip by undetected. The RNAs containing a 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphate (cP) at their 3&#x02032;-end are one such escaper that are not ligated to a 3&#x02032;-adapter during cDNA amplification procedure and thus uncaptured by standard RNA-seq. A cP end of RNA molecules, consisting of the phosphate linkage between the 2&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-positions of ribose, is mainly produced from RNA cleavage catalyzed by many endoribonucleases [<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. cP-containing RNAs (cP-RNAs) are not just accumulated as non-functional degradation products but have physiological roles in various biological processes. For example, Angiogenin (ANG), an RNase A-superfamily endoribonuclease, cleaves the anticodon-loop of tRNAs upon stress stimuli to produce functional tRNA halves known as tRNA-derived stress-induced RNAs (tiRNAs) [<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The 5&#x02032;-tiRNAs, corresponding to the 5&#x02032;-tRNA halves, contain a cP at their 3&#x02032;-end and promote the formation of stress granules, regulate translation, and trigger the cellular stress responses and apoptosis in neurodevelopmental disorders [<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In breast and prostate cancer cells, sex hormone signaling pathways promote ANG-catalyzed tRNA cleavages, generating a distinct class of tRNA halves, the sex hormone-dependent tRNA derived RNAs (SHOT-RNAs) [<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. cP-containing 5&#x02032;-SHOT-RNAs (5&#x02032;-tRNA halves) have a functional significance in cell proliferation [<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Given that cP-RNAs are expressed as functional molecules, capturing the entire repertoire of cP-RNAs would broaden the catalog of functional ncRNAs and reveal significant biological events that have been eluding standard RNA-seq. We recently developed &#x0201c;cP-RNA-seq,&#x0201d; which is able to specifically sequence cP-RNAs [<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and applied the method to a short RNA fraction of BT-474 breast cancer cells to identify 5&#x02032;-SHOT-RNAs [<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Because the previous work narrowly focused on 5&#x02032;-SHOT-RNAs in only one cell line, cP-RNAs still largely remained a hidden component in the transcriptome. In this report, we expanded populations of RNA subjects and identified a comprehensive repertoire of short cP-RNAs in four different mouse tissues. A genome-wide in-depth view of cP-RNA transcriptome revealed that not only tRNAs but also other RNA species are widely, but specifically, cleaved between cytidine and adenosine for constitutive expression of diverse species of cP-RNAs. We further discovered age-dependent changes in the expression levels of cP-RNAs, implying the involvement of cP-RNA production in the aging process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec002"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="sec003"><title>cP-containing tRNA halves are abundantly and constitutively expressed in mouse tissues</title><p>Because ANG-generated 5&#x02032;-tRNA halves contain a cP, exploration of the accumulation of cP-RNAs in mouse tissues began with analyses of tRNA halves.

Although the levels of mature tRNAs were comparable across all the examined tissues, tRNA halves showed differential expression patterns among the tissues, implying a regulated biogenesis of tRNA halves. The abundant accumulation of 5&#x02032;-tRNA halves found in the spleen and less abundant accumulations in other tissues, such as the brain, heart, liver, and testis, are consistent with previous reports [<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

T4 PNK treatment also shifted the band up, and further up-shift was observed by the acid plus CIP treatments, indicating the additional presence of a cP in the 5&#x02032;-tRNA half.

Total RNAs from lung of 2- and 84-week old mice were subjected to cP-RNA-seq and mRNA-seq for identification of mRNA-derived cP-RNAs and their substrate mRNAs, respectively. Consistent with the downregulated expression of cP-RNAs in older mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008469.g005">Fig 5A&#x02013;5C</xref></bold>), cP-RNA-seq amplified less abundant cDNAs from the 84-week old mice compared to the 2-week old mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008469.g005">Fig 5D</xref></bold>). Illumina sequencing of the cDNAs yielded ~23&#x02013;29 million raw reads, of which ~3&#x02013;6.5 million reads were extracted as the reads of mRNA-derived cP-RNAs (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008469.s016">S5 Table</xref></bold>). After normalization based on the read number information of a spike-in cP-RNA, fold changes of cP-RNA read numbers of 84 week samples, with respect to those of 2 week samples, were compared with fold changes of mRNA-seq read numbers for each mRNA in a scatter plot (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008469.g005">Fig 5E</xref></bold>). Strong aggregations of the spots appeared at the point where the levels of cP-RNAs were 4-fold reduced in 84-week samples compared to 2-week samples without changes in the levels of their substrate mRNAs. Consistent with the results of TaqMan RT-qPCR (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008469.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref></bold>), reduction of cPR-Ncbp3 was confirmed in the scatter plot (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008469.g005">Fig 5E</xref></bold>). As representative results, normalized alignment patterns of cP-RNAs in the three selected mRNAs, Ncbp3, Cd93, and Tsc22d1, are shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008469.g005">Fig 5F</xref></bold>. Specific productions of cP-RNAs through cleavage between C and A residues and their reduction in 84-week samples were observed. Together with the decreased C and A nucleotide biases in 84-week samples (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008469.s010">S10 Fig</xref></bold>), these results suggest that the expression of cP-RNAs is decreased through aging, which is independent of the levels of substrate RNAs but is caused by reduced C-A cleavage activity for cP-RNA productions or by reduced stability of cP-RNAs.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we unraveled a previously hidden layer of transcriptome by comprehensively identifying short cP-RNA species expressed in mouse tissues. Each cP-RNA library, obtained by cP-RNA-seq, commonly comprised previously uninterrogated cP-RNA species that are expected to be generated by specific RNA cleavage between cytidine and adenosine (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008469.s011">S11 Fig</xref></bold>). The endoribonuclease generating the identified cP-RNAs is unknown but should possess highly specific recognition and cleavage activity for the 5&#x02032;-CA-3&#x02032; sequence. ANG might be the candidate enzyme because ANG produces cP-RNAs [<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and shows the highest activity toward the 5&#x02032;-CA-3&#x02032; among four examined dinucleotides in a previous study [<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Among other cP-generating ribonucleases, GCN4 shows high cleavage activity between C and A [<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Because cP-RNAs are not evenly produced from overall sequences of substrate RNAs but rather derived from specific sites, the RNA cleavage activity to generate cP-RNAs might be exquisitely regulated. Further investigations are required to clarify the enzyme and its activity for the generation of the cP-RNAs identified in this study. Considering the already-proven functional significance of tRNA-derived cP-RNAs [<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008469.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], it is not surprising that the identified cP-RNAs themselves have functional significance. Their abundance and expression from only specific sites of substrate RNAs might also imply their expression as functional molecules. The reduction of cP-RNA generation through aging implied its physiological relevance. It will be intriguing to examine further the cellular factors that influence, or are influenced by, the expression of cP-RNAs and their underlying molecular mechanisms, which will define cP-RNAs as an abundant class of functional non-coding RNAs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All mouse experiments were conducted in compliance with the standards and guidelines of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Thomas Jefferson University.
