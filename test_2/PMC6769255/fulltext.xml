There are two orders of magnitude more predicted enhancers in the human genome than gene promoters (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al, 2015</xref>), indicating that many mammalian genes are regulated by multiple enhancers. Analysis of 3D genome architecture (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>) and the expression of enhancer RNAs (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Andersson et al, 2014</xref>) corroborate the idea that the average human gene is regulated by the combined action of many enhancers. Functional studies into enhancer combinations have found that enhancers can work together in an additive/independent (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Fujioka et al, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bender et al, 2012</xref>), synergistic (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Lam et al, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Torbey et al, 2018</xref>), or redundant (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hong et al, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Osterwalder et al, 2018</xref>) manner, indicating that enhancers can combine to regulate gene expression in complex and diverse ways.</p><p>There are two different approaches to functionally perturb enhancers to study enhancer function: tests of necessity and tests of sufficiency. Deleting or inhibiting enhancer function tests the necessity of an enhancer for endogenous gene expression. The sufficiency of enhancer sequences can be studied by ectopic reporter assays (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Catarino &#x00026; Stark, 2018</xref>). However, testing only enhancer sequences does not uncover how enhancers act in their endogenous environment. To determine whether an enhancer region is sufficient within the genomic context, enhancers must be directly activated in an unbiased way. Most studies of enhancer function and combinatorics involve genetic deletion of the region(s) of interest. Genetic deletion, along with CRISPR interference-based approaches (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gilbert et al, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Thakore et al, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Fulco et al, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Korkmaz et al, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Carleton et al, 2017</xref>), test the necessity of a genomic region or combination of genomic regions for regulatory activity. Regulatory element screens that test sufficiency have identified shared and unique regulatory elements in comparison with screens for necessity, indicating that necessity and sufficiency are complementary assays (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Klann et al, 2017</xref>). Testing the sufficiency of an enhancer by direct activation provides additional insight into the innate capabilities of an enhancer, the requirements of enhancer function, and whether genomic properties at enhancer regions associate with an enhancer&#x02019;s potential for modulating transcription. However, testing the sufficiency of genomic regulatory regions in their native context is less commonly undertaken than necessity.</p><p>Reporter assays, in which a plasmid containing a potential enhancer sequence controls the expression of a reporter gene, are one way of testing enhancer sufficiency (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Catarino &#x00026; Stark, 2018</xref>). However, this technique does not analyze an enhancer within its native chromatin context and is likely missing information that might be critical for the ability of an enhancer to regulate gene expression, such as epigenetic marks, interaction of enhancers with specific promoters, and properties of adjacent genomic regions (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cunningham et al, 2018</xref>). CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) is a recently developed tool for activating gene expression from specific regions of the genome. CRISPRa involves the fusion of a catalytically dead Cas9 protein (dCas9) to an activation domain. Different activation domains can be fused to dCas9, including the transcriptional activation domain of VP16 (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al, 2013</xref>) and the enzymatic core domain of p300 (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hilton et al, 2015</xref>). VP16 is a herpes simplex virus transcription factor (TF) which recruits a variety of host factors, including general TFs, mediator, and histone acetyltransferases (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Hirai et al, 2010</xref>). p300 is a histone acetyltransferase linked with activation of many genomic regions (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Delvecchio et al, 2013</xref>). CRISPRa provides a strategy for turning on specific genes when targeted to promoter regions with gRNAs (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Perez-Pinera et al, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chavez et al, 2015</xref>). CRISPRa can also be targeted to distal regulatory regions to test their sufficiency in promoting gene expression (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hilton et al, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Klann et al, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Thormann et al, 2018</xref>); however, very few distal regulatory regions have been interrogated in this manner, and it is unclear how targeting CRISPRa to combinations of enhancers will impact gene expression.</p><p>Many enhancers are controlled by the activity of inducible TFs. Estrogen receptor &#x0237a; (ER) is a steroid hormone receptor which only has gene regulatory activity when it is bound by estrogens. ER acts mostly as an activating TF, binding to thousands of genomic loci and regulating hundreds of genes (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Gertz et al, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Most genes that are up-regulated by estrogen have multiple ER-bound sites nearby and we have previously found evidence of collaboration between ER-bound sites in regulating the gene expression response to estrogens (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Carleton et al, 2017</xref>). Using a CRISPRi-based approach, enhancer interference (Enhancer-i), we found synergistic and hierarchical relationships involving ER-bound sites. These relationships were discovered by measuring the necessity of each ER-bound site individually and in combination. It is unclear whether estrogen receptor&#x02013;binding site (ERBS) collaboration is a property of ER or dependent on the genomic properties of ERBSs, necessitating an investigation of ERBS sufficiency in the genomic context.</p><p>Here, we use CRISPRa to target combinations of regulatory regions that are normally bound by ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>). By targeting these regions in the absence of estrogens, we sought to determine if CRISPRa synthetic activators could recreate the transcriptional response to estrogens. We find that dCas9-VP16(10x) fusion can recreate most of the estrogen response at the four genes tested, although dCas9-p300(core) was not as effective. Targeting CRISPRa to individual regulatory regions and combinations of loci uncovered an additive/independent relationship between sites, in contrast to our previous necessity findings. Our results indicate that ER binding to neighboring enhancers works in a synergistic fashion, but synthetic activators directly recruited to loci normally bound by ER work independently to regulate gene expression.</p><fig fig-type="featured" id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Targeting multiple ERBSs with synthetic activators can activate gene expression.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Cartoon depicting the targeting of multiple ERBSs in combination to study combinatorial effects on gene expression. <bold>(B)</bold> Relative locations of ERBSs (blue), ERBS-adjacent regions (red), and genes (green) tested in this study. <bold>(C&#x02013;F)</bold> Targeting all 12 ERBSs in combination with dCas9-vp16(10x) (red) or dCas9-p300(core) (green) activated gene expression at <italic>MMP17</italic> (C), <italic>CISH</italic> (D), <italic>FHL2</italic> (E), and <italic>HES2</italic> (F) to levels that are comparable with an 8-h E2 treatment (light gray).

We chose a set of 12 ERBSs that were within 125 kb of four genes that are normally responsive to estrogen. <italic>MMP17</italic> has two upstream and one downstream ERBSs, <italic>CISH</italic> has three downstream ERBSs, and <italic>FHL2</italic> and <italic>HES2</italic> both have three upstream ERBSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>). We targeted the CRISPRa fusions to the 12 ERBSs simultaneously and measured gene expression of the target genes in the absence of estrogens and, therefore, the absence of ER binding. We observed significant gene expression activation by dCas9-VP16(10x) at all four genes tested, whereas activation by dCas9-p300(core) was significant at three genes (<italic>MMP17</italic>, <italic>CISH</italic>, and <italic>HES2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C&#x02013;F</xref>). For comparison, we also targeted our constructs to the promoter regions of these four genes and found that targeting ERBSs often results in equal or greater activation than targeting the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C&#x02013;F</xref>). dCas9-VP16(10x) was consistently a stronger activator than dCas9-p300(core). The level of gene expression driven by dCas9-VP16(10x) was somewhat correlated with the fold change in gene expression seen with a 17&#x003b2;-estradiol (E2) induction at this set of four genes (r = 0.8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig S1C</xref>). These results demonstrate that CRISPRa targeted to ERBSs can mimic the activation seen in an E2 transcriptional response.</p><p>To determine if the activation potential is specific to ERBSs, we targeted dCas9-VP16(10x) and dCas9-p300(core) to a total of six regions surrounding <italic>MMP17</italic>, <italic>CISH</italic>, and <italic>FHL2</italic> that are at most 8 kb away from ERBSs discussed above (or the transcriptional start site [TSS] in the case of FHL2-B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>). Regions with low DNase I hypersensitivity signal (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gertz et al, 2013</xref>) were chosen, to limit the probability that the locus was an active regulatory region controlled by other TFs. As <italic>HES2</italic> is in a highly active region with several DNase I hypersensitive sites and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation positive loci, multiple nearby genes, and many TF-binding events, we were unable to choose sites that were not potential regulatory regions at this locus. In choosing adjacent regions, we aimed to keep the distance to the TSS similar without being too close to the ER-bound site. We observed some TFs binding to the chosen adjacent regions, notably at CISH-A (Table S3). When targeting the ERBS-adjacent sites, we did not observe significant activation over the control of targeting the <italic>IL1RN</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C&#x02013;E</xref>). The inability of ERBS-adjacent regions to regulate gene expression when bound by synthetic activators indicates specificity when testing sufficiency of regulatory regions with CRISPRa and differences in activation potential between ERBSs and nearby non-ERBSs.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>dCas9 activator fusions can target precise genomic loci and induce histone acetylation</title><p>To test whether CRISPRa is successfully targeted to the intended genomic regions surrounding our genes of interest, we conducted a chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiment using an antibody that recognizes an HA epitope tag on dCas9. dCas9-VP16(10x) was targeted to 19 loci, consisting of 12 ERBSs, 6 ERBS-adjacent regions, and the <italic>IL1RN</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>).

We, therefore, performed ChIP-seq with an antibody that recognizes H3K27ac to determine if the CRISPRa fusions were able to cause H3K27ac at targeted sites. For 18 of 19 targeted loci, we observed increased H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs 2C and D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2C&#x02013;G</xref>). Notably, at HES2-1 and HES2-3, there is significant baseline H3K27ac present, possibly because of the binding of other TFs to these sites (Table S2). For ERBSs, the patterns of acetylation are similar to E2-induced H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs 2E and F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2D and E</xref>).

This result is in contrast to the greater gene activation induced by dCas9-VP16(10x), indicating that histone acetylation of a distal regulatory element is not fully predictive of target gene activation. Consistent with the idea that H3K27ac by itself is not sufficient to drive maximal expression, we observed H3K27ac at the adjacent regions even though they were unable to induce gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig S2F</xref>). In addition, we conducted ChIP-seq with an antibody for RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) and found limited RNAPII recruitment to ERBSs by dCas9-p300(core) or dCas9-VP16(10x) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig S2H</xref>), although we saw RNAPII recruitment by dCas9-VP16(10x) at the <italic>IL1RN</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig S2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>dCas9-VP16(10x) activates gene expression from individual ERBSs</title><p>Because targeting dCas9-VP16(10x) to all ERBSs simultaneously resulted in gene activation of all genes, we next sought to determine if targeting individual ERBSs with dCas9-VP16(10x) is sufficient to increase gene expression.

To describe the differences in gene expression seen from our combinatorial activation studies, we fit relative energy parameters to an abstracted model of combinatorial synthetic activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>). The model included four sets of interactions: (1) interactions between dCas9-VP16(10x) and targeted ERBSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>, red), (2) interactions between ERBS-bound synthetic activators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>, green), (3) interactions between ERBS-bound synthetic activators and RNAPII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>, blue), and (4) interactions between RNAPII and a gene&#x02019;s promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>, purple). This model assumes that the probability of RNAPII binding is proportional to a gene&#x02019;s expression. We used the correlation between the probability of RNAPII being bound and gene expression data from targeting combinations of ERBSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref>) to fit model parameters. We ran the parameter optimization with many random starts, then selected parameters that fit gene expression levels reasonably well (within 0.1 of optimal) (see the Materials and Methods section). We consequently observed a range of parameters that were locally optimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B&#x02013;E</xref>). In some cases, we observed multimodal parameter distributions, which is likely due to parameters balancing each other in different ways, leading to multiple local optima.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Thermodynamic modeling reveals little cooperativity between synthetic activator-bound ERBSs.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Schematic showing the set of modeled parameters. <bold>(B&#x02013;E)</bold> Parameters were fit to gene expression data for <italic>MMP17</italic>, <italic>CISH</italic>, <italic>FHL2</italic>, and <italic>HES2</italic> (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref>).

For example, at <italic>FHL2</italic>, site FHL2-1 has the largest impact on expression and the most favorable interaction with RNAPII, whereas FHL2-2 and FHL2-3 have modest effects on expression and slightly favorable RNAPII-synthetic activator interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4D</xref>). In these models, the interaction between synthetic activators and RNAPII can be balanced by differential recruitment of the synthetic activators to the ERBSs (shown in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>). For example, CISH-1 and CISH-2 both activate gene expression to similar levels, but CISH-1 is modeled with the synthetic activator more strongly recruiting RNAPII, whereas CISH-2 is modeled as binding the synthetic activator with more efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4C</xref>). The relationship between ERBSs in the sufficiency experiments is best captured by the interaction terms between synthetic activators bound to ERBSs (parameter ranges shown in green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>). For all studied genes, we do not see strong cooperativity between ERBSs. For <italic>MMP17</italic> and <italic>CISH</italic>, we observed relatively neutral interactions between ERBSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B and C</xref>). The best fits for <italic>FHL2</italic> and <italic>HES2</italic> were mostly competitive models where certain ERBSs inhibit others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4D and E</xref>). This may result from a limit in how much gene activation can be driven by the synthetic activators. For example, dCas9-VP16(10x) at HES2-1 results in a similar gene expression level as targeting all ERBSs surrounding <italic>HES2</italic> simultaneously. Even though targeting of HES2-2 or HES2-3 has some activity in isolation, they are unable to increase expression beyond HES2-1 targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3D</xref>). This is captured in the model as unfavorable interactions between HES2-1 and the other ERBSs. In general, the lack of cooperativity in these models supports the conclusion that these sites work independently to activate gene expression when targeted with dCas9-VP16(10x).</p><p>It is possible that the observed independence of synthetically activated ERBSs is due to the strength of dCas9-VP16(10x), which may override the subtleties of enhancer synergy.

The presence of multiple local optima might be due to low levels of activation and lower signal-to-noise ratios.

We previously reported synergy between ERBSs when testing necessity.

In contrast to the models based on CRISPRa, we observed the expected cooperative interactions between pairs of ERBSs: MMP17-1 and MMP17-2, CISH-1 and CISH-2, and FHL2-1 and FHL2-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig S5A&#x02013;C</xref>).

These results are consistent with synergy in gene regulation occurring between ERBSs when ER is binding to the enhancers, whereas ERBSs that are instead bound by synthetic activators act independently on gene expression. Therefore, synergy likely occurs in the recruitment of ER and potentially cofactors to an ERBS, whereas targeting an activator directly to an ERBS does not require synergy with neighboring ERBSs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s8"><title>Discussion</title><p>CRISPR-based gene activation is a unique platform for interrogating the sufficiency of gene expression enhancers within the native genomic context. In this study, we applied variations of the approach to distal regulatory elements normally bound by ER, using cells that were not exposed to estrogens and therefore had negligible ER activity. Targeting dCas9, fused to either the enzymatic core of p300 or 10 copies of VP16, to 12 ERBSs surrounding four genes simultaneously activated transcription to levels that mimicked an E2 transcriptional response. We also observed H3K27ac deposition at all sites targeted, in a pattern similar to that caused by E2 treatment. Regions adjacent to ERBSs do not activate gene expression when targeted, suggesting that certain loci have the potential to impact gene expression when locally activated and others do not.</p><p>In agreement with the idea of inherent activation potential of an enhancer, we also found that the sufficiency of an ERBS, as measured by dCas9-VP16(10x) gene activation from the site, is correlated with the necessity of the site, as measured by SID(4x)-dCas9-KRAB interference (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Carleton et al, 2017</xref>). This observation supports the notion that inducible enhancers have an intrinsic ability to activate gene expression to a certain magnitude. Analysis of potential genomic factors that may determine activation potential revealed that the best predictor of dCas9-VP16(10x) activation is the number of other TFs present at the site. A battery of other TFs may help stabilize dCas9-VP16(10x) or may perform orthogonal roles in enhancer maturation. This finding indicates that the underlying DNA sequence may be important for regulation by synthetic activators as they may be working together with other TFs. For dCas9-p300(core), the most important predictor is the base amount of RNAPII already present at the site, which could point to an important difference between the synthetic activators in their ability to recruit RNAPII, as VP16 has been shown to recruit basal TFs (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Hirai et al, 2010</xref>). The unique predictors from this analysis suggest that different modes of activation are used by dCas9-VP16(10x) and dCas9-p300(core), which warrants further study.</p><p>We tested two dCas9 fusions and found that dCas9-VP16(10x) activates genes to a higher level than dCas9-p300(core). The fusions caused similar levels of H3K27ac to be deposited at targeted loci, suggesting that histone acetylation is not the only event that impacts transcription and that VP16 is likely contributing to gene activation in other ways. This could be because VP16 recruits a host of cofactors, including basal TFs and mediator, in addition to histone acetyltransferases (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Hirai et al, 2010</xref>). These interactions allow VP16 to more directly assemble the transcriptional machinery, whereas p300-induced acetylation may be limited by other methods of transcriptional control, such as protein recruitment. The superior performance of dCas9-VP16(10x) may also be specific to the ERBS that we targeted, as dCas9-p300(core) has been shown to be more effective than VP16(4x) at other loci (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hilton et al, 2015</xref>), or it could be explained by the extra copies of VP16 in the 10x fusion.</p><p>Although the necessity and sufficiency of individual ERBSs were well correlated, the manner in which they combine to regulate gene expression was very different when tested with Enhancer-i and CRISPRa. In necessity experiments, pairs of ERBSs showed synergistic behavior. For example, <italic>CISH</italic> was not estrogen responsive unless both CISH-1 and CISH-2 were active. In the sufficiency experiments, ERBSs combined in a mostly independent/additive fashion, although some combinations appear sub-additive and may approach a saturating level of activation for the gene. One explanation for the independence between enhancers when bound by synthetic activators is that the synthetic activators are so strong that they override more subtle regulatory events that require synergy. However, we do not believe this to be the case because an E2 induction leads to higher expression levels than either activator, especially dCas9-p300(core). The contrast in how ERBSs combine to regulate transcription in the two experimental approaches suggests that the synergy between ERBSs likely occurs in <italic>cis</italic>, where the recruitment of ER and its cofactors, such as histone acetyltransferases (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hanstein et al, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Shang et al, 2000</xref>), is synergistic between ERBSs. However, if the cofactors are directly recruited to the ERBSs, as is the case with CRISPRa, then synergy no longer occurs. In this model, synergy occurs when ERBSs influence one another before activation. Then, once ERBSs are activated through the binding of TFs and cofactors, ERBSs communicate with the target gene independently. There are important caveats to consider when using these synthetic activators, including the possible recruitment of cofactors that do not normally bind to a particular enhancer or potential interference with TF binding by dCas9.
