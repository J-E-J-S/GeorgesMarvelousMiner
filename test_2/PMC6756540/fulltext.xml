Several different methods including fluorescence marker-assisted visual screen of transgene-free mutants and programmed self-elimination of CRISPR/Cas9 construct have been used to increase the efficiency of genome edited transgene-free mutant isolation, but the overall time length required to obtain transgene-free mutants has remained unchanged in these methods. We report here a method for fast generation and easy identification of transgene-free mutants in Arabidopsis. By generating and using a single <italic>FT</italic> expression cassette-containing CRISPR/Cas9 construct, we targeted two sites of the <italic>AITR1</italic> gene. We obtained many early bolting plants in T1 generation, and found that about two thirds of these plants have detectable mutations. We then analyzed T2 generations of two representative lines of genome edited early bolting T1 plants, and identified plants without early bolting phenotype, i.e., transgene-free plants, for both lines. Further more, <italic>aitr1</italic> homozygous mutants were successful obtained for both lines from these transgene-free plants. Taken together, these results suggest that the method described here enables fast generation, and at the mean time, easy identification of transgene-free mutants in plants.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>National Key R&#x00026;D Program of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>2016YFD0101902</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Key R&#x00026;D Program of China (2016YFD0101902).

Since then, the CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing techniques including the double-stranded DNA cleaving based editing and the nucleotide substitution based editing have been widely used to generate mutations in different plant species, in some cases, to improve agronomic traits such as yield, quality and biotic and abiotic stress tolerances [<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thanks to their high efficiency in genome editing and the use of engineered Cas9 variants with expanded target space, CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing systems have brought a bright future for plant breeding [<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The presence of Cas9 T-DNA in CRISPR/Cas9 genome-edited mutants may affect the phenotypic stability and heritability of the mutation, and transgene-free is likely required for commercial application of CRISPR/Cas9 genome-edited crops [<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218583.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, isolation of transgene-free mutants is one of the most important steps for generation mutants by using CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing. However, isolation of transgene-free mutants by using the traditional genetic segregation and backcross based genotyping is time consuming and laborious [<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. To improve the efficiency in transgene-free mutant isolation from CRISPR/Cas9 genome edited plants, a few different methods have been established [<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These methods include the fluorescence maker-assisted selection, which allows to isolate transgene-free mutants based on the observation of the absence of fluorescence in seeds produced by transgenic plants [<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; the active interference element mediated selection, which allows herbicide-dependent isolation of transgene-free plants [<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; and the programmed self-elimination system, which allows only transgene-free male gametophytes to produce seeds [<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. All these methods greatly reduced workload for transgene-free mutant isolation. However, the overall time length required for the whole process of mutant generation, from plant transformation, to mutant identification, and then transgene-free mutant isolation remained largely unchanged.</p><p>Appropriate flowering time is critical for successful sexual reproduction in flowering plants [<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In order to achieve sexual reproduction successful, flowering plants need to sense and respond to environmental stimuli appropriately, and then integrate the environmental information with endogenous signals to make transit from vegetative growth to flowering [<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Accumulated evidence suggest that flowering time in Arabidopsis is controlled by several different regulators, including CO (CONSTANS), SOC1 (SUPRESSOR OF CONSTANS OVEREXPRESSION1), FLM (FLOWERING LOCUS M), FLC, FLK (FLOWERING LOOCUS K HOMOLOGY (KH) DOMAIN), VRN2 (VERNALIZATION 2), MAF2 (MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING 2) and FT (FLOWERING LOCUS T) [<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Among them, FLC and CO are major regulators involved in vernalization and photoperiod, the two most important environmental stimuli that control the switch from vegetative growth to flowering, respectively, and functioned immediately upstream of FT to regulate the switch [<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>FT is the key positive regulator of flowering in Arabidopsis, and at least some of the FT homologues in other plant species including medicago, rice, soybean and trees like poplar and pear also function as an activator of flowering [<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Due to its important role in flowering promotion, FT has been successfully used to reducing juvenile phase of many plants, therefore accelerated the process for plant breeding [<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Considering that early flowering phenotype caused by overexpression of <italic>FT</italic> in plants is easy to observe, and the resulted short life cycle will accelerate mutant generation, integration of a FT expression cassette into CRISPR/Cas9 may enable fast generation and easy identification of transgene-free mutants in plants.

Consider that mutants can be obtained from early bolting T1 plants based on PCR results only or combined with sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218583.g002">Fig 2</xref>), and transgene-free plants can be easily obtained from offsprings of the early bolting T1 plants based solely on bolting phenotype segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218583.g005">Fig 5</xref>), only T1 plants with early bolting phenotypes should be selected for next step analysis when using this method to generate for genome edited transgene-free mutants.</p><p>In addition to enabling easy identification of transgene-free mutants based on phenotypic observation, the early bolting phenotype also reduce the length of the juvenile phase, which led to reduced overall time length required for generating genome edited transgene-free mutants. In our case, the different bolting time between early bolting transgenic plants and Col wild type plants were more than 10 days even in soil grown T2 generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218583.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Because early bolting plants were selected in T1, but plants with normal bolting time were selected in T2, the overall time length required for generating genome edited transgene-free mutants in Arabidopsis will be reduced by at least 10 days. In some cases, transgene-free mutants may not be able to be identified in T2 generations, and had to be identified on T3 generations. In that case, identifying mutants from offsprings of the gene-edited early bolting T2 plants may save more time than from that of the transgene-free heterozygous T2 mutants. However, it should be considered that early flowering Arabidopsis plants are weak, thus need to be taken good care of in order to obtain seeds. It should also be noted that because overexpression of <italic>FT</italic> promoted flowering, CRISPR/Cas9 vector with <italic>FT</italic> expression cassette is not suitable for editing genes involved in the regulation of flowering time in plants.</p><p>In this study, the effects of integration of <italic>FT</italic> expression cassette into CRISPR/Cas9 vector to accelerate transgene-free mutant isolation was tasted only in Arabidopsis, however, considering that the juvenile phase for most crops such as rice and soybean lasts for months, and that for most of the trees including fruit trees such as apple and pear lasts for years, whereas overexpression of <italic>FT</italic> greatly reduced the length of juvenile phase in most of the plants examined, including all the plants such as the model plants Arabidopsis, crops including rice and soybean, and fruit trees such as apple and pear [<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0218583.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], the method described here may benefit even more for genome editing based breeding for the plants with a long juvenile phase.</p><p>On the other hand, transgenic plants of different plant species may need to be selected in different antibiotics, and multiple genes may need to be edited simultaneously, by replacing the antibiotic gene and/or the <italic>sgRNA</italic> clone cassette, the <italic>pHEE-FT</italic> vector reported here may be used for genome editing for a single or multiple genes in different plant species.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Miss Lily Wang (University Hill Secondary School) for language editing of this manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0218583.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Jinek</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Chylinski</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Fonfara</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hauer</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Doudna</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Charpentier</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>. <article-title>A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity</article-title>. <source>Science</source>
