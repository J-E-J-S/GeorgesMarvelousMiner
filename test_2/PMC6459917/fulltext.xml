Cohesin genes were originally identified in yeast as mutants that displayed premature separation of sister chromatids, and were later identified as being highly conserved from yeast to mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The cohesin subunits form a ring-shaped structure that encircles chromatin, which is loaded onto chromatin in early G1 phase of the cell cycle immediately following cytokinesis and concatenates sister chromatids during DNA replication in S phase. Cohesin remains chromatin bound specifically at centromeres in prophase of mitosis while the majority of cohesin along chromatid arms is released, and then the remainder of chromatin-bound cohesin is cleaved at the metaphase to anaphase transition to enable segregation of the sister chromatids into two daughter cells. Recent studies have found that cohesin containing the more abundant STAG2 subunit is essential for chromatid cohesion at centromeres and along chromosome arms, while cohesin containing the less abundant STAG1 subunit is essential for chromatid cohesion specifically at telomeres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In addition to its canonical role in sister chromatid cohesion, studies have indicated that cohesin is essential for a multitude of other cellular functions. Notably, cohesin was recently shown to be required for the formation of chromatin loops, such as those that bring together distant superenhancers with immediate upstream promoter sequences to regulate gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. While cohesin forms a ring-like structure that encircles chromatin, no DNA binding motifs with nucleotide sequence specificity have been identified within the core cohesin subunits. However, emerging studies have shown that cohesin is enriched at specific chromatin loci including active transcriptional sites and pericentric heterochromatin, suggesting cohesin localization is directed by specific DNA-binding regulatory proteins. The CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) has been identified as a direct binding partner of STAG2 that is dispensable for cohesin loading onto chromatin but is required for cohesin enrichment at specific enhancer regulatory loci throughout the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">While cohesin is known to be loaded onto chromatin immediately following cytokinesis at the completion of mitosis, it is during DNA replication in S-phase when this pool of cohesin concatenates sister chromatids to establish cohesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Recent studies have demonstrated that the MCM replicative helicase complex is critical for this cohesion establishment during S-phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, the extent to which cohesin is essential for DNA replication is largely unknown, as is the effect that cohesin gene mutations in human cancers might have on stability and procession of replication forks. Notably, recent studies in yeast have hypothesized a role for cohesin in replication fork dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Germline mutations in the cohesin subunits or in genes responsible for cohesin loading (e.g., <italic>NIPBL</italic>) or regulation (e.g., <italic>HDAC8</italic> and <italic>ESCO2</italic>) cause a spectrum of severe developmental syndromes characterized by facial dysmorphism, growth retardation, mental retardation, and limb anomalies. Depending on the gene affected, these have been termed Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Roberts syndrome, and other eponyms, which are now all considered to be &#x0201c;cohesinopathies&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Analysis of cells from affected patients found precocious separation of sister chromatids before anaphase in mitosis, which was hypothesized to be a causative mechanism in these syndromes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, subsequent studies have not observed similar defects in sister chromatid cohesion, calling into question the functional consequence of cohesin mutations in the germline of affected patients. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling in cells derived from Cornelia de Lange syndrome patients with <italic>NIPBL</italic> or <italic>SMC1A</italic> mutations versus normal subjects has revealed a conserved pattern of transcriptional dysregulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. As a result, these cohesinopathy syndromes are now widely regarded to result from deregulated gene expression during development.</p><p id="Par7">Recent genomic analyses of human cancer have identified that the cohesin genes, and <italic>STAG2</italic> in particular, are frequent targets of mutational inactivation in a select subset of tumor types that include glioblastoma, urothelial carcinoma, Ewing sarcoma, and myeloid leukemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. <italic>STAG2</italic> has been identified as one of only 12 genes that are significantly mutated in four or more human cancer types by The Cancer Genome Atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, in which <italic>STAG2</italic> mutation defines molecular subgroups of these tumor types with distinct clinical outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Initial studies in glioblastoma cell lines suggested a role for <italic>STAG2</italic> mutations as a cause of chromosomal instability and aneuploidy during tumorigenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, the majority of urothelial carcinomas, Ewing sarcomas, and myeloid leukemias harboring <italic>STAG2</italic> mutations are actually diploid or near-diploid tumors, suggesting that cohesin mutations in cancer likely promote tumorigenesis by mechanisms unrelated to chromosome segregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The exact reasons why inactivating cohesin mutations are selected for during cancer development and progression are still uncertain. In one recent study, <italic>STAG2</italic> mutations were found to be acquired after therapy with RAF inhibitors in <italic>BRAF</italic>-mutant melanomas as a mechanism of therapeutic resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. However, the majority of <italic>STAG2</italic> mutations in glioblastoma, urothelial carcinoma, and Ewing sarcoma are clonal events that likely arise early during tumor development. The therapeutic consequences of cohesin mutations in these cancers are largely unknown at present, as are methodologies for treating cohesin-mutant cancers using a precision medicine approach.</p><p id="Par8">Here we investigated the function of the cohesin subunit <italic>STAG2</italic> in primary non-transformed human cells to discern the basic cellular processes regulated by this gene that serves as a scaffold between the cohesin ring and the nuclear proteome.

Both shRNA sequences resulted in a sustained depletion of &#x0003e;99% of STAG2 protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Both shRNAs resulted in an accumulation of cells stalled within S-phase of the cell cycle apparent in all three cell lines as early as 48&#x02009;h after infection, with failure to enter G2/M over an extended time interval (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>).

We identified across a panel of multiple human cell lines that the cohesin ring physically associates with both the pre-replication complex and the replication machinery at the replication fork, but failed to identify an interaction with the origin recognition complex (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>). Next, we performed immunoprecipitation using antibodies against cohesin subunits and cohesin regulatory factors to determine the specificity of interaction with the replication helicase MCM3. We found that MCM3 specifically associates with STAG2, SMC3, SMC1A, and PDS5A, but not the cohesin regulatory factors NIPBL and Securin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, c</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b</xref>). In order to assess the cell cycle specificity of the interaction between cohesin and replication factors, immunoprecipitation was performed using SMC3 antibodies on RPE cells either asynchronously proliferating (+DMSO vehicle), arrested in G1 phase using the cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor palbociclib, arrested in S phase using the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin, or arrested in mitosis using the microtubule polymerization inhibitor colcemid. The interaction between cohesin and the replication factors was enriched during S-phase arrest, was absent during mitotic arrest, and was diminished during G1 arrest (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). In contrast, SMC3 interaction with Securin, a mitotic regulator of cohesin, was enriched during mitotic arrest and was diminished during G1 and S phase arrest.

STAG2 deficiency in primary non-transformed human cells induces an intra-S-phase arrest due to stalling of replication forks. We demonstrate across a spectrum of human cell lines that the cohesin ring physically associates with a multitude of key replication factors including the MCM helicase complex, replication licensing factors such as Geminin and CDT1, and the replisome machinery including PCNA and DNA polymerases. In the absence of STAG2, the cohesin ring is more robustly bound to the replication licensing inhibitor Geminin, the single-strand DNA binding protein RPA2/p34, and the MCM helicase complex. In contrast, the interaction of the cohesin ring with replisome components PCNA, PolD, and PolE is disrupted, whereas the interaction with other replisome components including CDC45 and AND1 remains stable. These findings indicate that the interaction of the cohesin ring with the pre-replication complex and the active replication machinery during S phase is a complex and dynamic process, which is perturbed by the absence of STAG2. We speculate that the binding of cohesin with Geminin may represent a critical mediator of an intra-S-phase checkpoint to ensure establishment of sister chromatid cohesion during DNA replication. The disruption of cohesin binding with the replication factors PCNA, PolD, and PolE upon STAG2 depletion may represent either lack of recruitment to the active replication fork or instability and dissociation from the stalled replication fork. Regardless of the mechanism, this results in stalling of DNA synthesis, accumulation of single-stranded DNA binding protein RPA2/p34 at replication sites, and eventually fork collapse (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>).<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Model depicting the role of the cohesin complex during replication fork procession.

Additionally, we find that <italic>STAG2</italic> mutant cancer cells have increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation and cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide and etoposide) that function by inducing DNA double-strand breaks. Furthermore, PARP1 or ATR inhibition constitutes a STAG2 synthetic lethal interaction that can be elicited with clinical inhibitors such as olaparib or AZD6738, which are currently FDA-approved and in phase II clinical trials, respectively. These effects were robust across isogenic cell models of different tumor types, both glioblastoma and Ewing sarcoma, as well as an immortalized epithelial cell line.
