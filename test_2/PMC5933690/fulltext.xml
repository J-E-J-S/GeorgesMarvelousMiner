To this end, state-of-the-art genome editing by use of the CRISPR/Cas system (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein) in mouse zygotes has enabled the fast and scarless introduction of specific mutations with high efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The most commonly used CRISPR/Cas system consists of three basic components: the endonuclease Cas9, the sequence specific crRNA (CRISPR RNA) and the generic tracrRNA (trans-activating crRNA). Naturally occurring as a paired guide RNA (pgRNA) the two sequences have been artificially fused to a single guide RNA (sgRNA) molecule for practical reasons [<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. At the desired locus, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DNA double strand breaks are either repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), resulting in random insertions and deletions (INDELs) or, if a DNA repair template is provided, by homology directed repair (HDR). The latter mechanism can be exploited to introduce site-specific mutations into the locus of interest. While CRISPR/Cas9-mediated transgenesis has emerged as the novel standard technology for the generation of mouse models, the delivery of the necessary components into zygotes still relies on technically demanding and invasive pronuclear injection (PNI). Recently, three independent groups demonstrated electroporation of zygotes as an alternative delivery route for Cas9 mRNA, guide RNAs and short single-stranded oligonucleotides (ssODN) as DNA repair templates for precise CRISPR/Cas9-mediated transgenesis [<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Subsequently, electroporation of pre-assembled Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoproteins (RNP) proved to drastically enhance transgenic efficiencies [<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196891.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, several obstacles within the current protocols hinder the broader application of electroporation: Firstly, they either require the costly investment in a specialized electroporator device or use corrosive pre-treatment of the embryo by acidic Tyrode&#x02019;s solution to allow uptake of the CRISPR/Cas9 components. Weakening of the zona pellucida, a vital part of the embryo, by acidic Tyrode&#x02019;s solution compromises embryo viability [<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] while the necessary incubation time of as short as 10 s [<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] is challenging to be reproducibly applied even for highly experienced users. Furthermore, the batch specific activity of acidic Tyrode&#x02019;s solution [<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] challenges its safe and reproducible application. Secondly, synthetic guide RNAs have recently become commercially available, circumventing laborious preparation of <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed sgRNA. However, the impact of delivering these synthetic guide RNAs by electroporation on embryo viability has not been assessed side-by-side with conventional sgRNA. Thirdly, major results optimizing the electroporation conditions are based on experiments with zygotes from robust F1 hybrid mice whereas the vast majority of research questions demand transgenesis in the more sensitive but most commonly used inbred C57BL/6 mice in order to keep the results comparable and reproducible [<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196891.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196891.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>To overcome these constraints, we combined the current data on electroporation in order to develop an easily adaptable protocol for efficient CRISPR/Cas9-mediated transgenesis of C57BL/6 zygotes with minimal technical demand. We aimed to omit any treatment weakening the zona pellucida and to establish the protocol on a standard electroporation device. Utilization of commercially available CRISPR/Cas9 components, most importantly synthetic guide RNAs, further simplified the process and enhanced the reproducibility as well as the embryo viability. We found that our improved CRISPR electroporation, which we refer to as EEZy (<underline>E</underline>asy <underline>E</underline>lectroporation of <underline>Zy</underline>gotes), enables the introduction of specific mutations as efficient as delivery by conventional PNI while it significantly enhances embryo development <italic>in vitro</italic> and live birth rates <italic>in vivo</italic>. Genome editing accomplished in up to 100% of the founder mice demonstrates complete penetration of zygotes without any weakening of the zona pellucida. Thus, our EEZy approach represents an easily adaptable and broadly applicable technique for CRISPR-mediated mouse transgenesis which outperforms conventional PNI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All mouse protocols were in accordance with European, national and institutional guidelines and approved by the State Office of North Rhine-Westphalia, Department of Nature, Environment and Consumer Protection (LANUV NRW, Germany; animal study protocol AZ 84&#x02013;02_04_2014_A372).

M16 and M2 were prepared as described [<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. C57BL/6NRj zygotes for electroporation were either directly purchased from Janvier Labs (SE-ZYG-CNP) or collected from C57BL/6NRj females. If indicated zygotes from C57BL/6JRj females were used instead. 3-4-week-old donor females (i.e. 12&#x02013;14 g body weight) were superovulated 72 h prior zygote collection by intraperitoneal administration of 5 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (ProSpec, HOR-272 or Aviva Systems Biology, OPPA01037) followed by 5 IU of human chorionic gonadotrophin (Intervet, Ovogest) 48 h later. 0.5 days post coitum (dpc) embryos were collected from the oviducts of donor females upon 1:1 mating with C57BL/6NRj males as described in published protocols [<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

Each Cas9 RNP mix was kept on ice until use. For electroporation, zygotes were washed in batch through 5 drops of M2. After wash through one drop of Opti-MEM the zygotes were transferred with as little media as possible to 20 &#x003bc;l of Cas9 RNP mix. Using a P20 pipette, the entire solution was transferred to a pre-warmed 1 mm cuvette (BioRad, 1652089) and placed in the BioRad Gene Pulser XCell electroporator. Two square wave pulses were applied (30V, 3 ms pulse duration, 2 pulses, 100 ms interval). The zygotes were retrieved from the cuvette using a P100 pipette and two flushes of 100 &#x003bc;l M16 and transferred to a culture dish (Falcon, 353037) containing 500 &#x003bc;l M16. If indicated zygotes were treated with acidic Tyrode&#x02019;s solution (Sigma, T1788) for 10 s and the reaction stopped by adding M2. Zygotes for PNI were exclusively collected from C57BL/6NRj females upon natural mating as described above. After visual inspection for the presence of two pronuclei zygotes were placed in a paraffin oil covered M2 containing injection chamber. Microinjection was performed using an Axio Observer.D1 microscope (Zeiss) and microinjector devices CellTram and FemtoJet with TransferMan NK2 micromanipulators (Eppendorf). The CRISPR/Cas9 solution was injected into the male pronucleus using injection capillaries (BioMedical Instruments, BM100F-10; type PI-1.6). If not stated otherwise the CRISPR/Cas9 injection mix was prepared as described for electroporation but containing 400 nM gRNA, 200nM Cas9 protein, 30 ng/&#x003bc;l Cas9 mRNA (TriLink, L-6125-20) and 500 nM ssODN. Microinjected zygotes were transferred into 500 &#x003bc;l M16 and lysed embryos were removed approximately 1 h after injection. On the next day, 2-cell stage embryos were transferred unilateral into oviducts of pseudo-pregnant 0.5 dpc RjHan:NMRI females or continued to culture until the blastocyst stage at 3.5 dpc.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Genotyping analysis</title><p>DNA of individual blastocyst stage embryos was extracted in 10 &#x003bc;l of QuickExtract DNA extraction solution (Epicentre, QE09050) in a thermocycler at 65&#x000b0;C for 15 min followed by 95&#x000b0;C for 15 min and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until use.

In this study, we established an improved and facile protocol (EEZy) using synthetic CRISPR components in a widely spread electroporation device with intact zygotes derived either from natural mating or from IVF. We demonstrate that zona pellucida weakening is dispensable for efficient generation of mutant mice <italic>in vivo</italic> by our EEZy approach. Pre-treatment of zygotes by acidic Tyrode&#x02019;s solution has been initially established to increase the permeability of the zona pellucida for large RNA molecules during electroporation and has been subsequently shown to be necessary for gene editing using Cas9 mRNA of about 4,500 nucleotides length [<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196891.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Uptake of small molecules like morpholinos of only 25 nucleotides length, however, neither required nor greatly benefited from acidic Tyrode&#x02019;s pre-treatment of zygote prior to electroporation [<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We accomplished highly efficient gene editing in embryos and living offspring by EEZy with Cas9 RNP complexes and small DNA repair templates of about 150 nucleotides length. The sufficient permeability of intact zygotes in our experiments may be explained by the compact nature of the Cas9 RNP complex in contrast to large Cas9 mRNA. Recently, long ssODN repair templates of about 1,500 nucleotides length have been successfully used for generation of mutant mice by CRISPR-PNI [<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Assuming low permeability of intact zygotes for large nucleic acids, it is conceivable that zona pellucida weakening might still be valuable for electroporation of these long ssODNs. For the same purpose, the pulse frequency or duration during EEZy may be increased to facilitate enhanced uptake of nucleic acids. Although the current parameters have been identified as the ideal balance between editing efficiency and embryo survival previously [<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] it has been demonstrated that gene editing of difficult targets may benefit from increased pulse frequencies or durations. However, in this case lower embryo viability is inevitable [<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196891.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196891.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Our results revealed significant less embryo toxicity of synthetic pgRNAs as compared to sgRNAs from <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription during our EEZy approach.

We hypothesize that the ten times higher amounts of guide RNA needed during EEZy may account for the elevated embryo toxicity of sgRNAs during EEZy. Although it remains interesting whether the nature of the sgRNA or traces from its generation and purification, respectively, are responsible for the embryo toxicity, our data validate synthetic pgRNAs as less harmful during electroporation.

Although they did not compare pgRNA and sgRNA side-by-side their data nicely confirm our finding that synthetic pgRNA is indeed an efficient and safe alternative to conventional sgRNA.</p><p>Successful CRISPR-mediated generation of large genomic integrations by electroporation of plasmid targeting vectors into mouse zygotes has not been published to date. Interestingly, an equivalent attempt of such integration by electroporation most recently also failed in rat zygotes [<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The data suggested that plasmid vectors do not reach the nucleus although they were detected in the cytosol of the embryo upon electroporation. We therefore speculate that insufficient permeability of the nuclear membrane may also be responsible for the fact that we did not detect any transgene integration upon EEZy with a plasmid targeting vector.</p><p>The presence of visible pronuclei, a requirement for conventional PNI, is dispensable for EEZy. Our data demonstrate for the first time that blastocysts from zygotes without visible pronuclei display the same HDR editing rates as blastocysts from zygotes with visible pronuclei. When performing CRISPR-PNI in our daily routine we therefore electroporated this PNI-incompatible zygote fraction to evaluate the guide RNA efficiency for future projects in <italic>in vitro</italic> blastocyst assays. In these assays targeted zygotes are cultured to the blastocyst stage and genotyped by PCR [<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless, when we electroporated the fraction of zygotes without two visible pronuclei we observed significantly less developed blastocysts. Although we pre-screen and select zygotes with visible polar bodies as an indicator of fertilization [<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], we cannot exclude that parthenogenetically activated oocytes extruding a polar body may account for this effect [<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Parthenogenetic embryos can develop without any contribution from a male gamete but display limited developmental capacities. Although this has not been investigated in this study, electroporation itself could provide a stimulus for parthenogenetic activation.</p><p>We further found a significantly lower toxicity of our EEZy approach in direct comparison to PNI. While delivery of CRISPR components by PNI has been reported to induce physical damage and impede embryo development [<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], EEZy had virtually no impact on embryo development and subsequently resulted in higher numbers of offspring. These findings are in line with published results of improved pre-implantation development from B6D2F1 hybrid zygotes [<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and higher live birth rates of inbred C57BL/6J mice from zygotes after CRISPR electroporation as compared to PNI [<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, we show for the first time that higher numbers of embryos can be retrieved after electroporation due to less acute damage observed during PNI. In fact, we have hardly ever observed immediate lysis of embryos employing EEZy which may additionally result from the higher resistance of intact zygotes compared to zona pellucida weakened zygotes [<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Along this line, our data demonstrate the potential of EEZy to profoundly decrease animal numbers needed for the generation of transgenic mice. Reduction of animal numbers is one of the key aspects of the 3R principles (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement) for good animal welfare in research [<xref rid="pone.0196891.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. During CRISPR-mediated transgenesis, either by electroporation or PNI, animals are needed for collecting zygotes and as recipient foster females for the targeted embryos. Due to enhanced embryo viability and development EEZy lowers the demand for both, the zygote donors and recipient females in comparison to conventional PNI highlighting the value of this technique for more humane animal research.</p><p>In summary, with EEZy we established a simplified and easily adaptable electroporation procedure using intact C57BL/6N and C57BL/6J zygotes for highly efficient CRISPR/Cas9-mediated generation of specific mutant mice with minimal impact on embryo viability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec010"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0196891.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Sanger sequencing of representative <italic>Nphs2</italic>-targeted blastocysts.</title><p>Sequencing results of the indicated blastocysts from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196891.g001">Fig 1A</xref>.
