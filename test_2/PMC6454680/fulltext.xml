Here, we present the first report to compare the cheaper BGISEQ-500 platform to the Illumina HiSeq platform for scRNA-seq. We generate a resource of 468 single cells and 1297 matched single cDNA samples, performing SMARTer and Smart-seq2 protocols on two cell lines with RNA spike-ins. We sequence these libraries on both platforms using single- and paired-end reads. The platforms have comparable sensitivity and accuracy in terms of quantification of gene expression, and low technical variability. Our study provides a standardized scRNA-seq resource to benchmark new scRNA-seq library preparation protocols and sequencing platforms.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s13059-019-1676-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Single-cell RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>Sequencing platforms</kwd><kwd>Benchmarking scRNA-seq</kwd><kwd>Illumina sequencing</kwd><kwd>BGISEQ-500</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>European Research Council ()</institution></funding-source><award-id>260507</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teichmann</surname><given-names>Sarah A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Wellcome Trust (GB)</institution></funding-source><award-id>105031/B/14/Z</award-id><award-id>108437/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Natarajan</surname><given-names>Kedar Nath</given-names></name><name><surname>Miao</surname><given-names>Zhichao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Syddansk Universitet (DK)</institution></funding-source><award-id>Danish-Institute of Advanced Study</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Natarajan</surname><given-names>Kedar Nath</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008398</institution-id><institution>Villum Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>00025397</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Natarajan</surname><given-names>Kedar Nath</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF18OC0052874</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Natarajan</surname><given-names>Kedar Nath</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par2">Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has become the established approach to dissect cellular heterogeneity, unravel cell states, and identify subpopulation structures across different cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The different scRNA-seq methods and technologies have been benchmarked using synthetic RNA spike-ins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, to date, most scRNA-seq methods require cDNA libraries to be compatible with short-read Illumina sequencing platform.</p><p id="Par3">The most widely used Illumina platform uses a stepwise sequencing by polymerase approach. The libraries are made by fragmentation of bulk or single-cell cDNA, followed by the addition of custom adaptors. The template is flooded across a patterned flow cell to bind with immobilized primers and washed to remove unbound ends. The bound but free template ends further interact with nearby primers, forming bridge structures. The second strand is synthesized by PCR using the same primers, followed by washing and re-formation of bridges. This bridge amplification typically generates more than a million copies of each template within the tight physical cluster on the flow cell (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]). A simplified schematic is shown in Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1A. The actual sequencing process itself is termed &#x0201c;sequencing by synthesis.&#x0201d; Here, a mixture of primers, DNA polymerase, and modified nucleotides are added to enriched template on flow cell. During each cycle, fragments within each cluster incorporate a complementary single modified nucleotide with a base-specific, cleavable fluorophore, while unbound fragments are washed away. The flow cell is imaged using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to identify incorporated based, followed by cleavage of modified base. This cycle of nucleotide addition, elongation, and cleavage is repeatedly performed to ascertain the DNA sequence.</p><p id="Par4">The BGISEQ-500 is an alternative short-read sequencing platform, developed by BGI (Beijing Genomics Institute). The BGISEQ-500 works use combinatorial probe-anchor synthesis (cPAS) that combines DNA-Nanoball (DNBs) arrays with stepwise sequencing using DNA polymerase on a flow cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1A). The three key steps in the BGISEQ-500 platform are generation of DNBs, loading DNBs onto a flow cell, and the sequencing of DNA fragments. In cPAS-based sequencing, the template cDNA is first fragmented and size selected (200&#x02013;500&#x02009;bp). The template undergoes four sequential rounds of adaptor ligation, circularization, and cleavage, generating a final circularized template with four unique adaptors. The circular templates undergo rolling circle amplification (RCA) to produce a large mass of DNA concatemers (DNBs) and are finally immobilized and sequenced on a flow cell using combinatorial probe-anchor synthesis (cPAS). Across the flow cell, the DNBs bind to an anchor and fluorescent probe (complementary to adaptors). The probes are degenerate (apart from the first position) and capture the first base at either end of the anchor. Each sequencing cycle consists of removing the previous probe, re-ligating to the same anchor with different fluorescent probes, and sequence determination. This cycle is repeated for each of the remaining three adapter sequences to generate paired-end reads (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]). The BGISEQ-500 platform has been previously applied to detection of small noncoding RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], human genome re-sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and palaeogenomic ancient DNA sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], but not to scRNA-seq.</p><p id="Par5">One of the key differences between the BGISEQ-500 and Illumina platforms is the sequencing cost, calculated from yield per run. These sequencing costs are typically subject to geographical, institutional pricing and continue to decline. Typically, the cost per gigabase (Gb) on BGISEQ-500 is 40&#x02013;60% of Illumina HiSeq4000 platform, without accounting for physical sequencer cost (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S1). The combination of higher throughput (~&#x02009;2&#x000d7;) with marginally increased cost (10&#x02013;15%) per lane makes the BGISEQ-500 an attractive alternative. This is important in scRNA-seq, where significant multiplexing is required alongside considerable read depth per cell.</p><p id="Par6">Here, we assess the suitability of BGISEQ-500 sequencing platform for scRNA-seq and compare with the Illumina HiSeq platform using matched single-cell data.</p><p id="Par7">We perform two different scRNA-seq methods (SMARTer and Smart-seq2) on mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and human K562 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. We chose mESCs and K562 cells as two widely used mouse and human cell lines, which have been profiled in large-scale consortia (e.g., ENCODE) and in studies benchmarking single-cell protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For comparison, we utilize RNA-spike-ins including External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCCs) and Spike-in RNA Variants (SIRVs). The ERCCs and SIRVs span 92 synthetic RNA species and 69 artificial transcripts, respectively, of varying lengths, concentrations, GC contents, isoforms, and abundance levels. We benchmark and compare two performance metrics (<italic>sensitivity</italic> and <italic>accuracy</italic>) on single cells using two different protocols and across Illumina and BGISEQ-500 sequencing platform.</p><p id="Par8">We have previously applied these performance metrics to compare different scRNA-seq protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. As in our previous framework, the &#x0201c;sensitivity&#x0201d; or molecular detection limit is defined as the minimum number of RNA spike-in molecules detected within a single cell. The &#x0201c;accuracy&#x0201d; refers to the correlation between the estimated abundances of input RNA spike-ins and the known input molecules added to single-cell reaction (ground truth) (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1B&#x02013;C). Specifically, the single-cell sensitivity is computed using a logistic regression model with spike-in RNA detection as a dependent variable across platforms. The sensitivity is measured as the input spike-in abundance level, where the detection probability reaches 50% (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1B). This approach minimizes biases due to batch effects (uneven sizes, sampling, and variable spike-in detection). The accuracy is calculated using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (<italic>R</italic>) between estimated spike-in expression from sequencing and the a priori known input spike-in concentration (ground truth) in log space, for each individual cell (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1C, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Supplementary methods).</p><p id="Par9">In this study, we perform the first systematic scRNA-seq comparison across two sequencing platforms, using 1297 matched cDNA samples from 468 unique single cells using two scRNA-seq protocols. We compare and assess the accuracy, sensitivity, and robustness of BGISEQ-500 library preparation and sequencing platform with the current state-of-art Illumina HiSeq platform. Our large dataset contains single- and paired-end reads (50 and 100&#x02009;bp) for batch-matched mESCs and K562s, which is a large data resource for comparison of new protocols and benchmarking computational methods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par10">We performed two scRNA-seq protocols (SMARTer and Smart-seq2) in parallel on 288 single-mESCs using both ERCCs and SIRVs spike-ins on Fluidigm C1-system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The Smart-seq2 protocol was performed in replicates (SM2 replicate 1 and 2) using mESCs batches. The single-cell lysis, reverse transcription, and pre-amplification for all methods were done within the C1-system. Each chamber within the C1 chip was visually validated to contain a single cell and to avoid bad chambers (doublet, debris, and dead cells; Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Supplementary methods).</p><p id="Par11">We used the same &#x0201c;matched&#x0201d; single-cell cDNA from 288 cells, across SMARTer and Smart-seq2 protocols, and generated 576 single-cell libraries for both Illumina HiSeq2500 and BGISEQ-500 platforms (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].

Across single cells, the fragment size distribution, read coverage over genes, dropout rates, and expression variation were quite similar between both sequencing platforms (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1D). We also devised pseudo-bulk by pooling all single cells together and observed high correlations between sequencing platforms and protocols (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1E).</p><p id="Par13">Next, we calculated the sensitivity and accuracy using both sets of spike-ins across matched single cells across both platforms (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2A&#x02013;B). Globally, the single-cell accuracy was similar across the sequencing platforms, irrespective of scRNA-seq protocol (<italic>R</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.66&#x02013;0.70, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2B; violin plots in Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2C). The sensitivity (i.e., detection limit) was similar across scRNA-seq protocols and ranged from 21 to 47 molecules (number of RNA molecules <italic>#M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;21&#x02013;47, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2A; violin plots in Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2D) between sequencing platforms. The detection limit was slightly lower for BGISEQ-500 platforms, likely due to highly sequencing depth. Surprisingly, we could detect as few as 12 molecules across one of the Smart-seq2 protocol replicates (SM2-seq replicate 1; Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2D).</p><p id="Par14">Given that sensitivity can be dependent on sequencing depth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], we compared the distribution of reads across single cells. The single cells were more deeply sequenced across BGISEQ-500 platform, accounting for slightly increased sensitivity (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2E). This also increased the detected genes in BGISEQ-500 compared to Illumina platform (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2F). Interestingly, we cultured these mESCs in media containing serum and LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor), where stem cell and differentiating subpopulations have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In one of our Smart-seq2 protocol replicates (SM2-seq replicate1), we could discern two subpopulations based on the number of genes (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2F). We classified all single cells based on the number of genes expressed across platforms (Illumina &#x0003e;&#x02009;5000 and BGI &#x0003e;&#x02009;7500 genes) and observed that these subpopulations expressed different levels of pluripotency markers. The more pluripotent cells (Illumina &#x0003e;&#x02009;5000 and BGI &#x0003e;&#x02009;7500 genes) expressed higher levels of stem cell markers (Illumina &#x0003e;&#x02009;5000 and BGI &#x0003e;&#x02009;7500 genes), while the differentiated-like cells had fewer expressed genes and lower, stochastic gene expression (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2F&#x02013;G) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

This allows us to compare the platforms at different sequencing depths and also estimate where saturation of sequencing occurs. Both sensitivity and accuracy were highly similar across single cells between scRNA-seq protocols and sequencing platforms, upon downsampling (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b&#x02013;c). The detection limit was consistent between scRNA-seq protocols and sequencing platforms (<italic>#M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;46&#x02013;73), with the sensitivity reaching saturation around ~&#x02009;2.8 million reads (red dashed line; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The accuracy was also consistent (<italic>R</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.62~0.67) between platforms, reaching saturation at ~&#x02009;2.5 million reads (red dashed line; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c).</p><p id="Par16">We next assessed the matched single-cell similarity across platforms by comparing either total expression (Genes + spike-ins) or for spike-ins alone. We accounted for sequencing depth by downsampling to 1 million reads per single cell, as this has shown to be enough for single-cell analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. We performed principal component analysis (PCA) and plot each matched cell by representing the sequencing platforms, where the distance between them is a measure of gene expression similarity (dashed line; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). The PCA captures strong similarity between matched cells (short distance) across platforms for most of the single cells across both platforms, with low PC1 (8&#x02013;14%) and PC2 (4%) contribution. The PCA separates the pluripotent subpopulation from outlier cells (bad cells) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). This is most apparent in Smart-seq2 protocol replicate 1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d; first panel), where the largest subpopulation (left) corresponds to pluripotent cells, while the smallest subpopulation is differentiating-like cells (top-center; see also Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2G) with a group of low-quality outliers (with large inter-cell distances; see also Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2G).</p><p id="Par17">We re-performed PCA using both sets of spike-ins (without genes) on matched single cells to re-validate the subpopulations and to control for any technical bias arising from endogenous genes. As expected, the matched cells in resulting PCA were uniform with similar distances and low PC1 (~&#x02009;7%) and PC2 (~&#x02009;5&#x02013;6%) variation between platforms (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3A). Across Smart-seq2 protocol replicate 1, we could re-confirm the two subpopulations (same as in Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2F&#x02013;G). The larger subpopulation corresponds to pluripotent cells expressing more genes with fewer spike-ins detected, while the other subpopulation had higher spike-ins. We also compared the single-cell sensitivities for matched cells both before and after downsampling. The rationale is that without downsampling, single-cell correlations would be poorer due to sequencing depth variation, and skewed towards the more deeply sequenced BGISEQ-500 data.

We used the matched single-cell cDNA from mESCs and K562s to generate 600 BGISEQ-500 sequencing libraries in both single- and paired-end configurations and 121 HiSeq 4000 paired-end sequencing libraries (721 sequencing libraries in total) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a; Additional&#x000a0;files&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>, and <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Table S2, S3, S4, and S5).

Single-cell transcriptomic profiling is a multi-step sampling procedure, where the first major step involves cell lysis, RNA capture, reverse transcription of RNA, preamplification of cDNA generation. The next major step requires single-cell cDNA to be converted into a sequencing compatible library, followed by sequencing. There are several scRNA-seq protocols that utilize different chemistries, platforms, and technologies to address the first critical step of converting RNA into cDNA. The technical variation, performance metrics (sensitivity, accuracy), and reproducibility for the first critical step have been recently evaluated and benchmarked using synthetic RNA spike-in molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, all the scRNA-seq protocols and technologies require libraries to be compatible for sequencing on short-read Illumina platform.</p><p id="Par28">Here we explore an alternative BGISEQ-500 short-read sequencing platform for scRNA-seq that uses combinatorial probe-anchor synthesis (cPAS). Unlike Illumina, BGISEQ-500 platform performs template enrichment using rolling circle amplification on DNA-Nanoballs combined with stepwise sequencing for template amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1A). One of the biggest advantages of BGISEQ-500 is the cost and throughput per run (Gb/per run). It is important to highlight that the sequencing costs continue to decline yearly and reagent and personnel costs across facilities are often subject to geographical and institutional pricing, making it difficult to compare exact costs. However, a typical BGISEQ-500 100&#x02009;bp paired-end run generates 120&#x02013;130&#x02009;Gb (1.8-2x Illumina throughput) at 10&#x02013;15% increased cost per lane. This can be especially useful for full-length scRNA-seq, where both multiplexing and higher sequencing depth per cell is required. On the other hand, Illumina platform is the current state of the art with reagents widely available, used, and benchmarked.</p><p id="Par29">Our study is the first to utilize BGISEQ-500 platform for scRNA-seq. Our comprehensive benchmarking of performance metrics utilizes two scRNA-seq protocols (SMARTer and Smart-seq2), multiple spike-ins (ERCC alone, ERCC+SIRV), two different cell lines (mESCs, K562s), and two technologies (Fluidigm C1, plate-based) across Illumina HiSeq and BGISEQ-500 platform. Utilizing 468 single K562 and mESCs and matched 1297 single-cell libraries, we observe BGISEQ-500 to be highly comparable in sensitivity, accuracy, and reproducibility to Illumina platform, while being considerably more cost-effective.</p><p id="Par30">From our mESC scRNA-seq dataset, we could distinguish technical artifacts (sequencing depth) from biological variation (subpopulations) across both sequencing platforms. We observe differential alternative splicing events between K562s and mESCs across both sequencing platforms. We observe some RNA degradation in few single-cell libraries, which we believe is due to transport of samples. Our data using mESCs and K562s across two scRNA-seq protocols supports the notion that minimal variability is introduced during library preparation and sequencing for both Illumina and BGISEQ-500 platforms. In combination with our previous framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], we believe that variability between the steps of scRNA-seq protocols is largest during the RNA to cDNA step. Both the performance metrics and single-cell characteristics (number of genes, expression range, subpopulation, etc.) suggest that BGISEQ-500 library preparation and sequencing are robust and comparable to Illumina platforms for single-cell applications.</p><p id="Par31">We observe minimal variability in cDNA processing across different library preparation and sequencing platforms. In the current study, we did not perform scRNA-seq protocols with Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) that account for PCR amplification biases. Given that UMIs primarily address biases during the RNA-to-cDNA stage (and to cDNA amplification), this would have minimal or no impact on our assessment of sequencing platforms. The scRNA-seq UMI-based protocols could easily be extended to be compatible with sequencing on BGISEQ-500 platform. Our large resource for benchmarking scRNA-seq data suggests that the BGISEQ-500 platform is suitable for plate-based (microwell or nanowell), droplet, and microfluidics technologies.</p><p id="Par32">In addition to benchmarking, we provide a large comprehensive multi-cell type, protocol, and platform scRNA-seq dataset spanning 468 cells and 1297 libraries in both single- and paired-end configuration to the community. Given the large research initiatives profiling transcriptomes of single cells in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and Human, such as the Human Cell Atlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], achieving high-quality and cost-effective methods is paramount.
