Defective stress responses are implicated in many human diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Phenol derivatives, naturally occurring and synthetic, display beneficial as well as detrimental effects. The phenol derivatives in this study, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and bisphenol A (BPA), are widely used as food preservatives and industrial chemicals. Conflicting results have been reported regarding their biological activity and correlation with disease development; understanding the molecular basis of phenol action is a key step for addressing issues relevant to human health. This work presents the first comparative genomic analysis of the genetic networks for phenol stress response in an evolutionary context of two divergent yeasts, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Genomic screening of deletion strain libraries of the two yeasts identified genes required for cellular response to phenol stress, which are enriched in human orthologs. Functional analysis of these genes uncovered the major signaling pathways involved. The results provide a global view of the biological events constituting the defense process, including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, phenol detoxification by V-ATPases, reactive oxygen species alleviation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress relief through ergosterol and the unfolded protein response, revealing novel roles for these cellular pathways.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>comparative genomic screen</kwd><kwd>phenol stress response in yeasts</kwd><kwd>cell cycle regulation and DNA repair</kwd><kwd>ergosterol and V-ATPase</kwd><kwd>UPR</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="30"/><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Eukaryotic cells have evolved elaborate mechanisms to precisely sense and efficiently respond to various environmental perturbations arising from internal and external insults. Cells respond to stress in a variety of ways ranging from activating repair pathways for cell recovery to eliciting programmed cell death for elimination of damaged cells. A pathological stress response is a hallmark of many common human diseases including cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders, as well as several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Fulda <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Karam <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). Signaling pathways have been identified that are activated in response to various stress conditions including alterations in nutrients, temperature, pH, osmolarity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS); however, what the connections among pathways are and how they integrate into a coordinated network for stress response, remain poorly understood as fundamental questions in stress biology (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ho and Gasch 2015</xref>).</p><p>Phenols comprise a diverse class of naturally abundant and synthetic compounds that are widely employed by the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and bisphenol-A (BPA) are three phenol model molecules used in our study. BHA, BHT, and BPA share a phenol unit but have either distinct functional groups or specific arrangements of some common groups with the benzene ring. BHA and BHT are used as food additives due to their antioxidant properties (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Williams <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>), while BPA is a high production-volume chemical for manufacture of polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins, and present in many household items (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hormann <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). Conflicting reports regarding their anti-oxidant and genotoxic properties exist. A recent study using <italic>S</italic><italic>. cerevisiae</italic> reported that BHA, BHT, and BPA are cytotoxic and BHA is a potential carcinogen (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Negritto <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>); however, little has been explored regarding global signaling pathways responsible for biological consequences of the phenol derivatives.</p><p>In this study, we took a comparative genomics approach with two divergent yeasts to investigate the conserved response pathways to phenol derivatives as stress molecules, exploring the molecular connections among these pathways. We have identified a large number of genes required for coping with the phenol stress for cell survival. The results provide a global picture of the cellular defense process, including stress-activated protein kinase signaling, cell cycle block, DNA damage and repair, phenol detoxification by V-ATPases, intracellular ROS reduction through ergosterol synthesis, and cellular stress alleviation by the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), representing novel functions of these known cellular pathways. Significantly, the genes identified in this comparative genomics approach are enriched in disease-associated human orthologs, which underscores the important cellular processes to consider when evaluating the human health consequences of phenol derivatives.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials And Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Strains and deletion libraries</title><p>Routine yeast cell culture and standard genetic methods were carried out as described previously (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Moreno <italic>et al.</italic> 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Alfa <italic>et al.</italic> 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Burke <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Forsburg and Rhind 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Tang and Edwalds-Gilbert 2016</xref>). <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains were grown in rich medium, yeast extract plus supplements (YES) or yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD), respectively, or minimal medium (MM) with appropriate supplements.

Serial dilutions of a saturated culture of each strain were spotted onto control plates as well as plates containing BHA (0.33 mM), BHT (0.3 mM), or BPA (0.8 mM) and colony growth spots for each strain were quantified by digitization. GSV&#x02019;s were calculated based on three trials of the spot assays and the average values obtained were used for generating growth profiles of deletion mutants and the corresponding clustering analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and S9).

For example, the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/S000001072/overview">Slt2</ext-link> kinase mediates activation of the ER stress surveillance (ERSU) pathway (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Babour <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>), and the <italic>S. cerevisiae &#x02206;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/S000001072/overview">slt2</ext-link></italic> strain is sensitive to BHA (S10).

As expected, no significant splicing occurred over the 10 hr in the presence of the DMSO solvent alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, control panel). Cells exposed to 0.5 mM BHA showed increased <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/S000001863/overview">HAC1</ext-link></italic> pre-mRNA splicing by the 2-h time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, BHA panel, lane 3) compared with 0-hour time point (lane 2), indicating the activation of the UPR pathway. After four hours, however, there was clear attenuation of the response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, BHA panel, lanes 5-7), as the spliced <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/S000001863/overview">HAC1</ext-link></italic> RNA transcripts dropped considerably (from 51&#x02013;37% to 1%). The activation and attenuation of UPR induced by BHA is thus quick and short, represented by a sharp peak of <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/S000001863/overview">HAC1</ext-link></italic> pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, BHT treatment resulted in consistent low levels of <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/S000001863/overview">HAC1</ext-link></italic> pre-mRNA splicing starting at 2 h and continuing 10 h after exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, BHT panel, compare lanes 3-7 with lane 2).

The results suggest that BHA and BHT may trigger differential levels of UPR in cells, while BPA may not elicit the UPR at all.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="other1" id="s23"><title>Summary</title><p>The comparative genomic approach of our studies using divergent <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> offers a global picture of the response pathways to the phenol stress, revealing information about the novel roles of several cellular processes in the cellular defense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). First, the genome-scale data presented in this paper offer strong support for the genotoxic action of BHA, BHT, and BPA, potentially leading to genome instability. Second, this study provides the first genetic evidence for targeting major regulators in cell cycle control and cast players linking the Sty1 SAPK (stress-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway to the phase transitions of cell cycle under the phenol stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Third, components conserved from yeasts to humans and their corresponding functional annotations, allow us to gain an overall perspective of the cellular events taking place upon phenol stress response. These processes include cell cycle arrest to re-allocate cellular energy from cell proliferation to repair processes, DNA repair for error-free inheritance, detoxification through V-ATPase, ergosterol synthesis and UPR for temporarily coping with the stress for ultimate survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Fourth, hypergeometric tests indicate significant enrichment of genes with human orthologs in both yeasts. In addition, disease-associated genes are enriched in <italic>S. pombe</italic>. The identified major pathways in the two divergent yeasts underscore the cellular processes that are informative for evaluating the human health consequences of phenol derivatives. Finally, the evolutionary spectrum gained by the comparative genomic approach and further examinations in this study enabled us to not only identify the common pathways involved but also recognize potential molecular links in orchestrating the intricate signaling into a concerted response network under the phenol stress.</p><fig id="fig6" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Proposed model of conserved major cellular pathways constituting the networks in response to the phenol stress. Diagrams shown are based on all screens performed in this study presenting main processes and players identified. Dark red, BHA-responsive protein; green, BHT-responsive protein; yellow, BPA-responsive protein. <italic>S. pombe</italic> proteins are depicted as a rod shape and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proteins are depicted as a circle. The phenol derivatives may enter the yeast cells by diffusion or by active transport systems through the membrane. As pro-oxidants, cumulative dosages of these compounds may increase the intracellular ROS, trigger cellular response including stress-activated protein kinase signaling, cell cycle arrest, DNA damage/repair system activation, pH adjustment by V-ATPase, and UPR induction for cell defense. Some proteins in these pathways/processes encoded by genes identified in this study are included as examples.
