The most widely studied small RNAs are miRNA that regulate protein-coding expression post-transcriptionally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. MiRNA expression profiles in tissues or cell populations are highly informative to reveal cellular states, such as in human cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and identify cellular mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The advances of single-cell genomics have raised the prospect that single-cell miRNA profiles could add another dimension to small RNA research by facilitating the molecular understanding of intercellular heterogeneity. Unlike single-cell RNAseq techniques, which have matured considerably in the past years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, single-cell small RNA sequencing has been demonstrated very recently and applied to differentiating naive versus primed human embryonic stem cells and examining intercellular heterogeneity of miRNA expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, with the latter confirming previous findings of single-cell miRNA measurements by lower throughput methods such as quantitative RT-PCR or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, given the roles of small RNAs to modulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, for example, via miRNA-mediated degradation of target transcripts, it is important to measure both small RNAs and mRNAs at the genome-scale in order to decipher the mechanism underlying observed intercellular miRNA and mRNA heterogeneity. We thus envision that obtaining miRNA and mRNA profiles from the same single cells could empower studying how miRNAs modulate non-genetic cell-to-cell variability post-transcriptionally and how miRNA variability could be modulated via protein-coding genes.</p><p id="Par4">Over the past years, technology breakthroughs in single-cell omics have enabled genome-wide profiling of genetic mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, copy number variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, DNA methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, chromatin-accessibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, and gene expression at the transcriptional level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

Genome-wide profiling of both mRNAs and post-transcriptional regulators such as miRNAs remains challenging, due in part to the incompatibility of current mRNA-seq and small RNA sequencing protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Strategies such as separation of miRNAs from mRNAs are not yet reliable for single-cell co-measurement of both types of RNAs at the genome-scale.</p><p id="Par5">We report here the co-sequencing of single-cell small RNA and mRNA transcriptomes using a half-cell genomics approach, which has been built upon our prior success in direct capture and profiling of miRNAs in low-quantity whole cell lysate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and the rigorous validation of half-cell sampling to reliably represent the whole cell RNA expression levels.

For profiling miRNA expression in half cells, we modified our previous method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> to develop a protocol for generating small RNA sequencing library from single cells or half-cell-level materials. In this protocol, single-cell lysate was heated to release miRNAs for sequential ligation reactions with 3&#x02032;- and 5&#x02032;-molecular adaptors and then the ligated products were reverse transcribed, and amplified with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for library preparation and next-generation sequencing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). For profiling mRNAs, we used SMART-Seq (v4), a commercialized kit for manual processing of low-input or single-cell poly-adenylated mRNAs to generate full-length libraries for RNA sequencing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). As detailed below, we successfully developed, combined, and validated these methods to generate sequencing libraries from half-cell materials and the half-cell miRNA and mRNA profiles faithfully capture single-cell transcriptomes.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Experimental workflow. <bold>a</bold> Overall strategy for profiling miRNA and mRNA from the same single cells using half-cell genomics.

The best experiment to address this question is to measure variability between two half-cell materials split evenly from the same single cell. We first evaluated this approach to profiling miRNAs. A single K562 human acute myeloid leukemia cell was transferred to and lysed in a PCR tube. The lysate (total volume ~10&#x02009;&#x003bc;l) was eventually split into two halves into two PCR tubes to independently perform small RNA capture, amplification, and preparation of sequencing libraries as described in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>. The sequencing data from each of these two halves were compared against each other for miRNA expression, which gave rise to an <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value of 0.930 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), indicating low technical noise and high consistency.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Profiling of miRNAs from half-cell lysate. <bold>a</bold> A single K562 cell was lysed, and two halves of the lysate were separately subjected to small RNA sequencing.

Interestingly, we observed selective enrichment or depletion of a group of miRNAs in one half-cell sample presumably due to the binding to intracellular proteins. This remains to be further investigated. In this work, we modified the lysis protocol in several steps (see Methods) including introducing freeze/thaw and heat treatment, which eventually led to a robust procedure to evenly split miRNAs in two half-cell samples (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). We further examined the validity of this half-cell approach using different cell types and another measurement technique. Small RNA libraries were generated from two halves of a single murine hematopoietic BaF3 cell, or single K562 and 293T cells, and measured with a Luminex bead array assay. The results again exhibited a high degree of concordance between these two half cells (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). While two half-cell samples from the same single cell&#x000a0;gave rise to high concordance in miRNA profiles, different&#x000a0;single cells obtained from the same cell population exhibited a higher degree of variability by both qRT-PCR analysis and expression profiling (Supplementary Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>),</p><p id="Par9">Upon validating the consistency of the half-cell approach to capture single-cell miRNA profiles, we turned to measure intercellular variability by sequencing 20 half-cell K562 miRNA samples. The other halves of the same cells were processed for RNAseq (to be described in next section). The sequencing data from 19 single cells passed the quality check for both miRNAs and mRNAs. The one that failed the quality assessment had very low levels of mappable reads in both miRNA and mRNA data presumably due to the poor quality of this cell itself (e.g., cell damaged in the capture and transfer process). Principal component analysis (PCA) of these 19 samples and 2 half-cell samples derived from the same cell further confirmed high concordance in two half-cell splits and the variability among single cells is higher, suggesting the existence of intercellular heterogeneity of miRNA expression (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Overall, the success rate (95%) to obtain quality sequencing libraries for both miRNA and mRNA using the half-cell genomics approach was excellent.</p><p id="Par10">The intercellular variability of miRNA expression could be directly observed in our data either by a correlation matrix (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>) or by quantifying the standard deviation of log2-transformed miRNA expression versus the mean expression across 19 half cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). As expected, low expression level miRNAs showed inherently large standard deviations in log2 data. The variation of high abundance miRNAs gradually decreased as the expression level increased. MiR-92a-3p was detected as the most abundant miRNA in our K562 cell sample, in agreement with previous literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Comparing intercellular variability across miRNAs, both miR-146b-5p and let-7i-5p showed higher variability than miRNAs with comparable mean expression levels (for miR-146b-5p, std&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.377; for let-7i-5p, std&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.939). For example, let-7a-5p, a miRNA in the same family as let-7i-5p, had comparable mean expression to let-7i-5p, but with much lower variability (for let-7a-5p, std&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.351). These results showed the direct evidence of intercellular miRNA expression heterogeneity, which differed substantially for individual miRNAs.</p><p id="Par11">To validate the observed intercellular heterogeneity, we performed single-cell qRT-PCR to measure four selected miRNAs, let-7a-5p, let-7i-5p, miR-146b-5p, and miR-92a-3p, in a separate batch of cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Indeed, the variations from single-cell qRT-PCR paralleled those observed in half-cell small RNA sequencing data: miR-92a-3p and let-7a-5p show relatively lower levels of variation (standard deviation std&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.83 and std&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.51, respectively), miR-146b-5p an intermediate level of variation (std&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.57), and let-7i-5p a high level of variation (std&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.64) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). We further determined that these variations could not be fully attributed to genetic differences but instead associated with non-genetic cellular heterogeneity. We generated 17 K562 single-cell clones and measured the same miRNAs using qRT-PCR for each clone (~40,000 cells per clone). One would expect that if the miRNA expression heterogeneity in single cells was driven by genetic differences between cells, large variation would be manifested similarly between single-cell clonal populations because each clone was derived from a single cell and cells within a clone share the genetic variations present in the initial single cell. In contrast, we observed low levels of variability cross these single-cell clones (for miR-92a-3p, std&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.48; for let-7i-5p, std&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.68; for miR-146b-5p, std&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.60) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Collectively, these data support that the half-cell small RNA profiles could faithfully capture single-cell miRNA variability, which allowed us to use half-cell small RNA sequencing to interrogate non-genetic intercellular miRNA heterogeneity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Evaluating the profiling of half-cell mRNA expression</title><p id="Par12">As described above, the 20 single K562 cells processed for half-cell small RNA sequencing were also analyzed for mRNA transcriptomes using the remaining half-cell lysates. SMART-seq was reported to be of high coverage, low bias, and good reproducibility compared to other methods when single-cell data were compared to population, spike-in controls or theoretical predictions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.

Indeed, if all the targets of miR-125a-5p and miR-26a-5p were analyzed without categorization based on their expression levels, we could not detect any significant enrichment. This was obviously due to predicted targets of lower expression diluting out the signal for abundantly expressed targets, the latter of which were of a small fraction among all predicted targets.

We hypothesized that a common upstream regulator controls cellular translation and miR-146b-5p expression in opposite ways. Given that the AKT pathway positively regulates cellular translation, we thus tested the hypothesis that inhibition of AKT could elevate miR-146b-5p expression. We treated K562 cells with an allosteric AKT inhibitor MK-2206, which significantly increased miR-146b-5p expression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>).

Instead, we defined the positive and negative transcriptomic signatures of let-7i-5p by using mRNAs correlated and anti-correlated with this miRNA respectively, and used these signatures to query the CMap, a database of gene expression responses in the presence of chemical perturbation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.

Here, we achieved co-analysis of post-transcriptional regulators (miRNAs) and the mRNA transcriptome in single cells. This was realized with a half-cell genomics approach, which overcomes the challenge to separate and capture small RNAs from mRNA without introducing material loss and technical variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. We evaluated the validity of sequencing half-cell RNA materials to measure single-cell miRNA or mRNA expression profiles, and further combined half-cell miRNA and mRNA profiles from&#x000a0;the same single cells to perform multi-omic analysis. Having the genome-wide miRNA and mRNA profiles from the same single cells permits direct assessment of whether intercellular mRNA transcriptomic heterogeneity is in part shaped by the intercellular variability of the corresponding miRNA regulators. We observed that several abundantly expressed miRNAs, including miR-92a-3p, miR-125a-5p and miR-26a-5p, were more inversely correlated with its predicted targets than non-targets, supporting the above notion. Predicted targets with abundant expression levels were more strongly anti-correlated with the miRNA than predicted targets with lower expression. Why was a stronger anti-correlation observed only for predicted targets of high abundance? One possibility is that the higher technical noise (on log2-transformed data) for genes with low expression levels resulted in the lower degree of statistical significance even if there were correlation between miRNA and targets. Another possibility is that protein-coding genes with low expression levels are more prone to regulation by miRNAs of both high and low abundance, diluting the correlation with any given single miRNA. In contrast, protein-coding genes with high expression levels are susceptible to regulation only by abundantly expressed miRNAs, leading to the preservation of correlation with the corresponding miRNA. This second possibility is consistent with recent findings that support the efficacy of miRNA-mediated regulation being a function of the ratio between miRNAs and targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Overall, our experiments opened up the opportunity to interrogate single cells for post-transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes to modulate mRNA cell-to-cell variability.</p><p id="Par23">In addition to assessing miRNA-based regulation of mRNA heterogeneity, the availability of paired half-cell mRNA and miRNA profiles allowed us to derive informative and verifiable hypotheses on regulatory relationships between cellular pathways and miRNA expression that may contribute to intercellular heterogeneity of miRNA expression. Notably, the expression of miR-146b-5p could be regulated by an AKT inhibitor, which is well recognized to control protein translation. This regulation seems to occur at the level of miRNA maturation, because the primary transcript was reduced yet the mature miRNA was increased. This effect cannot be explained by previous findings of AKT controlling AGO2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, which would predict similar responses to AKT inhibition by all miRNAs. The lack of effect of the AKT inhibitor on other miRNAs (miR-92a-3p and let-7i-5p) and the decrease of primary miR-146b transcript by AKT inhibition indicate that this modulation occurs at a separate step from AGO2 regulation. The exact mechanism requires further studies to elucidate. Similarly, we demonstrated that the let-7 family member let-7i-5p could be downregulated by HDAC inhibition. HDAC inhibition is often associated with activation of gene transcription, which did not seem to occur with let-7i, as the primary transcript of let-7i was not altered, again supporting the existence of post-transcriptional regulation of let-7i-5p by HDAC. It is thus interesting that post-transcriptional regulation of both mRNA and miRNA can be revealed on the single-cell level through co-analysis of mRNA and miRNA transcriptomes.</p><p id="Par24">While our study demonstrated the feasibility and utility of obtaining paired half-cell mRNA and miRNA profiles, our current approach has limited throughput in terms of the number of cells per run.

Microwell arrays were fabricated in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using standard soft lithography. Each array consists of 15,000&#x02013;50,000 microwells, and microwells are sized 55 micron in diameter and 45&#x02009;&#x000b5;m in depth to ensure capture of only one barcoded bead with poly-T-containing probe in each well by size exclusion. Cells were loaded into the device such that only 5&#x02013;10% of the wells were loaded with single cells to prevent cell doublets and verified by microscopy before proceeding further. Once cell loading was completed, beads were loaded into the array at high density to ensure that each well receives a single bead (&#x0003e;95% bead occupancy). Following bead loading, lysis buffer was introduced into the array, and the array was then immediately sealed by introducing fluorinated oil. The cell lysates and beads were then incubated for an hour to capture the released mRNA molecules onto barcoded beads. Beads were then removed from the devices by centrifuging the devices upside down to push the beads out of microwells and flushing them out into an Eppendorf tube. The beads are then processed with subsequent reverse transcription, exonuclease treatment, amplification, and library preparation as in the Dropseq protocol, and sequenced using paired end sequencing.

This pipeline was based on the miRDeep2 package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Briefly, after removing adaptor sequences, collapsing reads with the same sequence, and removal of reads with less than 15 bases in length, small RNA reads were mapped to miRNA precursors from miRBASE release 21 using miRDeep2, allowing zero mismatches. Mapped reads were quantified by miRDeep2. In addition, reads were also mapped to several categories of known RNA species sequentially, using bowtie2. Reads were first mapped to human miRNA precursors, with unmapped reads used in the next step to map to snoRNAs. Similar sequential mapping was performed for snRNA, scRNA, tRNA, rRNA, and piRNAs. Unmapped reads left from the above mapping were also mapped to the genome. However, we found that there are often sequence variants of the ligation adaptors with perfect or near perfect mapping to the genome, thus creating artefacts. We thus did not utilize the mapping to the genome to quantify the mapping results. Overall, among the 19 half cells, total reads that map to miRNA account for 30.18&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.62% (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard deviation, <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;19 cells; same for numbers below) of all reads mapping to the above mentioned RNA species.

This is because some reads were counted multiple times when miRDeep2 assigned them to miRNA precursors, especially for miRNAs that map to multiple genomic loci. The resultant data reflect the fraction of a given miRNA within all miRNAs, which we refer to as miRNA expression or miRNA levels in figures. The validity of using this fraction-based data was supported by single-cell qRT-PCR validation. Normalized data were further applied with a minimal expression level of 10e&#x02212;4 (i.e., all values lower than this threshold were set to this level), and log2-transformed for further analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>RNAseq data analysis</title><p id="Par37">RNAseq data from the half-cell profiles were processed using GenePattern (v3) software.
