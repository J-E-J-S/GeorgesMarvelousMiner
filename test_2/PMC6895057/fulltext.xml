Massimiliano Agostini (University of Tor Vergata, Italy) presented the role of the transcription factor ZNF750 in terminal differentiation of the epidermis. His student, Consuelo Pitolli, presented on the role of the transcription factor ZNF281 in neuroblastoma. Lukas Peintner presented his work on the regulation of DNA damage response in monogenic polycystic kidney disease, proving that loss of polycystin-1 severely impacts Bcl2 family regulation and DNA repair.</p><p id="Par8">Anne Hamacher-Brady (Johns Hopkins University, USA) described that during BAX-mediated MOMP, mitochondria are targeted by endolysosomal vesicles, and that these inter-organelle interactions are fundamental to BAX pore formation in cells. Liora Lindenboim demonstrated that Bax interacts with the nuclear cytoskeleton via interaction with Nesprin proteins and the LINC complex. David Andrews (Sunnybrook Research Institute, Canada) explained how AI analysis of microscopy data can be used to evaluate apoptosis and other cell responses, emphasizing potential utility in precision medicine. His student, Justin Pogmore, presented his work on pharmacologically targeting Bax, while James Pemberton suggested that the mechanism of Puma could explain how neurons commit to either death or axon degeneration. Christoph Borner (University of Freiburg, Germany), showcased a novel interaction between Hexokinase-1 and Puma.</p><p id="Par9">Linda Penn (University Health Network, Canada) and her student Diana Resetca presented the use of MYC-BioID technology for the identification of actionable protein-protein interactions of the MYC family of oncoproteins. Joseph Longo, student of Dr. Penn, demonstrated how the statin family of cholesterol-lowering drugs could be used to induce apoptosis in a specific subset of high-risk multiple myeloma.</p><p id="Par10">Mads Daugaard (Vancouver Prostate Centre, Canada) showed that cisplatin-resistance in bladder cancer can be dissected via genome-wide CRISPR screening and targeted by VAR2-drug conjugates. Chris Kedong Wang showed that cancer exosomes contain high levels of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. Nastaran Khazamipour discussed the progress toward SPY CAR-T cell engineering for elimination of tumor cells, while Negin Farivar reported on engineering a plasmonic photothermal therapy to &#x02018;zap&#x02019; tumor cells in the blood circulation using gold nanorods. Nader Al-Nakouzi spoke about the investigation of hormone-dependent regulation of glycosaminoglycan signaling in prostate cancer.</p><p id="Par11">Ulrich Maurer (University of Freiburg, Germany) reported effects of SPATA2 knockout on immune cells in mice. His student, Laura Griewahn, elucidated the role of SPATA2 in intestinal cells. Mads Gyrd-Hansen (University of Oxford, UK) showed how SPATA2 facilitates CYLD recruitment to TNFR. Thomas Brunner (University of Konstanz, Germany) showed that colorectal tumors can synthesize and release immunosuppressive glucocorticoids, suppressing the anti-tumor immune response. Michael Bergmann (Medical University of Vienna, Austria) presented data indicating that radiotherapy polarizes tumor-associated macrophages from the M2 towards an M1-like phenotype. Johannes L&#x000e4;ngle (Bergmann group) found an impact of proteins associated with DNA damage, ER stress response, immunogenic cell death and stress granules on overall survival in liver metastases. Sebastian Carotta (Boehringer Ingelheim, Vienna) presented the mechanism of the STING pathway in regulating immune and cancer cell death. Molecular oncology work presented by Mahvash Tavassoli (King&#x02019;s College, UK) focused on EGFR dynamics and radiotherapy response in head and neck cancer, and its propagation by HPV infection. Anusha Venkatraman, Student of Christoph Borner, showcased a novel virally-encoded miRNA rendering cells resistant to genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis. Maria Sibilia (Medical University of Vienna, Austria) indicated that targeting EGFR on non-cancerous cells in the tumor microenvironment results in reduced cancer development.</p><p id="Par12">Erwin Wagner (Medical University Vienna, Austria) showed how the dimeric transcription factor AP-1 plays a role in inflammatory skin disease such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and inflammation-associated liver cancer. John Silke (WEHI, Australia) showcased mutations that prevent cleavage of RIPK1 by Caspase-8 induce inflammation in humans and mice.</p><p id="Par13">Rudolf Oehler and his student Vanessa Schimek (Medical University of Vienna, Austria) described the clearance of apoptotic cells by neutrophils and its potential role in tissue regeneration.
