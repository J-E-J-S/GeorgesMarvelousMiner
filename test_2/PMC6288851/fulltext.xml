These extreme environments are those with a chemical composition or constraints imposed by the physical conditions where most organisms cannot survive. Thermophiles are present in several ecosystems where temperatures rise above 50&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and reach up to 90&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. They can grow optimally under these conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], since they have the adaptations and the necessary enzymatic machinery to deal with the complications of living in these extreme environments. Therefore thermophiles are a potential source of thermostable proteins suitable for several industrial and biotechnological applications; then, the screening of novel thermophilic enzymes has become an important field of research. Although several thermostable enzymes have been recently described and characterized (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]), thermophiles are still highly unexplored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], especially because the majority of prokaryotic diversity cannot be cultured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There have only been a few attempts to characterize enzymes or microorganisms from Neotropics hot springs (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]) and just a handful of them (i.e. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]) used metagenomic approaches based on Next Generation Sequencing - NGS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Since metagenomic NGS (from now on just metagenomic) approaches generate millions of short DNA reads of a few hundred bases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], the challenge is to reconstruct the different species individual chromosomes from these reads. In a typical genomic experiment, most of the short reads belong to a single organism, and they can be assembled reliably using the tools that have been developed for this purpose (e.g. Newbler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], Velvet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and Ray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]). However, in a metagenomic experiment there is a mixture of reads from multiple species of a community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; moreover, the number of genomes and the abundance of reads from each species, in the sample, is unknown. These characteristics make the assembly process difficult, since there is a high risk of assembling reads from different organisms as a single chromosome. Tools like MetaVelvet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], Ray Meta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], MetAMOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and SPAdes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] use different approaches to address these issues and improve the assembly opportunities. However, these tools are far from perfect, and chimeric chromosomes can be assembled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">In order to reduce chimeric assemblies, researchers group reads in bins, based on their sequence similarity, to reduce the data complexity and to increase the likelihood of obtaining a reliable assembly. Tools like AMPHORA2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], MEGAN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], MG-Rast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], Kraken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], Clark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] or MetaBinG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] use reference-based methods (i.e. supervised) that bin the reads or contigs into taxonomic clades based on pair-wise comparisons against reference databases, or pre-computed models. Similarly, there are reference-free methods (e.g. unsupervised) like MetaProb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], BiMeta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], MetaCluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], AbundanceBin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] or CompostBin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], that group reads using their genetic mutual similarities or their k-bases frequency composition, avoiding the pair-wise comparison step against reference databases. Supervised methods work fine in reconstructing genomes from well characterized or low-diversity communities, whose taxa have a good representation in reference databases; they exclude reads that come from less explored communities. In contrast, unsupervised methods are better when the species are poorly represented in databases, especially with long reads or contigs that increase the likelihood of finding genetic markers into a sequence to bin them correctly.</p><p id="Par26">Although there are research publications that propose a draft genome of an unknown species extracted from a metagenome (eg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]), only few studies have reported the reconstruction of the complete genome of a thermophilic microbe (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]). In these works, the process has been made mainly manual, using a combination of: Velvet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the study of the total coverage, k-mers characteristics and selecting contigs manually based on BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] results. In general, de-novo assembly of metagenome reads tends to generate short and chimeric contigs that are difficult to classify. Thus, the challenge of analyzing a metagenome is still open; we propose a tool that overcomes some of the limitation of traditional binning methods, mainly for metagenomes formed by unknown species.</p><p id="Par27">Here, we introduce CLAME, a tool that groups metagenome reads in bins mainly from a single chromosome. The idea is to reduce the metagenomic complexity, to decreases the possibility of creating chimeric contigs and to improve the assembly speed. CLAME, from the Spanish &#x0201c;CLAsificador MEtagenomico&#x0201d;, is a C++ program that bins reads using a graph representation of the metagenome dataset. On the graph, reads are represented as nodes (vertices) and the overlap between two similar reads is represented as the edge that connects them. CLAME creates edges only on large exact matches between reads. This makes it very unlikely that two reads from different chromosome molecules can be clustered together. We found that this technique creates bins mostly from a single chromosome, while assigning most reads of one particular chromosome on a single bin. It is important to note that CLAME is not an assembly tool, it is a binning tool that groups reads as a preliminary step before genome assembly. We calibrated CLAME using public available NGS data from 454 and Illumina MiSeq platforms, and we tested it with a metagenomic dataset obtained from a never before studied Andean hot spring. CLAME allowed us to generate a high-quality draft genome (available in CLAME&#x02019;s GitHub and on the NCBI&#x02019;s project PRJNA431299) of a <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic> closely related to <italic>Dokdonella</italic> genus, which seems to represent a new lineage within the family <italic>Rhodanobacteraceae</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par28">CLAME groups metagenomic reads in bins using their biological and shotgun sequencing properties. The fundamental biological idea of CLAME is that exact matches, of a large number of bases, between reads is very unlikely if the reads do not come from same DNA chromosome. Furthermore, assuming that in a metagenome there is a genome sufficiently covered, and given that the sequencing errors is low (on platforms like Illumina Mi-seq or Roche&#x02019;s 454), most reads from a DNA chromosome will have exact matches between them. This way CLAME reliably bins together most reads of each chromosome from a metagenome.</p><p id="Par29">Initially, CLAME produces a graph with nodes (vertices) and edges, G&#x02009;=&#x02009;(V,E); while the reads are the nodes, the edges are the reads alignments. An edge between two reads is created only if they have an exact alignment of a large number of bases. Ideally, two reads from different DNA chromosomes will not align together, at least not in a considerable number of bases, and thus, the graph will represent the different organisms or chromosomes as organized subgraphs. The binning will thus follow naturally by traversing the graph, creating a bin for each connected subgraph. However, conserved regions, such as the ribosomal RNA genes, may generate edges between reads with different species memberships. CLAME considers the user-defined thresholds on the number of edges of a node when creating the bins. The user can define several thresholds to configure CLAME&#x02019;s sensibility to the abundance of the species present which depends on the characteristics of the experiment. A detailed CLAME methodology is illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and explained in the next subsections.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CLAME methodology. Stage 1) read alignment: the metagenome is composed by reads from different genomes (represented by the red and green colors); each read, represented by a single rectangle, is aligned against all the reads; an adjacency list shows all the alignments for each read. Stage 2) edges analysis: The graph representation indicates the relation of the reads; the reads that belong to a shared region can connect the subgroups (the green reads are connected to the green reads by the relation between read 1 and read 2); these connections usually make the number-of-edges histogram depart from a normal like form; then the histogram helps the user to set the number-of-edges thresholds on a range, in which a normal distribution is observed; It allows users to make bins with reads belonging to a normal-like connection profile. Stage 3) graph traversal and bin generation: the bins are generated by traveling the graph and reporting each subgraph (e.g. {1, 9, 6, 5, 8} green reads and {0, 3, 7, 4} red reads)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2018_5191_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Read alignment stage</title><p id="Par30">The read-overlap detection stage creates the edges of the graph. Algorithms like Needleman-Wush [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and Smith-Waterman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] were designed to find the optimal local alignment, the problem is that they have <italic>O(n</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup><italic>)</italic> computational times, where n is the number of bases of the reads. Thus, they are very slow for big datasets. To speed up alignment analysis, there are several algorithms that rely on a suffix/prefix tree representation of the dataset, such as suffix tree, enhanced suffix array or FM-index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. On these algorithms, all the reads are used to create a tree representation of them, and then, each read can be aligned to all others by searching it in the representation. In this case, the computational time can be reduced from <italic>O(n</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup><italic>)</italic> to <italic>O(m&#x02009;+&#x02009;n)</italic>, where m is the time to build the suffix tree, which is order n, and this way, the computational time can be reduced significantly.</p><p id="Par31">CLAME uses a custom version of the suffix tree method: the Succinct Data Structure Library 2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. With this library, we can find all the alignments of a query searching for a path in the tree. In the tree, descending from the root, each edge on the path matches a query. If there is a path for a query, it means that there is a substring and the reads in the path are the matches. To reduce computational time, CLAME only searches for exact alignments of <italic>b</italic> bases (forward and the reverse complement). The parameter &#x0201c;<italic>b&#x0201d;</italic> is the number-of-bases minimum-length alignment accepted, and it is set by the user. Using this information, CLAME creates the graph. It is represented as an adjacency list in which the first column represents the node and the second, the edges (the nodes that align in at least <italic>b</italic> bases). In an ideal case, the overlap stage must separate the graph, in sub-graphs, according to the number of chromosomes present in the metagenome. However, since there are sequencing errors and highly conserved genes, some reads can align in more than one species/chromosome, creating bins that include reads from more than one chromosome. To deal with this issue, CLAME uses edge analysis stage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Edge analysis stage</title><p id="Par32">We have observed that the number of edges of a node is related to the abundance of that sequence on the metagenome. Furthermore, they follow a normal-like histogram. Using the adjacency list, generated in the read alignment stage, CLAME reports the reads&#x02019; number-of edges histogram of each bin. The number-of-edges histogram helps the user to set the thresholds, since a normal distribution is expected for the reads of a same chromosome, then the user can look at the graph and set the thresholds accordingly, to deal with the following problems. 1) nodes with a number of edges several times larger than the mean: Our experiments show that they are mainly produced by conserved zones of the DNA that are similar in several species. 2) nodes with a number of edges much smaller than the mean: we have observed that they are produced mainly by chimeric reads. Both of these problems make that reads from different DNA chromosomes end up being related.</p><p id="Par33">Since the objective of CLAME is to create bins of reads from the single DNA chromosome, we allow the user to set thresholds on the number of edges. It allows users to eliminate reads with larger and smaller than the normal number of edges. CLAME takes users&#x02019; edge thresholds to redefine the graph and get connected subgraphs. The bins are generated by traveling the graph and reporting each subgraph.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Graph traversal and bin generation</title><p id="Par34">CLAME uses a greedy breadth-first search strategy to traverse the graph and to report each subgraph as a bin. It starts at an arbitrary node of a graph and explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next neighbors&#x02019; level. It takes into consideration the edge thresholds to decide if the node is added to the bin or further analyzed. The process ends when no more reads can be added to the bin. At this point all the reads visited are reported as members of the same bin and a new seed is taken. This is done until all reads have been added to a bin. At the end, the bins and their reads are reported on output fasta files. CLAME allows the user to define a minimum bin size (number of reads) to avoid report singletons or very small bins.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Simulated simple metagenome</title><p id="Par35">A synthetic metagenome dataset was created using 289,917 reads of <italic>Brucella canis</italic> and 375,122 reads of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis,</italic> both generated with the ROCHE&#x02019;s 454 titanium platform and associated with the NCBI&#x02019;s bioprojects PRJEB4803 and PRJEB8877, respectively.

Newbler had the best N50 statistic on a low number of contigs (with more than 500 bases), all of them with a peak depth greater than two.</p><p id="Par67">We took Newbler&#x02019;s contigs with more than 500 bases for further analyses; we explored them with the metagenomic annotation pipelines AMPHORA2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], MEGAN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and RAIphy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> summarizes the results. For all the tools, the Proteobacteria was the predominant phylum while Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi are present in lower abundance. RAIphy assigns all contigs on a single phylum, however, manual inspection showed a large number cases that contradict the other tools. For AMPHORA2 the unknown classification was the most frequent, leaving most of the contigs without any taxonomical assignation. This is expected since AMPHORA2 is focused on detecting 33 bacterial genes that are very useful for taxonomical purposes. MEGAN is the one that classifies more contigs (20%), however, the number of contigs annotated in each phylum was not enough to propose a draft genome.</p><p id="Par68">The original dataset, after cleaning, was binned using CLAME. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> shows the edge histogram, produced by CLAME, considering 70 bases alignment. It shows a normal-like distribution in the range of 30 to 130 edges. Consequently, we ran CLAME with these parameters. CLAME reported a total of 11 bins with at least 2000 reads.</p><p id="Par69">The biggest bin is composed by 380,846 reads (42.3% of the total of reads). Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref> summarizes the number of contigs and characteristics of the assembly of these reads using Newbler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], Ray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and MetaVelvet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> compares these results versus the original assembly without the binning step.

Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref> shows that most contigs were assigned to the <italic>Xanthomonadaceae</italic> family. We used these contigs to produce the Colombian thermophile <italic>Xanthomonadaceae_UdeA_SF1</italic> draft genome (available in CLAME&#x02019;s GitHub and on the NCBI&#x02019;s project PRJNA431299).</p><p id="Par71">Table <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref> summarizes, CheckM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], Prodigal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and Genmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] tools report. On the contigs assembled from the biggest bin, there are more than 2600 open reading frames (ORFs) that codify as possible genes, and since there are 3.0 Mbp on the genome, it indicates that there is close to 1 coding region per Kbp.</p><p id="Par72">An additional quality control was done using MEGAN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] to assign each ORFs into a taxonomic level. As it is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>, for the first 11 largest contigs, most of the ORFs were annotated as Proteobacteria (blue bars in the graph). Moreover, we measured the assembly completeness in terms of gene content by means of Universal Single-Copy Orthologs using BUSCO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] tool. We found 32 of the 40 (80%) essential genes reported by BUSCO were found in the proposed draft genome. Using the set of standards for the minimum information regarding a metagenome-assembled genome (MIMAG) proposed by Bowers et al.

The top 7 of the BLASTn results are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table">9</xref>. To refine the query, we reconstructed the 16S phylogeny using the Ribosomal Data Project database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] as a curated reference, the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Jukes-Cantor model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] and the Brumm et al.

According to cell localization prediction, most of the proteins were assigned to the intracellular space, while others were localized to different components such as cell membrane, periplasmic space, and macromolecular complexes. The Molecular function prediction shows, at the top, the category organic substance biosynthetic process, followed by anion and cation binding. Nevertheless, other categories like hydrolases, transferases, transporters, peptidases, ligases, and lyases were well represented. For the biological process annotation, 26 terms were assigned for 2581 hits, being organic substance biosynthetic process at the top of the list with 217 hits. Also above 200 hits were, in order of abundance, cellular biosynthetic process, organic cyclic compound metabolic process, heterocycle metabolic process and cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process.</p><p id="Par76">Moreover, using the KEGG pathway annotation tool KAAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] we were able to confirm that the glycolysis, pentose phosphate, Glyoxylate, Fatty acid biosynthesis, beta-Oxidation and TCA cycle enzymes were all present and complete. For the genetic information processing complexes, RNApol beta subunits, as well as alpha and omega, were annotated, but the delta was missed in our putative protein set. In the case of DNA replication, bacterial subunits of the holoenzyme pol III were detected except for the psi and theta subunits. Helicase, primase, SSB, DNA ligase and RNAses HI, and HII were also annotated by KAAS. Within the homologous recombination system, RecA and RecJ proteins were also missed by the annotator. Two-component systems were also annotated; the family OmpR was the most frequent with the histidine kinases PhoR, PhoQ, CreC, CusS, and ArcB. The second most frequent was the NarL family with orthologous for the kinases BarA, DesK, and VraS.</p><p id="Par77">CLAME binning for the hot spring metagenome was compared with the results of MetaBingG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], MetaProb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], BiMeta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and AbundanceBin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

We included the same fields for the de-novo assembly of CLAME&#x02019;s biggest bin. It produced fewer contigs than the assembly of the others tools-results. Moreover, the genome size estimation is the closest to the expected bacteria genome-size.</p><p id="Par78">The additional bins (with at least 2000 reads) produced by CLAME were assembled using Newbler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and annotated with AMPHORA2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], MEGAN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and RAIphy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. AMPHORA2 doesn&#x02019;t report hits because no marker can be found in these reads. MEGAN and RAIphy results indicate that the reads can be an additional part of the Proteobacteria.</p><p id="Par79">Finally, removing the reads used for the draft genome, a total of 519,524 reads were left. Experimentally, we noted that using 15 bases alignment, produce a big bin with mainly a single species. The edges-histogram is illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17</xref>, and it shows that in the range 10 to 20 edges there is a second normal-like histogram. Configuring CLAME with this thresholds, it produces a bin with 146,967 reads. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab11" ref-type="table">11</xref> illustrates that the de-novo assembly for these reads, using Newbler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], produces 5056 contigs.

Probably the main reason is that it is not a simple task. However, in many projects, the researchers are not interested in getting a genome but just testing the presence of different species. It has been known that a binning step is desired on metagenome studies. In this work, we show that CLAME can bin reads fast and efficiently. By being very strict, allowing only long and perfect alignments, and given the user thresholds, CLAME creates bins of reads from a single DNA chromosome. Furthermore, most reads are assigned to a bin despite using a very restricted alignment. We showed that the other binning tools were not very effective classifying the metagenome reads that we were analyzing. CLAME allowed us to extract most reads of a novel <italic>Xanthomonadaceae</italic> bacterium from a hot spring metagenome on a single bin. We validate the draft genome using several tools.</p><p id="Par82">Given its speed and performance, we present CLAME as a metagenome-binning tool. CLAME works best for bacterium genomes that are well covered on the metagenome and it mainly extracts the most abundant species. For closely related species in a metagenome, but with a significant difference in concentration, the user can adjust thresholds to bin them in different groups.</p><p id="Par83">In metagenomes with highly represented complex species, like in the eukaryote <italic>C. hominis</italic> example, CLAME created bins with mainly single species reads, but it generated too many bins. Due to the complexity of the <italic>C. hominis</italic> genome, the authors of the original paper used reads from two platforms (with different characteristics) to assemble it. We show that CLAME can recover reads that cover most of the protozoan parasite genome. CLAME can be used to quickly create bins of reads that can be further assembled, reducing the processing time, the risk of chimeric contigs and obtain better N50 stats.</p><p id="Par84">Given the complexity of metagenomes, the different sequencing methodologies, and the variable error rates of the sequencing, it is difficult that a tool automatically creates the bins. For this reason, in CLAME we added several configuration parameters that allow the user to tune it for the particular experiment. We used CLAME to bin the reads of the most abundant species of metagenome from a hot spring.</p><p id="Par85">The assembly of the biggest CLAME bin generated the draft genome presented. According to the 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic analysis, it corresponds to a novel taxon within the Order <italic>Xanthomonadales</italic>. Although the closest related sequences within the Ribosomal Database Project are uncultured bacteria, the phylogenetic reconstruction, including only isolated-type strains, clearly shows that our genome is within the family <italic>Xanthomonadaceae</italic>, close to <italic>Dokdonella spp</italic>. but separated from the family <italic>Sinobacteriacea</italic> (i.e. outgroup <italic>Alkanibacter difficilis</italic>). We propose it as a partial draft genome of novel thermophile <italic>Xanthomonadal</italic>.</p><p id="Par86">The de-novo assembled genome is around 3&#x000a0;Mb, with 2726 predicted ORFs; it is a small genome size compared to <italic>Dokdonella</italic> and <italic>Dyella</italic>, both with genomes around 4.5&#x000a0;Mb and 3519 and 3966 annotated proteins, respectively. Our BUSCO annotation results show that the genome is not complete, 32 genes of 40 essential were found. The KEGG annotation pipeline further confirmed this, since the subunits RNApol and DNApol were not completely present in our annotated contigs. However, the main metabolic pathways such as TCA, glycolysis, pentose phosphate, Glyoxylate, Fatty acid biosynthesis and beta-Oxidation were present and they were completely annotated by the same database. In addition, proteins from all different cell localizations were annotated. BUSCO estimation of 80% completeness of the genome might be adequate as a reference lower limit, although we cannot predict if the genome size of the novel Andean <italic>Xanthomonadaceae</italic> is as big as the <italic>Dyella</italic> and <italic>Dokdonella</italic> genomes.</p><p id="Par87">The global genome annotation did not show any special adaptations of this prokaryote; its metabolic profile is very similar to the other organism of this Family, where we can find a Heterotrophic lifestyle living at expenses of the Cyanobacteria that shared the thermal water.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par88">While several metagenomic binning tools were unable to separate the synthetic and real problems that we proposed, we show that CLAME was faster and better on these problems. CLAME is a tool that helps researchers to analyze metagenomes by creating bins of reads that belong to a single DNA chromosome, without the need of a reference genome. This is important since most of the unculturable microorganisms do not have reference genomes. Therefore, it can be used to improve metagenome analysis by grouping reads from DNA fragments of novel species, such as the <italic>Xanthomonadal</italic> presented in this work. This draft genome is one of the first thermophile members of this family, and it was possible to obtain thanks to CLAME.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>
