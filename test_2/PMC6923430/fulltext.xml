Unfortunately, most existing methods for genome-wide genotype&#x02013;phenotype mapping are limited to a single mode of genomic alteration, i.e. overexpression, repression, or deletion. Here we report a multi-functional genome-wide CRISPR (MAGIC) system to precisely control the expression level of defined genes to desired levels throughout the whole genome. By combining the tri-functional CRISPR system and array-synthesized oligo pools, MAGIC is used to create, to the best of our knowledge, one of the most comprehensive and diversified genomic libraries in yeast ever reported. The power of MAGIC is demonstrated by the identification of previously uncharacterized genetic determinants of complex phenotypes, particularly those having synergistic interactions when perturbed to different expression levels. MAGIC represents a powerful synthetic biology tool to investigate fundamental biological questions as well as engineer complex phenotypes for biotechnological applications.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Genome-scale engineering is generally limited to single methods of alteration such as overexpression, repression or deletion.

Nevertheless, our understanding of the complexity of the cellular network is rather limited. For example, only about 1000 genes are included in the most advanced genome-scale metabolic models of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, although there are more than 6000 genes in the genome of this most well-studied eukaryote<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In other words, most genes have not been clearly mapped into biological pathways or phenotypic traits. Therefore, the identification of genetic determinants and the elucidation of their synergistic interactions remain the biggest challenges for understanding and engineering complex phenotypes.</p><p id="Par4">Genome-scale engineering that can create libraries of genetic variants covering all the possible genes provides a promising strategy for functional genomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, overcoming our limited knowledge of biocomplexity. Recently, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) system has revolutionized the genome engineering field and was recently adopted for genome-scale engineering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. By introducing pooled or arrayed guide RNA (gRNA) libraries that can target all the genes of a specific organism, CRISPR has enabled the construction of genome-wide deletion (CRISPRd) libraries in bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, yeasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and mammalian cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Moreover, by using the nuclease-deficient CRISPR protein (dCas), genome-scale transcriptional activation (CRISPRa)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and interference (CRISPRi)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> have been demonstrated in various hosts as well. Nevertheless, there is still no report on the development of a multi-functional genome-scale CRISPR system, and the genetic determinants were identified using a single type of modulation (activation, interference, or deletion). Recently, the guidelines for genome-scale CRISPR knockout and activation screening were provided independently. However, due to the use of the same Cas protein to create&#x000a0;both libraries, interactions between the deletion and activation targets could not be explored<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In other words, the genotypic diversity created by existing methods is not comprehensive, as both upregulation and downregulation of multiple targets are generally required to engineer the desired phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. For example, overexpression of the mevalonate pathway and repression of the downstream ergosterol biosynthetic pathway worked synergistically for the carotenogenesis phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Considering the demands for genetic manipulation of multiple targets with different modes of alteration and the availability of CRISPR modules, there is a growing interest in the development of multi-functional CRISPR systems for both fundamental studies and biotechnological applications. The first dual-functional CRISPR system was developed by the scaffold RNA (scRNA) strategy, where aptamer sequences (i.e. MS2) were fused to the gRNA scaffold to recruit transcriptional regulators to dCas9 via aptamer&#x02013;RNA-binding protein interactions. The specific interaction between aptamer and RNA-binding protein enabled CRISPRa and CRISPRi to work independently in the same cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Simultaneous gene deletion and transcriptional activation was achieved using Cas-activator fusion proteins via gRNA engineering, truncated gRNAs for CRISPRa and full-length gRNAs for CRISPRd<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. By taking advantage of the binding position effect, a dCas9-based activator was repurposed to function as a dual-mode activator/repressor, which could block transcription initiation and elongation when targeting the core promoter and coding sequence regions (CRISPRi) and served as a transcriptional activator when targeting the upstream sequences of the core promoter (CRISPRa)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In our previous studies, we developed a tri-functional CRISPR system (CRISPR-AID) using three orthogonal Cas proteins to integrate gene activation, interference, and deletion into the same host. In the CRISPR-AID system, the catalytically inactive Cas12a from <italic>Lachnospiraceae bacterium</italic> fused with an activation domain (dLbCas12a-VP) was used for CRISPRa, the nuclease-deficient Cas9 from <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> fused with a repression domain (dSpCas9-RD1152) for CRISPRi, and the catalytic Cas9 from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (SaCas9) for CRISPRd<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Notably, none of these multi-functional CRISPR systems has been attempted at the whole genome scale, limiting their wide applications in high throughout functional genomics and complex phenotype engineering.</p><p id="Par6">In the present study, we develop a multi-functional genome-wide CRISPR (MAGIC) system for high throughput genotype&#x02013;phenotype mapping. By combining CRISPR-AID and array-synthesized oligo pools, we create genome-scale gain-of-function, reduction-of-function, and loss-of-function libraries, which represents, to the best of our knowledge, one of the most comprehensive and diversified genomic libraries ever reported in yeast. MAGIC is then used to identify previously uncharacterized genetic determinants of complex phenotypes, i.e. furfural tolerance and protein surface display, either iteratively (iMAGIC) or simultaneously (sMAGIC). Finally, we explore the synergistic interactions among MAGIC-identified targets when regulated to different expression levels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design of MAGIC for high throughput functional genomics</title><p id="Par7">In our previous study, we have constructed the CRISPR-AID system. This multi-functional genome engineering technology enabled the combinatorial optimization of many pre-defined targets for the construction of optimal yeast cell factories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. To further develop the MAGIC system, we designed and constructed three genome-scale gRNA-expressing plasmid libraries from pools of array-synthesized oligos, each for upregulating, downregulating, and deleting all the genes in the yeast genome, respectively. Transforming the plasmid libraries into the CRISPR-AID-integrated <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> resulted in the construction of the MAGIC library (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), where a full spectrum of expression profiles were achieved for all defined genes throughout the whole genome. The MAGIC library, which represents one of the most comprehensive and diversified genomic libraries ever reported in yeast, was grown with or without a certain stress or subject to high throughput screening to associate our target phenotypes with their strongest genetic determinants in the yeast genome. The unique guide sequence in each plasmid serves as a genetic barcode for high throughput phenotyping by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Genotype&#x02013;phenotype relationships can be mapped by tracking the enrichment or depletion of guide sequences, and the synergistic or additive interactions among gain-of-function, reduction-of-function, and loss-of-function mutations can be identified in an iterative and genome-wide manner.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>The MAGIC pipeline for genome-wide mapping genotype&#x02013;phenotype relationships.</title><p>Guide sequences for genome-scale activation (orange), interference (light blue), and deletion (magenta) were synthesized as arrayed oligos on DNA chip and cloned into the corresponding gRNA expression plasmids using Golden-Gate Assembly.

The enrichment and depletion of guide sequences were profiled using next-generation sequencing.

Previously reported integration loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> were chosen, which were flanked by highly expressed essential genes to enable efficient and stable expression of heterologous genes and pathways. Ten gRNA plasmids based on SaCas9 were constructed to integrate heterologous cassettes into X2, X3, X4, XI1, XI2, XI3, XII1, XII2, XII4, and XII5 loci, respectively (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The gRNA-targeting efficiency was tested by transforming the gRNA plasmid without any donor to repair the double strand break: efficient gRNAs should result in no surviving colonies. The integration efficiency and gRNA expression levels were evaluated by co-transforming the reporter strain (bAID-RV) with the gRNA plasmid, as well as its corresponding linear donor fragment, which contained a gRNA expression cassette to activate the expression of mCherry or to repress the expression of mVenus. Eight colonies were randomly picked to measure the change in fluorescence intensities.

To enable genome-scale gene disruption, the homologous recombination donor was integrated to the 5&#x02032;-end of the targeting sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Homology-directed repair resulted in the deletion of 28&#x02009;bp nucleotides in the coding sequences, including both the targeting sequences and the protospacer adjacent motif sequences (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Different from CRISPRd, the gRNA-binding sites relative to the transcriptional starting sites can be equally important as the guide sequences for CRISPRa and CRISPRi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, the following criteria were included to rank the guide sequences: targeting efficiency, targeting position, GC content, and off-target score. The guide sequences containing polyT, polyG, and <italic>Bsa</italic>I sites were excluded. In addition, to make the genome-scale libraries more diversified, we only kept the top-ranked guide if multiple guide sequences were clustered together. We validated the ranking criteria using the previously designed gRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> with high efficiency (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). For most of the targets, we selected six top-ranked guide sequences for the CRISPRa and CRISPRi libraries, while four for the CRISPRd library. On average, ~98% of the designed gRNAs showed high scores (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). We also included 100 randomly generated guide sequences as negative controls in each library. Adapters were added to both ends of these oligos for cloning purposes (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). In summary, we designed and synthesized 37,817, 37,870, and 24,806 unique guide sequences for the CRISPRa, CRISPRi, and CRISPRd libraries, respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>).

The Golden-Gate Assembly efficiency was estimated to be nearly 100% by randomly genotyping 14 clones for each library. We sequenced the plasmid libraries and found that ~87% of the CRISPRa and CRISPRi libraries and ~73% of the CRISPRd libraries had the correct guide sequences. The lower mapping ratio of the CRISPRd library should result from higher synthesis error rate for longer oligos. As a result, more than 99.9% of all gRNAs and genes were covered in the CRISPRa and CRISPRi plasmid libraries, while there was at least one gRNA for ~98% of the yeast genes in the CRISPRd library (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The coverage of the genome-scale CRISPR-AID libraries was significantly higher than the previously reported cDNA-based genome-scale libraries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. We then created the iMAGIC library by transforming the three genome-scale plasmid libraries into the CRISPR-AID strains. The diversity of the iMAGIC library was evaluated by randomly genotyping 50 colonies of the CRISPRa yeast library (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Validation of iMAGIC for engineering complex phenotypes</title><p id="Par11">Next, we sought to use iMAGIC to identify genetic determinants of complex phenotypes, such as furfural tolerance and protein surface display. We screened the iMAGIC library in the presence of 5&#x02009;mM furfural and observed many enriched guide sequences as compared to that under the reference conditions. Notably, the control guide sequences were not enriched, indicating the association of the enriched guide sequences with furfural stress (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Among those highly enriched guides, <italic>SIZ1i</italic> (referring to <italic>SIZ1</italic> interference and the same afterwards) and <italic>SAP30d</italic> have been reported as furfural tolerance-related targets via genome-wide CRISPRd screening in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, while <italic>SLX5i</italic>, <italic>NUP133i</italic>, <italic>GPI17i</italic>, and <italic>UME1i</italic> were only identified in the present study (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).

The diversity of the sMAGIC library was evaluated by randomly genotyping 40 clones (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Due to the length of the double-gRNA cassettes, instead of growth enrichment followed by NGS, the sMAGIC yeast library strains were directly spread to the selective agar plates containing 10&#x02009;mM furfural. Via genotyping of the largest colonies, we obtained a few previously unidentified combinations conferring furfural tolerance comparable to that of the second round iMAGIC-screened mutant (<italic>SIZ1i</italic>-<italic>NAT1a</italic>), including <italic>SFH1a</italic>-<italic>UBC9i</italic>, <italic>SIZ1d</italic>-<italic>SPC29i</italic>, and <italic>SLX5i</italic>-<italic>SDS3i</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b, c</xref>).

Although there are prior CRISPR-enabled genome-scale&#x000a0;engineering attempts, the genotypic diversity is only limited to the targets that share the same type of genomic alteration. To address this limitation, we developed MAGIC for mapping synergistic or additive interactions among overexpression, repression, and deletion targets in a genome-wide manner in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Taking the furfural-tolerant phenotype for example, the genome-wide RNAi technology (RAGE) failed to identify additional targets after one round screening with 5&#x02009;mM furfural<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and another genome-scale CRISPRd system (CHAnGE) could not obtain enriched targets after two rounds of screening at 10&#x02009;mM furfural<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, while iMAGIC continued to enrich additional genetic determinants even after third rounds of screening at 15&#x02009;mM furfural. Although screened under the same conditions (10&#x02009;mM furfural and two rounds of evolution), the iMAGIC-engineered strain (<italic>SIZ1i</italic>-<italic>NAT1a</italic>) performed much better than the CHAnGE-modified strain (<italic>SIZ1d</italic>-<italic>LCB3d</italic>) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). In other words, MAGIC not only identified more genetic determinants of furfural tolerance, but also engineered more furfural tolerant strains. Rational metabolic engineering strategies have also been employed to engineer furfural tolerance and the best performance in a laboratory yeast strain was achieved by overexpression of <italic>TPS1</italic> and <italic>ARI1</italic>, as well as the deletion of <italic>NTH1</italic> (<italic>TPS1a-ARI1a</italic>-<italic>NTH1d</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.

These results demonstrated the necessity of combinatorial optimization and the power of MAGIC.</p><p id="Par18">Recently, cDNA overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi) was combined to achieve combinatorial genome-scale engineering of complex phenotypes in yeast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Both strategies enable the exploration of the gain-of-function and reduction-of-function combinations that work synergistically or additively to improve the desired phenotypes. Nevertheless, MAGIC not only introduces a third mode of genome engineering (gene deletion), but also offers several advantages of the CRISPR system. For example, MAGIC is less biased than the cDNA library, as all the MAGIC cassettes have the same or similar size to minimize cloning and transformation bias. More importantly, MAGIC represents one of the most comprehensive libraries ever created, with an average of&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;99% coverage of all ORFs and RNA genes for genome-wide overexpression, repression, and deletion (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In comparison, the cDNA-based library covers ~92% of all ORFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, as not all genes will be expressed under a given condition and RNA genes will not be included. In addition, the regulatory mechanisms are different, CRISPRi blocks transcription in the nucleus while RNAi affects mRNA stability and translation in the cytosol, and CRISPRi is generally believed to demonstrate higher gene repression efficiency than RNAi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par19">The synergistic interactions among gain-of-function, reduction-of-function, and loss-of-function targets were identified either iteratively (iMAGIC) or simultaneously (sMAGIC). While iMAGIC has the advantages of high library coverage for functional genomics, its major limitation lies in the fact that only one perturbation (either activation, interference, or deletion) was made in each round. On the contrary, sMAGIC was established to identify synergistic interactions simultaneously, with two perturbations made to each strain as demonstrated in the present study. Theoretically, the sMAGIC library covered all the possible genomic perturbation combinations of LibA&#x02013;LibA, LibA&#x02013;LibI, LibA&#x02013;LibD, LibI&#x02013;LibI, LibI&#x02013;LibD, and LibD&#x02013;LibD. However, due to the limitations in transformation efficiency (~10<sup>6</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>7</sup> for yeast transformation), only ~0.01% to ~0.1% of the total combinations (~10<sup>5</sup>&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10<sup>10</sup>) were covered in the sMAGIC yeast library. The low library coverage might explain the failure to obtain any better gRNA combinations enabling higher furfural tolerance than the second round iMAGIC mutant (<italic>SIZ1i</italic>-<italic>NAT1a</italic>). Nevertheless, we could identify the combinations with synergistic interactions beyond the reach of iMAGIC. For example, neither <italic>SFH1a</italic> nor <italic>UBC9i</italic> were found to be highly enriched in the iMAGIC screening and we would never be able to identify the <italic>SFH1a</italic>&#x02013;<italic>UBC9i</italic> combination in improving furfural tolerance using iMAGIC. In addition, we obtained several mutant strains with similar performance as the <italic>SIZ1i</italic>-<italic>NAT1a</italic> strain (R2) in a single round of screening, indicating sMAGIC as a powerful and yet time-saving tool for strain engineering. Due to the extremely low coverage, sMAGIC is not suitable for functional genomics and high throughput genotype&#x02013;phenotype mapping. Overall, iMAGIC is more suitable for functional genomic studies, while sMAGIC has advantages in practical applications in strain engineering.</p><p id="Par20">It is possible that MAGIC can be adopted for genome-scale engineering of higher eukaryotic organisms.

However, high transformation efficiency, decent genome- editing efficiency, as well as the availability of a high throughput screening method are the prerequisites for applying MAGIC for functional genomic studies. Accompanied with the advantages of genome-scale engineering is the challenge in phenotyping large strain libraries containing millions and even billions of variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.
