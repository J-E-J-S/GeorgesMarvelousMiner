    "The molecular mechanism of antenatal hypoxia impacting on fetal heart development and elevated risk of heart disease of adult offspring is poorly understood. We present a dataset integrating DNA methylome and transcriptome analyses of antenatal hypoxia affecting rat fetal and adult offspring hearts to understand hypoxia-mediated epigenomic reprogramming of the heart development. We showed that antenatal hypoxia not only induced DNA methylomic and transcriptomic changes in the fetal hearts, but also had a delayed and lasting effect on the adult offspring hearts. Of interest, antenatal hypoxia induced opposite changes in DNA methylation patterns in fetal and adult hearts, with a hypermethylation in the fetus and a hypomethylation in the adult. An extensive preprocessing, quality assessment, and downstream data analyses were performed on the genomic dataset so that the research community may take advantage of the public resource. These dataset could be exploited as a comprehensive resource for understanding fetal hypoxia-mediated epigenetic reprogramming in the heart development and further developmental programming of heart vulnerability to disease later in life.Figshare doi: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.9948572."
