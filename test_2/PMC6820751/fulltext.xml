We present a dataset integrating DNA methylome and transcriptome analyses of antenatal hypoxia affecting rat fetal and adult offspring hearts to understand hypoxia-mediated epigenomic reprogramming of the heart development. We showed that antenatal hypoxia not only induced DNA methylomic and transcriptomic changes in the fetal hearts, but also had a delayed and lasting effect on the adult offspring hearts. Of interest, antenatal hypoxia induced opposite changes in DNA methylation patterns in fetal and adult hearts, with a hypermethylation in the fetus and a hypomethylation in the adult. An extensive preprocessing, quality assessment, and downstream data analyses were performed on the genomic dataset so that the research community may take advantage of the public resource. These dataset could be exploited as a comprehensive resource for understanding fetal hypoxia-mediated epigenetic reprogramming in the heart development and further developmental programming of heart vulnerability to disease later in life.</p><p id="Par2"><bold>Figshare doi</bold>: 10.6084/m9.figshare.9948572</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="summary"><p id="Par3">

Yet the molecular mechanisms remain largely elusive. In addition to other risk factors, large epidemiological and animal studies have shown a clear association of adverse intrauterine environment with increased risk of ischemic heart disease in adulthood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Hypoxia is a common form of intrauterine stress, and the fetus may experience prolonged hypoxic stress under a variety of conditions, including pregnancy at high altitude, pregnancy with anemia, placental insufficiency, cord compression, preeclampsia, heart, lung and kidney disease, or with hemoglobinopathy. Previous studies have suggested a possible link between antenatal hypoxia and increased risk of cardiovascular disease in offspring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Studies in rats have demonstrated that maternal hypoxia results in heightened cardiac vulnerability to ischemia and reperfusion injury in offspring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. DNA methylation is a key mechanism associated with human diseases, altered gene expression and phenotype. Emerging evidence suggests that DNA methylation may play a crucial role in gestational hypoxia-induced developmental reprogramming. Consistent with what we reported recently in animal model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, there were other studies also showing that a chronic hypoxia induced DNA methylation alteration and/or transcriptomic reprogramming in cardiomyocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Our previous studies showed that hypermethylation of single gene (e.g., PKC) was involved in antenatal hypoxia-induced developmental plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, the impact of fetal hypoxia on the alteration of global methylation pattern and transcriptomic changes in the heart development remain unclear.</p><p id="Par6">Recently, we presented an integration analysis to utilize reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) DNA methylome analysis coupled with RNA-seq to test the hypothesis that antenatal hypoxia causes a global epigenomic reprogramming and a corresponding transcriptomic alteration in developmental programming of hypoxic/ischaemic-sensitive phenotype in the heart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The study showed that antenatal hypoxia not only induced a global DNA methylomic and transcriptomic changes in the fetal hearts, but also had a delayed and lasting effect on the heart in adult offspring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In summary, our DNA methylome analyses identified 2,828 (1,824 hyper- vs. 1,004 hypo-) differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in fetal hearts and 2,193 (647 hyper- vs. 1,546 hypo-) DMRs in adult male hearts between hypoxia exposure and control. The differential methylation analysis showed an inverse hyper-hypo proportion relationship between fetal and adult male hearts. Consistent with the differential methylation analysis, an opposite global DNA methylation pattern caused by antenatal hypoxia was observed between fetal and adult hearts when examining the transcript starting site regions (TSS&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3&#x02009;k) and CpG islands (CGIs) in all genes, which displayed a hypermethylation in the fetal hearts and a hypomethylation in the adult hearts. Our transcriptome analysis identified a total of 323 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in fetal hearts and 112 DEGs in adult male hearts between prenatal hypoxia exposure and control. More up-regulated DEGs were identified in fetal (62.2%), compared to adult male rats (37.5%). Our pathway analysis based on the DEGs showed a significant difference between fetal and adult male rats. In fetal hearts, developmental/stress response related pathways were enriched, whereas in adult male rat hearts, immune/inflammatory response related pathways were enriched. Our integration analysis on DNA methylome and transcriptome data revealed a strong negative correlation between TSS CpG methylation and gene expression using the pooled data from both fetal and adult hearts. Furthermore, there was a strong negative correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression level when DMRs were located in promoter or exon regions of genes. We would like to note that our dataset including both DNA methylome and RNAs-seq transcriptome in a rat model involving prenatal hypoxia exposure is very unique and rare in the community which will have a great value and reusability. The dataset is in a high quality. More biological insights can be derived with further data mining performed by different investigators. Particularly, our dataset has special value to the those studying the maternal exposure induced epigenomic and transcriptomic reprogramming in the fetus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par7">We have presented some these methods in our primary publication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

The fragments were directly subject to end blunting and phosphorylation. A single nucleotide (A) was then added to the 3&#x02032; ends of the fragments in preparation for ligation to a methylated adapter with a single-base T overhang. The ligation products were final repaired in a thermal cycler under the program (60&#x02009;&#x000b0;C &#x02013; 10&#x02009;min, 70&#x02009;&#x000b0;C &#x02013; 10&#x02009;min, hold at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C).

All RNA samples (except non-template control) were spiked with 1:500 ERCC RNA spike-in control mix (Life Technologies). Before cDNA generation, samples were treated with a second round of DNase for more thorough removal of gDNA following NuGEN&#x02019;s integrated DNase treatment protocol. Double-stranded cDNA was generated using ~100&#x02009;ng of total RNA per sample. cDNA was sheared using the Covaris S220 sonication system. Each sample was sheared according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s settings of 130&#x02009;&#x000b5;L sample with a target (peak) of 200&#x02009;bp. The settings were as follows: 10% duty factor and 200 cycles/burst at 7&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 180&#x02009;seconds. End repair was then performed to generate blunt ends for adaptor ligation. Unique barcodes were used for each sample for multiplexing. Targeted rRNA-depletion was performed before final library construction. cDNA libraries were amplified using 15 cycles (Artik thermal cycler from Thermo Scientific) and purified using RNAClean XP beads (Agencourt, Brea, USA).

In fact, they showed almost the same patterns across all 76 bases.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Quality metrics of raw and aligned reads.

Furthermore, we examined the methylation regions located in the gene promoter regions (transcription start site/TSS&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;500&#x02009;bp) and we found that there were similar variances across samples within either hypoxia or control groups in adult male rat hearts (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Reproducibility of biological replicates in RRBS and RNA-seq data sets.

Our data sets will allow further analysis to gain a better understanding on the mechanism of hypoxia-induced epigenomic and transcriptomic reprograming and the corresponding impact in the heart development in a sex-dependent manner. Detailed understanding of antenatal hypoxia effect on heart development is of critical importance from both basic and clinical science points of view. The identification of hypoxia-mediated DNA methylation and gene expression biomarkers may provide new insights into potential therapeutic interventions to prevent and treat heart disease associated with fetal stress.</p><p id="Par25">In our original paper, we used classic tuxedo pipeline to process the RNA-seq data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.
