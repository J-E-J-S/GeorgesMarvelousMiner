    "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) still remains a higher mortality rate in worldwide. Obtaining promising biomakers is very crucial for improving the diagnosis and prognosis of ccRCC patients. Herein, we firstly identified eight potentially prognostic miRNAs (hsa-miR-144-5p, hsa-miR-223-3p, hsa-miR-365b-3p, hsa-miR-3613-5p, hsa-miR-9-5p, hsa-miR-183-5p, hsa-miR-335-3p, hsa-miR-1269a). Secondly, we found that a signature containing these eight miRNAs showed obviously superior to a single miRNA in the prognostic effect and credibility for predicting the survival of ccRCC patients. Thirdly, we discovered that twenty-two transcription factors (TFs) interact with these eight miRNAs, and a signature combining nine TFs (TFAP2A, KLF5, IRF1, RUNX1, RARA, GATA3, IKZF1, POU2F2, and FOXM1) could promote the prognosis of ccRCC patients. Finally, we further identified eleven genes (hsa-miR-365b-3p, hsa-miR-223-3p, hsa-miR-1269a, hsa-miR-144-5p, hsa-miR-183-5p, hsa-miR-335-3p, TFAP2A, KLF5, IRF1, MYC, IKZF1) that could combine as a signature to improve the prognosis effect of ccRCC patients, which distinctly outperformed the eight-miRNA signature and the nine-TF signature. Overall, we identified several new prognosis factors for ccRCC, and revealed a potential mechanism that TFs and miRNAs interplay cooperatively or oppositely regulate a certain number of tumor suppressors, driver genes, and oncogenes to facilitate the survival of ccRCC patients."
