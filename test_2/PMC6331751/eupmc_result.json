    "Aim:To produce synthetic nucleotides of notifiable dengue virus (1-4 types), Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever and Zika flaviviruses. These notifiable flaviviruses, particularly dengue and Zika, are problematic mosquito-borne infections in the Philippines, as well as in those countries with tropical and subtropical climates. Method:An algorithmic design formulation of overlap extension - polymerase chain reaction (OE-PCR) was performed to propagate 50-60 oligomer lengths of select notifiable flaviviral RNAs to DNA nucleotides via the two-step process of OE-PCR. Result:Algorithmic OE-PCR design formulation efficiently produced 253-256 bp of notifiable flaviviruses. Comparing the newly designed algorithmic OE-PCR with existing executable programs demonstrated it to be efficient and useful in generating accurate sequences of synthetic flaviviral nucleotides. Conclusion:The efficiently and accurately produced novel synthetic nucleotides of notifiable dengue virus 1-4, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever and Zika flaviviruses using OE-PCR is useful in understanding the dynamics of flaviviral species and holds potential for the development of synthetic nucleotide-based immunogens."
