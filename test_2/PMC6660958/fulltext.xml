Recent advances in tumor sequencing and identification of key driver genes has allowed the development of more targeted treatment strategies by leveraging individual patient genetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, the druggability of these targets becomes challenging if these genes are not expressed or are down-regulated in cancers.</p><p id="Par10">Synthetic lethality takes advantage of functional genetic interactions between gene pairs to develop targeted therapies and are beginning to be appreciated as a method of choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Inhibiting the synthetic lethal (SL) partner with a therapeutic drug selectively eliminates cancer cells leaving normal cells unaffected. Through the exploitation of these interactions, we can maximize the efficiency of personalized treatment and, ultimately, minimize the side effects that a patient experiences as a result of the therapeutic drug. Although the advent of genome-wide <italic>sh</italic>RNA and CRISPR screens have provided the specificity needed to perform the comprehensive epistasis mapping on any number of chosen gene pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], experimentally testing all possible gene pairs across multiple cell types to identify SL interactions (SLIs) is laborious and time-consuming. As early as 1997 Hartwell et al. hypothesized the existence of conserved SLIs identified initially in yeast that could be used for therapeutic intervention in human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Subsequently, yeast genetic interaction data has been used to identify SLIs in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These yeast-directed approaches have helped us to uncover several interactions in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For example, McManus et al. generated the first humanized SLIs of <italic>RAD54B</italic>-deficient human colorectal cancer cells by specifically translating the corresponding yeast interactions to human cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Thus, rather than translating all the yeast interactions to human, contextualizing these interactions provided valuable insights.</p><p id="Par11">Here we describe a patient-data driven approach where conserved SLIs of genes whose expression is lost in tumors alone are examined. Harnessing the vast available knowledge of yeast genetics and using yeast-human ortholog mapping, we generate a Humanized Yeast Genetic Interaction Network (HYGIN) that has the potential to identify novel cancer-specific SLIs and ultimately novel treatment strategies. This network is then integrated with patient data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cancer.gov/tcga/">https://www.cancer.gov/tcga/</ext-link>) to identify genes that are down-regulated in breast cancer and provide a breast cancer-focused version of HYGIN. From this work, we predict novel SLIs that can be exploited for patient-specific cancer therapeutics. Some of these involve FBXW7, a well-known tumor suppressor.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Generating the humanized genetic interaction network</title><p id="Par12">In order to generate HYGIN, experimentally validated yeast interactions from the May 2016 release of The Cell Map [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] were used. The yeast network contains quantitative genetic interactions for all gene pairs in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and is the result of double mutant arrays conducted in yeast that represent all of the SL interactions in the yeast genome. The yeast interaction data contains ~&#x02009;550,000 negative genetic interactions (SL interactions) between ~&#x02009;90% of the genes in the yeast genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In order to generate a humanized network, the yeast network was translated in three stages: yeast gene name to yeast protein, yeast protein to human orthologous protein, and finally human protein to human gene name. The UniProt database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] was used for the first two stages and InParanoid Version 8.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], an online tool for identifying orthologs between two species, was used to identify the human orthologs to the yeast proteins in stage three. Strict one-to-one mapping with InParanoid was used for the network to prevent ambiguities in the translation process (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1). The humanized gene interaction network and subnetworks were generated through a combination of bash (UNIX shell) and Python scripts, and imported into Cytoscape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] for visualization and analysis. The resulting network has 1009 nodes (human genes) and 10,419 edges (proposed SL interactions between human genes).

Gene expression data for cancerous and breast normal tissue in the same patient was available for 114 patients: level-3 HiSeq RSEM gene-normalized RNA-seq data was obtained for 1104 cancerous and 114 normal samples for 20,530 genes. However, some genes had zero values for one or more patients as a result of either there being no transcripts, or transcripts missing for a particular gene. To avoid introducing uncertainty into the statistical analysis, only genes that had non-zero values for all 114 patients in both the cancerous tissue and the normal tissue were included. The data for these 13,983 genes was analyzed using the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality. It was found that data for 73% of the genes in the cancerous dataset, and 45% of the genes in the normal dataset had a normal distribution. As a result, the non-parametric Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was used on the paired data to determine if the median between the cancer sample and the normal sample was statistically different (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Since greater numbers of statistical inferences made from a dataset increases the chances of an error in any of those inferences, it was imperative to account for multiple hypotheses. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for multiple hypotheses comparison was used to adjust <italic>P</italic>-values. To determine the fold change of gene expression between the cancerous and normal tissue, the ratio of gene expression was then calculated (cancer/non-cancer) and the log-base-2 of the ratio was used as the fold change in gene expression in breast cancer. Significant genes were identified using a 2-fold cut off and statistically significant <italic>P</italic>-values (<italic>P</italic>-value after adjustment &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Generating the breast cancer specific sub-network</title><p id="Par14">The breast cancer down-regulation sub-network was generated by extracting the genes that were down-regulated in breast cancer and all of their SL interactions from HYGIN.

Using this information and a strict one-to-one ortholog mapping from yeast to human from InParanoid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1), we generated a refined Humanized Yeast Genetic Interaction Network (HYGIN) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). HYGIN contains all of the yeast orthologs of human genes and their predicted SLIs. Of the ~&#x02009;550,000 negative genetic interactions in yeast (Costanzo et al.; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://thecellmap.org/costanzo2016/">http://thecellmap.org/costanzo2016/</ext-link>, updated May 2016) we evaluated only statistically significant interactions with a <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 that were also strong negative interactions where &#x003b5;&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;0.2. Using InParanoid mapping from yeast to human, the yeast network was reduced to predictive negative interactions that exist between the human orthologs of these yeast genes. The resultant HYGIN contains 1009 human genes and 10,419 proposed SLIs (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2). Topology of this network combined with our Gene Ontology slim terms (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S3) shows dense clustering of genes involved in DNA damage and repair pathways and cell cycle regulators, or RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis and translation components, suggesting we have recovered meaningful humanized genetic interactions as these are highly conserved processes across the evolutionary trajectory (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). Since there are only 1266 yeast genes that map to exactly one human ortholog, it is not surprising that the total number of human genes in the humanized network is less than that in the starting yeast network, as only a fraction of these genes has unique human orthologs.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Network representation of HYGIN.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Although this previous work used the same cut-offs (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 and &#x003b5;&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;0.2), they also used a relaxed cut-off (&#x003b5;&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;0.08) for SLIs that were identified in reciprocal screens. However, to maintain stringency in our work, we used a consistent cut-off value (&#x003b5;&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;-0.2) irrespective of whether an interaction was identified in a reciprocal screen or not. This previous work was compared to HYGIN to determine if there were more interactions identified in our work. Compared to Deshpande et al. who identified 1522 potential SLIs in humans, we have identified 10,419 interactions; however, a total of 777 edges were in common between the two networks (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. One of the reasons that HYGIN contains more SLIs is that our study uses a more recent version of The Cell Map database that includes interactions between essential and nonessential yeast genes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Identification of down-regulated genes in breast cancer and building a breast cancer-specific SL interaction network</title><p id="Par21">To make HYGIN more applicable for human cancer therapeutics, we focused on breast cancer and developed a breast cancer-specific subnetwork. Exploiting any yeast SLI may not be beneficial if neither of the genes is altered in cancers. As a result, in order to identify those interactions in HYGIN that are relevant to breast cancer, we used TCGA data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cancer.gov/tcga/">https://www.cancer.gov/tcga/</ext-link>) to identify genes that are down-regulated in breast cancer. Although there are gene expression data for over 1000 breast cancer patients available in TCGA, because genes expression is a relative measurement, we chose to use only those tumor samples that had matching normal gene expression data. That is, we used data only from patients where gene expression results were available for both cancer and normal tissue. This stringent approach was followed to eliminate those genes that are down-regulated in cancer, but whose expression in normal tissue is also low. For each patient, gene expression data for cancerous and normal tissue was compared to generate a log-base-2 ratio of cancerous to normal gene expression. From this, we identified 1745 genes that were statistically down-regulated in breast cancer with at least a 2-fold change in expression cut off (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S5).

The yeast gene <italic>MET30</italic> encodes an F-box protein containing five copies of the WD40 motif and is known to control cell cycle function as part of a E3 ubiquitin ligase complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. According to InParanoid, FBXW7 is the human ortholog of MET30 that shares similar roles in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3). In fact, FBXW7 is a well-known tumor suppressor that functions as a substrate-recognition protein within a SCF (SKP/CUL1/F-Box) E3 complex ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets numerous proteins for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. <italic>FBXW7</italic> is down-regulated not only in breast cancer, but also in 12 other cancers including colon, liver, lung, and prostate cancers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4).

Our work predicted SLI between <italic>FBXW7</italic> and a member of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP), Ribulose-5-Phosphate-3-Epimerase (RPE), which catalyzes the reversible epimerization of D-ribulose 5-phosphate to D-xylulose 5-phosphate. Interestingly, previous work has shown that inhibition of the PPP results in decreased proliferation of tumor cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In addition, it has also been shown that the PPP is essential for metabolic network modulation to support tumor angiogenesis as inhibition of VEGFR-2 causes a decrease in PPP flux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Thus, if inhibition of VEGFR-2 may decrease PPP flux, we hypothesized that inhibition of VEGFR should mimic the SL interaction between <italic>FBXW7</italic> and <italic>RPE</italic>. To test this idea, we used drug response data from the cancerRXgene database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cancerrxgene.org">https://www.cancerrxgene.org</ext-link>) and asked if cell lines deficient in <italic>FBXW7</italic> are sensitive to the VEGFR-2 inhibitor Cabozantinib. The cancerRXgene database contains data for 265 drugs and multiple cell lines and was examined to identify compounds that are more effective when used selectively with cell lines that have a low <italic>FBXW7</italic> expression. We found that cell lines with low expression of <italic>FBXW7</italic> were more sensitive to Cabozentanib (<italic>P</italic>-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.033) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, c), which supports our hypothesis that inhibition of VEGFR should mimic the SLI between <italic>FBXW7</italic> and <italic>RPE</italic>. Unfortunately, our classification of cell lines based on FBXW7 expression for only breast cancer cell lines did not yield sufficient sample size.</p><p id="Par26">Similarly, we also found a SLI between <italic>FBXW7</italic> and <italic>ADA</italic>, an adenosine deaminase that regulates cellular levels of adenosine and deoxyadenosine. ADA, along with a few other enzymes (for example HGPRT), are responsible for purine metabolism and are well known targets for cancer chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. ADA can both degrade adenosine and bind extracellularly to adenosine receptors to function as an allosteric modulator to regulate adenosine. In fact, studies in a human astrocytoma cells have shown that manipulation of cellular purine metabolite concentrations can make these cells more sensitive to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. While it remains to be explored if the astrocytoma cell line is deficient in <italic>FBXW7</italic>, these studies indicate a potential role for <italic>ADA</italic> as a therapeutic target. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that the expression of <italic>ADA</italic> is induced by growth factors like IGF in a Ras-MAPK pathway dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. To test this idea, we used drug response data from cancerRXgene database and asked if cell lines deficient in <italic>FBXW7</italic> are sensitive to the <italic>MEK</italic> inhibitor Selumitinib that affects the Ras-MAPK pathway (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). Consistent with our SL prediction, we found cells with low expression of <italic>FBXW7</italic> to be more sensitive to Selumitinib (<italic>P</italic>-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0061). Thus, our predictive analyses indicate that <italic>FBXW7</italic> can be used as a biomarker to identify and treat patients with drugs like Selumitinib that indirectly affect the expression of <italic>ADA</italic>. Importantly, the availability of <italic>ADA</italic> inhibitors like 2&#x02019;deoxycoformycin (Pentostatin) that are already in the clinics as standard chemotherapeutic agents for lymphoid malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] may also represent a potential option to test our prediction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par27">In this work we describe a novel approach to identifying potential SLIs in breast cancer that exploits yeast genetic networks in conjunction with strict ortholog mapping and patient gene expression data. Yeast is a common model organism and generating a human orthologous network from a yeast gene network provides a major framework to extend yeast genetic interaction data to humans. When generating HYGIN, strict one-to-one yeast-human ortholog mapping was used to avoid ambiguity as there are several instances where a single yeast protein map to multiple human orthologs, and vice versa. HYGIN is cancer independent, as no assumptions about cancer type are made while generating the network. As a result, any cancer gene expression data can be subsequently applied to generate cancer type specific subnetworks of genetic interactions. We generated a breast cancer specific subnetwork of HYGIN using breast cancer patient data from TCGA.</p><p id="Par28">Most studies tend to evaluate additional data as a means of reaching statistically significant results, or more data as a means of completing an exhaustive analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, we used a more stringent methodology and only analyzed TCGA patient data for which there was gene expression data for both breast cancer tissue and normal breast tissue. This not only increases the confidence in actual gene up- and down-regulation, but it also helps eliminate false positive results that occur due to differences in basal gene expression between individuals. By comparing up- and down-regulation of genes between two like-tissue samples from the same patient, changes in expression are more reliable than pooling cancer samples and comparing them to pooled normal samples. Although this strategy is very stringent, it is also one of the strengths of our gene expression analysis.</p><p id="Par29">The breast cancer specific interaction network produced 130 SL interactions between 15 genes down-regulated in breast cancer and their 115 SL partners. The 15 genes that were identified to be down-regulated in breast cancer were also assessed in 24 other cancer types. Of the 15 genes, 11 of them were statistically down-regulated in more than 15 cancer types including breast cancer (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S5, S6, S7 and S8). Of note, <italic>HAAO</italic>, <italic>MGLL</italic>, and <italic>UPGE</italic> were down-regulated in 18 cancer types; <italic>ADHFE1</italic>, <italic>CAT</italic>, and <italic>MSRA</italic> were down-regulated in 19; and <italic>RGN</italic> was down-regulated in 21 different types of cancer. This information suggests that SLIs identified in breast cancer for these genes would be extremely valuable to explore in other cancers as well. The subnetwork, and ultimately this subset of SLIs, are an ideal starting point for in vitro and in vivo validation studies and suggest novel targeted therapeutic strategies. By extracting 15 genes that were found to be down-regulated in humans and their SL partners, we can target their SL partners with known or novel drugs to develop new treatment strategies on a patient-by-patient basis. Moreover, knowledge in cancer genomics (and hence the literature) is not complete. Hence it is quite possible for a legitimate interaction to exist in HYGIN that is not (yet) documented in the literature. To determine any of these as false positives is difficult; it would require literature that explicitly rules out the interactions from ever actually occurring. Further, we note that the interactions reported by HYGIN that are also not described in the literature are one of the main contributions of HYGIN. Therefore, we feel that HYGIN provides a promising list of potential candidates for future work.</p><p id="Par30">Overall, our analysis identified 32 SL interactions <italic>FBXW7</italic>, many of which are proteasome components such as PSMB3, PSMB4, PSMD2, PSMD7, and USP14. Given that FBXW7 is a E3 ubiquitin ligase, these interactions highlight the genetic property of SL relationships where functional coherence is often observed. As cyclin E is a substrate of proteasome degradation, it is interesting to note that the recently published SLI between <italic>FBXW7</italic> and <italic>CCNE1</italic> may reflect the interaction between FBXW7 and proteasome components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Our stringent ortholog mapping is one-to-one and unfortunately, cyclin E falls into the &#x0201c;more than one ortholog&#x0201d; category in yeast and &#x0201c;more than one corresponding ortholog&#x0201d; in humans, and as a result was not included in HYGIN.</p><p id="Par31">Similarly, our computational prediction suggested a SLI between <italic>FBXW7</italic> and <italic>USP14</italic>, a gene that codes for a deubiquitinating enzyme. FBXW7 has been proposed in the degradation of a number of substrates including Aurora B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Although Aurora B kinase is primarily degraded through the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/c) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], negative regulation of Aurora B by FBXW7 plays an important role in Aurora B ubiquitination and degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. USP14 is a major regulator of the proteasome and one of three proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzymes, which also affects protein turnover in a substrate-specific manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Interestingly, a recent study has reported that over-expression of <italic>USP14</italic> stabilized and prevented Aurora B degradation through deubiquitination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Furthermore, a FBXW7-Aurora B-p53 negative feedback loop has also been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. This feedback loop suggests that a loss of <italic>FBXW7</italic> leads to an increase in Aurora B, which phosphorylates p53 and leads to MDM2 enhanced degradation of p53 and ultimately cancer cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. While the loss of FBXW7 may already stabilize Aurora B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], over-expression of <italic>USP14</italic> may be necessary for continued stability of Aurora B to maintain cell-cycle progression and cell survival. Thus, consistent with our observation, loss of USP14 when <italic>FBXW7</italic> is down-regulated may destabilize Aurora B, leading to a SL phenotype. This meaningful interpretation of the SLIs between FBXW7 and aurora kinases or proteasome components reiterate the potential opportunity of exploiting yeast genetics and the power of HYGIN to identify and predict mechanistically relevant relationships between gene pairs.</p><p id="Par32">Although we have derived supporting data for these SLIs from either drug response data from the cancerRXgene database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cancerrxgene.org">https://www.cancerrxgene.org</ext-link>) or from previous publications, we acknowledge that our predictions require further experimental validations in cell line or animal models of breast cancer. Moreover, SLIs of FBXW7 are potential targets for cancer therapeutics in only some cancers as not all cancers have decreased expression of FBXW7. For example, FBXW7 is also up-regulated in 6 other cancers including three types of kidney cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and thyroid carcinoma (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4). In these instances, the SLIs we have identified will not work. While there are several genes that are either up- or down-regulated in multiple cancers, in the context of synthetic lethality, only those patients with low expression of FBXW7 will benefit from this therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to use this strategy on all tumor types. While targeting SLIs of <italic>FBXW7</italic> may have a wide opportunity for clinical application, it must be used in conjunction with genetic testing and patient gene expression data. Another caveat in our study is that not all classical breast cancer-related tumor suppressors have yeast orthologs. And even if they do, if any of them become an essential gene in yeast, then the current yeast data does not capture this efficiently. Although temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants are used for capturing genetic interactions, distinct ts mutants capture distinct genetic interactions. Thus, as it stands, for the 1745 genes that are down-regulated in breast cancer, even though 181 were previously identified in the Tumor Suppressor Gene database (TSG; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioinfo.uth.edu/TSGene/">https://bioinfo.uth.edu/TSGene/</ext-link>), only 15 of these had yeast orthologs that had interactions in HYGIN. Thus, as powerful as it is, the evolutionary distance between yeast and human has its limitations.</p><p id="Par33">Of note, <italic>FBXW7</italic> and <italic>PEMT</italic> are both down-regulated in breast cancer and they share a proposed SLI in HYGIN. The gene expression ratios for all 114 patients for both <italic>FBXW7</italic> and <italic>PEMT</italic> were evaluated to further investigate this finding. Results showed that 20% of patients have gene expression ratios less than 2-fold for both <italic>FBXW7</italic> and <italic>PEMT</italic>, and one patient had gene expression less than 4-fold for both genes. There are two possibilities that could lead to this result. First, it is possible that at some point in evolutionary time this SLI was valid. However, the cancer cells overcame the SL dependency of these two genes in humans, and what we expect to manifest as cell death results in cell survival. Second, it is possible that this result is a false positive. Previous work has shown that there is only 23% overlap in SLIs between two species of yeast (<italic>S. cereviseae</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. This means that although 65% of genes between these two species retain essential function, SL relationships are lost over evolutionary time. Thus, we are expecting to see a loss of some SLIs in our network as a result of a larger species gap between <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Ultimately, this result highlights the need for careful biological testing of these SLIs. Though the network is based on valid research methods, cell lines and animal models behave differently than predicted results. Therefore, the breast cancer specific network contains interactions that are valuable starting points for SL research moving forward and provides a valuable source of SLIs for the scientific community to explore in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par34">Overall, this study provides a patient-data driven interpretation of yeast SLIs.
