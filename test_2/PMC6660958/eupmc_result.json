    "BACKGROUND:Synthetic lethal interactions (SLIs) that occur between gene pairs are exploited for cancer therapeutics. Studies in the model eukaryote yeast have identified ~â€‰550,000 negative genetic interactions that have been extensively studied, leading to characterization of novel pathways and gene functions. This resource can be used to predict SLIs that can be relevant to cancer therapeutics. METHODS:We used patient data to identify genes that are down-regulated in breast cancer. InParanoid orthology mapping was performed to identify yeast orthologs of the down-regulated genes and predict their corresponding SLIs in humans. The predicted network graphs were drawn with Cytoscape. CancerRXgene database was used to predict drug response. RESULTS:Harnessing the vast available knowledge of yeast genetics, we generated a Humanized Yeast Genetic Interaction Network (HYGIN) for 1009 human genes with 10,419 interactions. Through the addition of patient-data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we generated a breast cancer specific subnetwork. Specifically, by comparing 1009 genes in HYGIN to genes that were down-regulated in breast cancer, we identified 15 breast cancer genes with 130 potential SLIs. Interestingly, 32 of the 130 predicted SLIs occurred with FBXW7, a well-known tumor suppressor that functions as a substrate-recognition protein within a SKP/CUL1/F-Box ubiquitin ligase complex for proteasome degradation. Efforts to validate these SLIs using chemical genetic data predicted that patients with loss of FBXW7 may respond to treatment with drugs like Selumitinib or Cabozantinib. CONCLUSIONS:This study provides a patient-data driven interpretation of yeast SLI data. HYGIN represents a novel strategy to uncover therapeutically relevant cancer drug targets and the yeast SLI data offers a major opportunity to mine these interactions."
