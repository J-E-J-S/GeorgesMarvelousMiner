Previously we found that although engineered <italic>Zymomonas mobilis</italic> 2032 was able to ferment glucose to ethanol when fermenting highly concentrated hydrolyzates such as 9% glucan-loading AFEX-pretreated corn stover hydrolyzate (9% ACSH), xylose conversion after glucose depletion was greatly impaired. We hypothesized that impaired xylose conversion was caused by lignocellulose-derived inhibitors (LDIs) in hydrolyzates. To investigate the effects of LDIs on the cellular physiology of <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> during fermentation of hydrolyzates, including impacts on xylose utilization, we generated synthetic hydrolyzates (SynHs) that contained nutrients and LDIs at concentrations found in 9% ACSH. Comparative fermentations of <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> 2032 using SynH with or without LDIs were performed, and samples were collected for end product, transcriptomic, metabolomic, and proteomic analyses. Several LDI-specific effects were observed at various timepoints during fermentation including upregulation of sulfur assimilation and cysteine biosynthesis, upregulation of RND family efflux pump systems (ZMO0282-0285) and ZMO1429-1432, downregulation of a Type I secretion system (ZMO0252-0255), depletion of reduced glutathione, and intracellular accumulation of mannose-1P and mannose-6P. Furthermore, when grown in SynH containing LDIs, <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> 2032 only metabolized &#x0223c;50% of xylose, compared to &#x0223c;80% in SynH without LDIs, recapitulating the poor xylose utilization observed in 9% ACSH. Our metabolomic data suggest that the overall flux of xylose metabolism is reduced in the presence of LDIs. However, the expression of most genes involved in glucose and xylose assimilation was not affected by LDIs, nor did we observe blocks in glucose and xylose metabolic pathways. Accumulations of intracellular xylitol and xylonic acid was observed in both SynH with and without LDIs, which decreased overall xylose-to-ethanol conversion efficiency. Our results suggest that xylose metabolism in <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> 2032 may not be able to support the cellular demands of LDI mitigation and detoxification during fermentation of highly concentrated lignocellulosic hydrolyzates with elevated levels of LDIs. Together, our findings identify several cellular responses to LDIs and possible causes of impaired xylose conversion that will enable future strain engineering of <italic>Z. mobilis.</italic></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>synthetic hydrolyzates</kwd><kwd>lignocellulose-derived inhibitors</kwd><kwd>xylose utilization</kwd><kwd>multiomic fermentation</kwd><kwd>ethanol production</kwd><kwd>RND family efflux pump systems</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">U.S. Department of Energy<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000015</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="51"/><page-count count="18"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biofuel production from plant biomass provides a renewable and sustainable path to energy security.

Lignocellulosic hydrolyzates are primarily comprised of C6 and C5 sugar monomers, with glucose and xylose as the most abundant monomers respectively (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Keating et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Serate et al., 2015</xref>). However, neither <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> nor <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> can natively metabolize the xylose that is abundant in lignocellulosic hydrolyzates.</p><p>Two xylose-utilizing strains of <italic>Z. mobilis</italic>, named <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> 2032 and <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> 8b, have been engineered by integration of <italic>E. coli talB-tktA</italic> and <italic>xylA-xylB</italic> genes into the chromosome or plasmids of wild-type <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> ZM4 (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 1995</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Although both <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> 2032 and 8b can readily ferment xylose in rich medium (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 1995</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Franden et al., 2013</xref>), xylose utilization remains slow, inefficient, and often incomplete in lignocellulosic hydrolyzates (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Serate et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Several studies demonstrate that the high osmolarity of hydrolyzates, presence of lignocellulose-derived inhibitors (LDIs), and end-product toxicity can negatively affect microbial conversion of sugars in lignocellulosic hydrolyzates, especially xylose (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Schwalbach et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Keating et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, we investigated the impacts of biomass feedstock variability on microbial conversion using both <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> as model ethanologens (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Ong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Although <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> 2032 exhibits greater tolerance to LDIs than <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Y128, xylose-utilizing strains of both organisms struggle to metabolize xylose when grown in hydrolyzates with elevated LDIs (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Ong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). For example, both <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Y128 and <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> 2032 utilize xylose poorly when grown in AFEX-pretreated corn stover hydrolysate (ACSH) from the year 2014 compared to ACSH from 2012 (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). We identified elevated levels of LDIs in 2014-ACSH compared to 2012-ACSH, including ferulic and <italic>p-</italic>coumaric acids and feruloyl and coumaroyl amides. Adding these LDIs into 2012-ACSH to match 2014-ACSH levels inhibits xylose utilization to an extent resembling its use in 2014-ACSH (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> 2032 exhibits poor xylose utilization when grown in highly concentrated 9%-glucan loading ACSH (9% ACSH) compared to 6%-glucan loading ACSH (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To provide consistent, but manipulable conditions for study of cellular responses to LDIs during fermentation of hydrolyzates, we developed synthetic hydrolyzates (SynHs) (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Schwalbach et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Keating et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Serate et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2015</xref>). Our initial studies examined engineered, ethanologenic <italic>E. coli</italic> grown in SynH containing glucose, xylose, salts, amino acids, nucleobases, vitamins, and micronutrients at levels found in 6% ACSH (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Schwalbach et al., 2012</xref>). In this SynH, <italic>E. coli</italic> exhibits stress responses induced by high osmolarity, LDIs, and ethanol. Further analysis of 6% ACSH led to a revised SynH version (SynH2) that includes osmoprotectants, acids, acetamide, additional sugars, and 14 LDIs, all added at concentrations found in 6% ACSH. We also created SynH2<sup>&#x02013;</sup> which lacks all LDIs (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Keating et al., 2014</xref>). We used both SynH2<sup>&#x02013;</sup> and SynH2 along with 6% ACSH for systems-level studies of anaerobic growth of ethanologenic <italic>E. coli</italic>. Our studies identified several key regulators of cellular responses to LDIs that reduce the rate of ethanol production, especially during xylose conversion to ethanol (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Keating et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Transcriptome profiling has been used to study the effects of some LDIs on <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> physiology. The majority of these studies focused on the effects of a single, abundant inhibitor, such as ethanol, acetate, furfural, or 5-hydroxymethylfurfural on <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> grown in rich or minimal media. However, the inhibitor concentrations used in these studies were often much higher than the concentrations found in real biomass hydrolyzates. Furthermore, cells were not subjected to the additional stresses of biomass hydrolyzates such as high osmolality, which exhibits synergistic inhibition with LDIs (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2014b</xref>). To characterize the physiological impacts of LDIs on <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> in an industrially relevant context, we have developed a new version of SynH modeled on highly concentrated 9% ACSH, with and without added LDIs. We named these hydrolyzates SynH3 (with LDIs) and SynH3<sup>&#x02013;</sup> (without LDIs). We compared the cellular responses of xylose-utilizing <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> 2032 grown in SynH3<sup>&#x02013;</sup> or SynH3 by collecting and analyzing multiple omics-type data (multiomics) including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. Our study focused on understanding how <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> responds to LDIs in SynH3 compared to SynH3<sup>&#x02013;</sup>. We sought to identify the potential causes of impaired xylose conversion in the presence of LDIs. Addressing these effects will provide crucial information for engineering <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> strains with improved productivities of biofuels and bioproducts from lignocellulosic hydrolyzates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>Strains and Growth Media</title><p>Engineered xylose-utilizing <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> 2032 (ATCC31821-5C P<italic>gap_taltkt</italic>/P<italic>gap xylAB</italic>, PTA-6977) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The rich media with glucose (ZRMG, containing 10 g yeast extract/L, 2 g KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>/L, 20 g glucose/L) or rich media with both glucose and xylose (RMGX, containing 10 g yeast extract/L, 2 g KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>/L, 100 g glucose/L, 20 g xylose/L) were used for initial cultivation of 2032. To increase buffer capacity and maintain pH, extra phosphate (0.8 g KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>/L and 2 g K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>/L) was added into RMGX, which was named as RMGXP.</p></sec><sec id="S2.SS2"><title>Preparation of SynH Media</title><p>Two synthetic hydrolyzate media used in these studies (SynH3<sup>&#x02013;</sup> and SynH3) were based on a previously described synthetic hydrolyzate medium (SynHv2.1) that mimics 6% glucan-loading AFEX-corn stover hydrolyzate (6% ACSH) (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Serate et al., 2015</xref>). To mimic 9% ACSH, SynH3<sup>&#x02013;</sup> (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) (aka SynHv3.8) was made by increasing the media composition of SynHv2.1 by 1.5-fold with the following additional modifications. To prevent Fe loss due to filtration of FeCl<sub>3</sub> precipitate, FeCl<sub>3</sub> was replaced with Fe-citrate, 1.5 mM sodium citrate was added, and 90 g/L of cellobiose was added to match the osmolarity of 9% ACSH (&#x0223c;1920 mmol/kg). <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> 2032 is unable to metabolize cellobiose meaning that the osmolarity of SynH3<sup>&#x02013;</sup> will remain high throughout our fermentation experiments. We hypothesize that the lower osmolarity of SynH3<sup>&#x02013;</sup>, prior to the addition of 90 g cellobiose/L, may be due to 9% ACSH components that are missing in our SynH recipe, likely stemming from an inability to identify or measure these compounds. This was an important modification as our previous work with <italic>E. coli</italic> highlighted osmotic stress as a key aspect of the stress response of <italic>E. coli</italic> to SynH and ACSH (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Schwalbach et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Keating et al., 2014</xref>). SynH3 (aka SynHv3.8) was generated by adding 25 LDIs (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) to SynH3<sup>&#x02013;</sup> at LDI concentrations largely based on the composition analysis of 9% ACSH. All chemicals used for SynH, except two LDIs, were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Hampton, NH, United States) and Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, United States).

Height was determined to be the best method to quantify using this assay because most sugar species are not baseline resolved which leads to difficulty performing accurate peak area integration. Chromatographic co-elution and isobaric fragment ions shared between xylulose and ribulose posed a significant challenge to quantification. However, we observed two peaks when analyzing ribulose alone, though not baseline separated, and only one peak when running xylulose alone.

Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed an almost sevenfold decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) between T1 and T4 for cells grown in SynH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Furthermore, GSH levels were lower in SynH3 compared to SynH3<sup>&#x02013;</sup> at all timepoints. An increased demand for GSH is consistent with the role of GSH in cellular responses to many toxic compounds and stresses (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson and Booth, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Carmel-Harel and Storz, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Pompella et al., 2003</xref>). GSH is also important for maintaining redox balance in the cytoplasm and for post-translational modification of proteins. The decrease in intracellular GSH in cells grown in SynH3 relative to SynH3<sup>&#x02013;</sup> may arise from increased GSH export, increased GSH conjugation to proteins and other substrates, such as LDIs, downregulation of GSH biosynthetic genes, inhibition of biosynthetic proteins, or limited availability of precursor substrates. Although we were unable to measure intracellular cysteine in our samples, upregulation of <italic>cysCNDG1HIJ</italic> suggests a decrease cysteine pools, activated sulfur pools, or both. Thus cysteine limitation, along with a decrease in glutamic acid at T3 and T4, may be the key contributor to decreased GSH levels in SynH3. Interestingly GSH biosynthesis genes <italic>gshA</italic> and <italic>gshB</italic> were downregulated at T3 which likely contributed to decreased GSH levels. Although decreased <italic>gshAB</italic> expression may appear contradictory to GSH stress, <italic>gshAB</italic> may be downregulated in response to cysteine limitation, by decreased cellular activity, or both. Notably sulfur assimilation is one of the most energetically costly cellular processes, suggesting a simple possibility that energy stress resulting from cellular responses to LDIs may compromise sulfur assimilation and thereby impact sulfur-containing metabolites.</p><p>We also observed a marked intracellular accumulation of mannose-1P and mannose-6P at T3 and T4. Though mannose sugar phosphate accumulation occurred in both SynH3<sup>&#x02013;</sup> and SynH3, this accumulation was greater in SynH3 which may be attributed, in part, to upregulation of mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase (ZMO1233) specifically in SynH3 at T4.

It is unknown if sugar phosphate accumulation causes toxicity in <italic>Z. mobilis</italic>, but if it is possible that mannose phosphate accumulation in SynH3 at T3 and T4 could exacerbate LDI toxicity, possibly to an extent that the cells cannot recover. Interestingly, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Skerker et al.

Here, we demonstrated that LDIs are a major contributor to poor xylose utilization in <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> 2032 through the use of synthetic hydrolyzates with and without LDIs added. Although we have identified several cellular responses of <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> 2032 to LDI stress, the mechanisms by which LDIs specifically inhibit xylose utilization in <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> remain elusive. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Pisithkul et al. (2015)</xref> found that feruloyl amide and coumaroyl amide act as potent and fast-acting inhibitors of purine and pyrimidine biosynthetic pathways. The block in <italic>de novo</italic> nucleotide biosynthesis leads to growth inhibition and subsequent cessation of carbon metabolism. However, we did not observe LDI-specific impacts on the expression patterns of glucose or xylose metabolizing genes in <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> nor did we observe any metabolic blocks in these pathways.</p><p>Overall, xylose flux appeared to be lower in SynH3 compared to SynH3<sup>&#x02013;</sup>. Less carbon flux would result in production of less ATP and NAD(P)H, which are needed to mitigate LDI toxicity. Decreased flux may be due to decreased xylose uptake, decreased metabolic processing of xylose, or both. Glucose and xylose uptake occur <italic>via</italic> facilitated diffusion by Glf (ZMO0366). <italic>glf</italic> expression decreases over the course of our batch fermentations, but <italic>glf</italic> is not differentially expressed between SynH3<sup>&#x02013;</sup> and SynH3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">Supplementary Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM8">S6</xref>). Higher accumulation of mannose phosphates in SynH3 would require increased uptake of <sc>D</sc>-mannose <italic>via glf</italic>, which could limit <italic>glf</italic> availability for xylose and thus reduce xylose uptake. Alternatively, increased cellular efflux, <italic>via</italic> upregulation of ZMO0282-0285 and ZMO1429-1432, could contribute to xylose efflux, by competing with Glf for space in outer and inner membranes (IM), or both. Recent studies have found that increased expression of non-PTS carbohydrate transporters (e.g., xylose transporter) by growth on alternative carbon sources or overexpression of unrelated IM proteins competes with antibiotic efflux systems for inner and outer membrane space in gram-negative bacteria. In these studies, competition for IM space decreased efflux-mediated resistance to different antimicrobial compounds (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Villagra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hidalgo et al., 2018</xref>). Conversely, in <italic>Z. mobilis</italic>, efflux pump upregulation could affect xylose transport in an analogous manner since Glf may not be efficient at xylose transport.</p><p>Reduced xylose flux could also be driven by a decrease in cellular metabolism. The production of xylitol and xylonic acid observed at T3 and T4 in both SynH3<sup>&#x02013;</sup> and SynH3 reduced the efficiency of xylose conversion to ethanol and subsequent NAD<sup>+</sup> renewal. Furthermore, xylitol production via xylose reductase (ZMO0976) consumes NAD(P)H (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Agrawal and Chen, 2011</xref>). We recently reported that <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> 2032 contains a single adenosine insertion in ZMO096 that causes a frameshift and subsequent premature stop codon after 235 amino acids (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). The activity of truncated xylulose reductase is unknown but our results suggest the truncated ZMO0976 may still be active or that glucose-fructose oxidoreductase (ZMO0689) may be producing xylitol <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). In <italic>Gluconobacter</italic>, glucose dehydrogenase oxidizes glucose to gluconic acid and xylose to xylonic acid. In some bacteria, two enzymes are involved: xylose dehydrogenase catalyzes the 1st step to convert xylose to <sc>D</sc>-xylono-&#x003b3;-lactone and xylonolactonase converts it to xylonic acid. It is also suggested that ZMO1649 (Gluconolactonase) might convert xylose to xylonic acid (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2014</xref>), but an experimental test remains to be performed. A few glucose dehydrogenases were also found in <italic>Z. mobilis</italic>, but it is unknown if these enzymes could also catalyze the conversion of xylose to xylonic acid.</p><p>Given that <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> metabolism of glucose is largely unaffected by LDIs, metabolic changes accompanying a shift to xylose metabolism are likely impeding the ability of <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> to manage the toxic effects of LDIs. Sulfur assimilation is an energy intensive process, requiring 2 ATP, a reduced thioredoxin, and 3 NADPH per atom of sulfur that is activated and assimilated. Several studies in <italic>E. coli</italic> have proposed that cells lose reducing power due to consumption of NAD(P)H for detoxification of LDIs which in turn inhibits sulfur assimilation (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2009</xref>). When the high energy demands of detoxification and sulfur assimilation are considered, it seems likely that inefficient xylose metabolism is unable to support the cofactor and energy needs of <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> in the presence of high levels of LDIs. Methods for improving xylose uptake and subsequent conversion to ethanol in lignocellulosic hydrolyzates with high LDIs may help to overcome the metabolic burden of LDI toxicity. Our findings suggest several avenues for future efforts aimed at elucidating the mechanisms of LDI toxicity and at improving xylose uptake and conversion in <italic>Z. mobilis</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The datasets generated for this study can be found in the RNA-Seq data are available through the National Biotechnology Center Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="GSE135718">GSE135718</ext-link>.
