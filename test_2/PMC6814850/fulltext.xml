Understanding how our closest evolutionary relatives, nonhuman primates (NHPs), confront pathogens and how these responses have evolved over time could shed light on host range barriers, especially for zoonotic infections. Here, we analyzed cell-intrinsic immunity of primary cells from the broadest panel of NHP species interrogated to date, including humans, great apes, and Old and New World monkeys. Our analysis of their transcriptomes after poly(I:C) transfection revealed conservation in the functional consequences of their response. In mapping reads to either the human or the species-specific genomes, we observed that with the current state of NHP annotations, the percent of reads assigned to a genetic feature was largely similar regardless of the method. Together, these data provide a baseline for the cell-intrinsic responses elicited by a potent immune stimulus across multiple NHP donors, including endangered species, and serve as a resource for refining and furthering the existing annotations of NHP genomes.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="gs1"><funding-source id="sp1"><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">R01 AI107301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ploss</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs2"><funding-source id="sp2"><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="sp2">R21AI117213</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ploss</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Schwartz</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs3"><funding-source id="sp3"><institution-wrap><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="sp3">RSG-15-048-01-MPC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ploss</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs4"><funding-source id="sp4"><institution-wrap><institution>Princeton University Center for Health and Wellbeing Health Grand Challenge Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ploss</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Gaska</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs5"><funding-source id="sp5"><institution-wrap><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="sp5">101539</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ploss</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs6"><funding-source id="sp6"><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="sp6">T32GM007388</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gaska</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many of the pathogens with a significant impact on human morbidity and mortality&#x02014;such as HIV, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, and yellow fever virus&#x02014;have a narrow host range limited to humans and select nonhuman primate (NHP) species (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Broadly speaking, the host tropism of such viral pathogens can be determined by (i) the absence or incompatibility of (a) host factor(s) needed for part(s) of the viral life cycle; (ii) the presence of dominant restriction factors; and/or (iii) differences in immune responses. Understanding the molecular basis of host tropism can inform our understanding of intra- and interspecies transmission and aid in the generation of improved animal models and clinical therapies. Here, we analyzed how cell-intrinsic immune responses compare across humans and NHP species. As our closest evolutionary relatives, the tactics by which NHPs have evolved to confront pathogens and the corresponding ways those pathogens modulate host immune defenses&#x02014;as highlighted by hotspots for positive selection in genes involved with immune/defense responses in humans and select NHPs ((<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), reviewed in reference <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)&#x02014;could shed light on host range barriers pertinent to studying zoonotic infections and using NHPs as biomedical research models.</p><p>In the present study, we purposefully chose a cell type that could be easily collected from a wide array of multiple NHP species, was conducive to studies of cell-intrinsic immune responses and could be used for future generation of induced pluripotent stem cells to study host&#x02013;pathogen interactions in desired cell lineages. The latter criterion would be especially advantageous for studying pathogens with both highly limited host and tissue tropism, such as hepatitis C virus, for which acquiring hepatocytes from NHPs can be extremely challenging for both ethical and financial reasons. Dermal fibroblasts (DFs) met all these requirements and could be obtained through biopsies or existing repositories. As an added advantage, we used only primary DFs which do not have the cell cycle dysregulation or disruption of immune signaling as observed for immortalized cells such as human hepatoma cell lines (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>We selected three donors from eight different NHP species covering &#x0223c;35 million years of evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>): great apes (<italic>Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, Gorilla gorilla, </italic>and<italic> Pongo pygmaeus</italic>), because of their close genetic relationship to humans but whose endangered status precludes their use in most scientific studies; three Old World monkey species (<italic>Papio anubis, Macaca nemestrina, </italic>and<italic> Macaca mulatta</italic>); and one New World species (<italic>Saimiri sciureus</italic>), which are all commonly used in biomedical research. As a more distant point in evolutionary time (ca. 65 million years since divergence), we also included mouse. For our initial studies comparing cell-intrinsic immunity in these DFs from diverse species, we aimed to provoke an immune response independent of a given species&#x02019; susceptibility and/or permissivity to a virus. Thus, we used polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a synthetic dsRNA analog that can be transfected into cells and potently stimulates an IFN-mediated response by resembling a pathogen-associated molecular pattern characteristic of RNA virus infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>) (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This allowed us to compare the repertoire of cell-intrinsic responses available to DFs from each of these species unhindered by pathogen-mediated modulation that can occur as early as viral binding and entry.</p><fig fig-type="featured" id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparing the cell-intrinsic immune response to poly(I:C) across multiple species.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Schematic representation of the phylogenetic relationship of species included in this study. <bold>(B)</bold> Overview of the experimental workflow. <bold>(C, D, E)</bold> Using RT-qPCR, <italic>IFN&#x003b2;</italic> (C), <italic>MX1</italic> (D), and <italic>OASL</italic> (E) mRNA expression were assessed in primate and mouse primary DFs relative to the housekeeping gene <italic>HPRT1</italic> at 12 and/or 24 h after poly(I:C) (&#x0223c;53 ng/cm<sup>2</sup>) or mock transfection.

Although the evolution of select factors in response to host&#x02013;pathogen conflict has been explored (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), there has not been a comprehensive analysis of cell-intrinsic responses in nonimmune cells across a diverse range of NHPs.

Furthermore, such studies often use a limited number of NHP species and focus on differences at the genetic level versus expression. To our knowledge, the closest study to ours examining the functional consequences of differences and similarities in innate immunity in NHPs stimulated primary monocytes from chimpanzee, rhesus, and human with LPS (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Two more recent studies also provided insights into cell-intrinsic immunity but on a much larger evolutionary scale, including human or human and rhesus macaque as the only primates (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>The immense transcriptomic dataset we have acquired and analyzed in the course of this work fulfills a need for not only better understanding cell-intrinsic immunity in our closest evolutionary relatives but also providing additional sequencing information from NHP species, including those that are endangered. In this study, we mapped the data from each species both to the human genome and to the species-specific genomes, creating the added opportunity of comparing these two approaches in parallel. Overall, we observed a high level of conservation in the functional responses of the NHP DFs to poly(I:C) and found that with the current state of genome annotations, the percent of reads assigned to a genetic feature were largely similar between the two mapping methods. We anticipate that making these data available will enhance the continued efforts to more fully annotate NHP genomes and to aid in the identification of novel transcripts unobserved in humans. In addition, we believe these unique data will greatly facilitate evolutionary analyses, especially in the area of comparative immunology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results|discussion" id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s3"><title>Expression of select interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in response to poly(I:C) varies across diverse species</title><p>Triggering innate immune sensing pathways characteristically provokes the induction of hundreds of ISGs, which collectively create an antiviral state. However, it remains unclear how similar such responses are across NHP species. To initially test whether poly(I:C) would elicit a cell-intrinsic response in the DFs we had from 10 different species (each represented by three donors), we first assessed transcription via RT-qPCR of <italic>IFN&#x003b2;</italic> at 12 and 24 h post-transfection and two well-characterized ISGs, myxoma resistance protein 1 (<italic>MX1</italic>) and 2&#x02032;-5&#x02032;-oligoadenylate synthetase-like (<italic>OASL</italic>, <italic>Oasl1</italic> in mice), 24 h post-transfection using species-specific primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs 1C&#x02013;E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">S1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2</xref>). <italic>IFN&#x003b2;</italic> mRNA had on average less than a 10-fold change in expression relative to mock-transfected cells for most species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>). However, bonobo, gorilla, orangutan, and squirrel monkey did exceed this for at least one of the time points tested. Bonobo and gorilla had significantly higher <italic>IFN&#x003b2;</italic> expression at 12 h compared with 24 h, whereas the opposite trend was observed for rhesus macaque. The two ISGs examined demonstrated far greater fold changes relative to mock-transfected cells, underscoring the prominence of the downstream response to IFN at 24 h post-transfection. All species, with the exception of mouse, had at least an average 100-fold increase relative to mock in <italic>MX1</italic> mRNA, although there was marked variation amongst rhesus donors. Average levels of <italic>OASL</italic> mRNA were also elevated across the primate donors, albeit with greater donor variation, but all three mouse donors still displayed minimal change. The donor&#x02013;donor variation we observed was not surprising as the NHP fibroblasts were acquired from outbred donors, with at least one male and one female represented for each species. As these data represent only a small sample of the hundreds of ISGs (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) whose expression could be changing after poly(I:C) transfection, we performed RNA-Seq on total mRNA isolated from these DFs 24 h post-transfection for a more comprehensive view. Unlike recent studies that looked earlier at 4 h post-immune stimulation (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), we wanted to analyze effects further downstream as the cell-intrinsic response was amplified over time.</p><fig fig-type="supplementary-material" id="figS1" specific-use="collapsible" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure S1.</label><caption><title>Extended kinetics of IFN&#x003b2; expression in select donors.</title><p>For select donors, time points were collected in addition to those at 12 and 24 h post-transfection with poly(I:C) (&#x0223c;53 ng/cm<sup>2</sup>) or mock transfection as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>.

Since the genomes for human and mouse are well-annotated and species-specific resources available for downstream analyses, we felt confident in aligning reads from these species to their respective genomes. However, for the NHP species, to make our analysis more thorough, we used two approaches in parallel: mapping all primate-derived reads to the human genome as previously performed (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) (hereby referred to as &#x0201c;human method&#x0201d;) or to their respective genomes as they currently exist on Ensembl (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) (&#x0201c;species method&#x0201d;). Human and mouse reads averaged above 90% alignment and &#x0223c;80% assignment. For the great ape species examined, the percent alignment was generally the same regardless of the genome used, exceeding 85% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig S3</xref>). For the Old World monkeys, there was a small but noticeable decline when mapping to the human genome, with percent alignment close to 85% for the macaques and dipping under 80% for samples from olive baboon. Aligning reads from each of these species to their respective genomes increased these values, especially for rhesus and pig-tailed macaque, which approached 90% and 95%, respectively. Moving further out evolutionarily, squirrel monkey had the lowest percent alignment to the human genome, but still most reads did map, centering around 70%. Not surprisingly, more than 90% of reads were aligned when the squirrel monkey genome was used.</p><table-wrap id="tbl2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Reference genomes used.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Species</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reference genome</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Last genebuild update</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Orangutan</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ppyg2 (Ensembl 93)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">August 2012</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gorilla</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">gorGor4 (Ensembl 95)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">January 2018</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pig-tailed macaque</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mnem_1.0 (Ensembl 95)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">January 2018</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rhesus macaque</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mmul_8_0_1 (Ensembl 95)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">October 2016</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bonobo</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">panpan1.1 (Ensembl 95)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">January 2018</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chimpanzee</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pan_tro_3.0 (Ensembl 95)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">January 2018</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Olive baboon</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">papAnu2 (Ensembl 95)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">January 2018</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Squirrel monkey</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SaiBol1.0 (Ensembl 95)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">January 2018</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Human</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GRCh38 (Ensembl 96)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">November 2018</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mouse</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GRCm38 (Ensembl 85)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">May 2016</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig fig-type="supplementary-material" id="figS3" specific-use="collapsible" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure S3.</label><caption><title>The percentage of RNA-Seq reads aligned and assigned for each species after mapping to either the human genome or the species-specific genome.</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from DFs 24 h after poly(I:C) or mock transfection followed by cDNA library preparation and sequencing.

Notably, this was consistent across NHP species, irrespective of evolutionary relationship to humans. Thus, the percentage of reads assigned a feature was generally comparable between the two mapping methods or better by the &#x0201c;human&#x0201d; method. The NHP genome annotations as they currently exist resulted in on average anywhere from &#x0223c;12&#x02013;22% of reads mapping to sequence with no assigned feature (for comparison, &#x0003c;5% of human and mouse reads fell in this category after alignment to their respective genomes). In contrast, less than 5.5% of reads fell in this category when using the &#x0201c;human method.&#x0201d; Identifying what these unassigned features might be beyond the extensive homologous sequence searching across existing genomes already performed by Ensembl is outside the scope of this article. These data highlight the weaknesses of the current NHP genome annotations and the core difficulty in performing comparative analyses, as the more divergent, species-specific sequences will still be missed regardless of the genome used.

With a few exceptions, when a gene&#x02019;s expression was significantly different between treatment conditions in the NHP species, the expression of the NHP genes tended to follow the same trend as humans but at a weaker magnitude. In the smaller group of genes different across all species compared with human, all the genes except one demonstrated decreased or negligible change in expression after poly(I:C) transfection in the NHP species but increased expression in humans. The exception, an InnateDB gene phosphoinositide-3-kinase adaptor protein 1 (<italic>PIK3AP1</italic>; plays a role in immune cell development and controlling cytokine production), stood out as being up-regulated, albeit at a lower magnitude than in humans, in squirrel monkey, gorilla, and bonobo but negligibly changed in the remaining species.

Although innate immune genes were present amongst genes differentially expressed in NHP but not in human samples, it was unclear if this handful of players was resulting in large-scale differences in the cell-intrinsic immune responses of these various species to poly(I:C). Furthermore, as only one time point post-transfection was tested in this study, it is impossible to determine if genes with altered expression from humans are differentially stimulated by poly(I:C) or the result of varying transcriptional kinetics. For a broader overview of these DGE profiles, we performed gene set analysis, whereby data are assessed for an enrichment of genes related in some way, such as their participation in the same pathway or biological function (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Because each species was limited to its own number of one-to-one orthologs, we prepared a human DGE profile for each species limited in the same way to ease comparisons. We used the R package Generally Applicable Gene-set Enrichment (GAGE) (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) to determine the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) pathways with the most significantly altered gene expression after poly(I:C) transfection. To reflect the nature of pathways in biological systems, bidirectional changes in gene expression were considered when determining pathway enrichment. For each NHP species besides rhesus macaque and regardless of the mapping method, genes were significantly enriched (q<sub>val</sub> &#x02264; 0.09) for multiple pathways known to be important for cell-intrinsic immune responses, either directly or indirectly, including Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor signaling, cytosolic DNA sensing, JAK-STAT signaling, antigen processing and presentation, and chemokine signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5</xref>; the latter two were also significant for mice, <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Although all the NHPs had pathway profiles that corresponded well with the accompanying human profile, rhesus macaque failed to meet the significance cutoff for any pathway. This was not due to limiting the list of genes to one-to-one orthologs as evidenced by the accompanying human profile, which was limited to the same gene list. The top-ranking pathways were the same as the other species but likely did not pass the significance threshold because of the lower number of differentially expressed genes relative to the other species. In some instances, such as NOD-like receptor signaling for olive baboon and retinoic acid-inducible gene I&#x02013;like receptor signaling for bonobo, the significance value fell just outside of the cutoff, indicating that although perhaps not to the same extent as the other NHPs, these pathways are still important. Apoptosis and osteoclast differentiation genes stood out as clearly significant in their enrichment only for squirrel monkey and some of the corresponding human profiles. Although apoptosis is less unexpected, osteoclast differentiation could be appearing as a result of the common origin of osteoclasts and immune cells from hematopoietic cells and the role of TLR stimulation in disrupting osteoclast differentiation (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Enrichment of genes involved with cell-intrinsic immune pathways dominate the response to poly(I:C) across all species.</title><p><bold>(A, B)</bold> Read counts mapped to the human (A) or species-specific genomes (B) were limited on a species-by-species basis to the Ensembl IDs that had a one-to-one human ortholog (referenced as &#x0201c;species orthologs&#x0201d; in the main text).

In using a synthetic compound as a proxy for RNA virus infection, we were able to analyze transcriptomic responses without having to account for species-specific permissiveness and/or susceptibility to a pathogen. While there were of course differences in individual gene expression profiles after poly(I:C) transfection across species, these ultimately resulted in similar outcomes, activating pathways important to cell-intrinsic immunity. We compared our findings to a recent study of rhesus, mouse, and human primary DFs transfected with poly(I:C) for 4 h (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Although our time point was 20 h later, some of these early genes (filtered for primates to those with a one-to-one human ortholog) remained up-regulated in these same species at 24 h (<italic>P</italic><sub>adj</sub> &#x02264; 0.05, log<sub>2</sub>(foldchange) &#x02265; 3) &#x02212; &#x0223c;22% for rhesus, &#x0223c;38% for mouse, and &#x0223c;60% for human (<inline-supplementary-material mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="LSA-2019-00495_Supplemental_Data_7.zip" id="d35e2108" content-type="local-data">Supplemental Data 7</inline-supplementary-material>). This comparison highlights the rapid nature of cell-intrinsic immune responses and the sustained transcription of these responses promoted by continued ISG production. However, it also suggests species&#x02013;species differences in the kinetics of such responses that will be an important area for further research. Similarly, among the 62 genes that were commonly increased in response to type I IFN treatment in species far more divergent from the ones we studied (bats, chicken, horse, sheep, rat, cow, human, and pig) (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), from 50% (rhesus) to 77% (squirrel monkey) of the genes that had a one-to-one human ortholog in each of our NHP species (&#x0003e;90% of the 62 genes) were also up-regulated 24 h post-poly(I:C) treatment using the same cutoffs as those of Shaw et al (<italic>P</italic><sub>adj</sub> &#x02264; 0.05, log<sub>2</sub>(foldchange) &#x02265; 2; <inline-supplementary-material mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="LSA-2019-00495_Supplemental_Data_8.zip" id="d35e2123" content-type="local-data">Supplemental Data 8</inline-supplementary-material>).

In transfecting the cells with poly(I:C), we provoked a response that is not tempered by the antagonism of viral proteins and thus closer to what the potential cell-intrinsic immune response of these cells would be if left uninhibited by the actions of viral proteins. As a result, the data presented here do not presume to predict the susceptibility of these species to particular viral pathogens or whether other cell types from these species would react the same way. We tested the assumption that the species&#x02019; response to poly(I:C) would be highly similar as this had not previously been formally demonstrated for all of these species. Thus, although striking differences between species would have been of great interest, a quantitative demonstration of their similarity is still very useful. Knowing the unfettered capabilities of these cells in terms of cell-intrinsic immunity provides a solid foundation to explore how this more maximal response is potentially dampened by the interplay of host and viral proteins.</p><p>In addition, as alluded to above, because we only examined one time point, the kinetics of the transcriptomic response provides another area for future analysis that could demonstrate interesting differences across species. These data will serve as an important baseline for such work, showing what transcriptional responses are possible and how they are impacted upon exposure to a pathogen. Furthermore, because the current study only examined poly-A&#x02013;containing RNA transcripts, we cannot exclude the role of other RNA species, such as long non-coding RNAs that are becoming of increasing interest in NHP genomics ((<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), reviewed in reference <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our parallel workflow allowed us to compare the benefits of mapping to the human versus the species-specific genome for these NHP species. The broader outcomes, such as the pathway enrichment analysis, were strongly similar between the two methods, and as noted earlier, the additional alignment gained by using species-specific genomes was often to regions with no features yet assigned. As a further comparison of the two mapping methods, we examined the top 500 most significantly differentially expressed genes ultimately identified after either the &#x0201c;species method&#x0201d; or the &#x0201c;human method.&#x0201d; Depending on the species, 88&#x02013;93% of the top 500 most significant genes overlapped between the two mapping methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS11">Fig S11</xref> and <inline-supplementary-material mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="LSA-2019-00495_Supplemental_Data_9.zip" id="d35e2161" content-type="local-data">Supplemental Data 9</inline-supplementary-material>). For each set of 500 genes from a given mapping method, we compared the log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) and significance for those same genes from the alternative mapping method. The log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) values were highly correlated and we observed for each species less than 15 genes that were (i) significantly differentially expressed by one approach (<italic>P</italic><sub>adj</sub> &#x02265; 0.05) but not the other or (ii) had a log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) value that was 1.5 times higher or lower in one mapping method versus the other and also had a |log<sub>2</sub>(fold change)| &#x02265; 2 in at least one of the mapping methods. For genes that met these criteria, the differing expression between mapping methods was due to a variety of reasons. Reads which mapped to a region that had overlapping annotations in one of the reference genomes but not the other caused those reads to be excluded for not mapping to a unique feature. In other instances, multiple transcripts of the same gene were annotated covering a large region in one reference but not the other, so although alignment was observed by either mapping reference, an annotation only existed for one of the genomes.</p><fig fig-type="supplementary-material" id="figS11" specific-use="collapsible" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure S11.</label><caption><title>Comparing the top 500 most significantly differentially expressed genes between the two mapping methods.</title><p>In the left column are the top 500 most significantly (based off <italic>P</italic><sub>adj</sub> value) differentially expressed genes found after using the species-specific genome for mapping, with the genes arranged by increasing log<sub>2</sub>(foldchange) for the species mapping method (shown in purple).

RNA-Seq datasets such as ours can help identify novel exons or in some cases aid in rectifying feature assignments at regions where exons were incorrectly annotated. For example, as alluded to above, a given gene in the human genome may have more annotated transcript variants that can sometimes cover a larger region and lead to read assignment, whereas the orthologous NHP gene, with sometimes only one listed variant, has no reads assigned to it as the reads map but to an area outside of the limited region where the single variant was annotated. In making these data available, we anticipate that they will facilitate continued efforts to annotate the genomes of NHP species and to identify additional transcript variants of already annotated genes as well as completely novel transcripts unobserved in humans. As with the &#x0201c;1,000 Genomes Project&#x0201d; for human samples (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), having more sequencing data available from multiple individuals for a given species aids in identifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms and other sources of genomic variation to improve annotations. We explicitly strove to include at least one male and one female with varying ages across the three donors. This is far more reflective of the natural variance that exists in any outbred species population and makes our sequencing reads all the more useful, especially for genomes, such as that of orangutan, sourced from a single individual. We hope our present analysis and this data collection more broadly will serve as a springboard for additional evolutionary analysis and comparisons.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s9"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s10"><title>DFs</title><p>Mouse DFs from C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Cell Biologics.

All samples subsequently sequenced had an RNA Integrity Number of &#x02265;8. The poly-A&#x02013;containing RNA transcripts in the total RNA samples were converted to cDNA and amplified after the Smart-seq2 method (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Sequencing libraries were made from the amplified cDNA samples using the Nextera kit (Illumina), assigning a unique barcode to each of the libraries to be sequenced together. The cDNA samples and libraries were examined on the Bioanalyzer (Agilent) DNA HS chips for size distribution and quantified by Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen). The RNA-Seq libraries were pooled together in equal amounts and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 Rapid Flowcell as single-end 75-nt reads following the standard protocol, giving a range of 15&#x02013;20 million reads per sample.
