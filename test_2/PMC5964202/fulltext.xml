The two methods are normally carried out step-wise and in a trial-and-error manner. Here we report a recombinase-based combinatorial method (termed &#x0201c;SCRaMbLE-in&#x0201d;) to tackle both challenges simultaneously. SCRaMbLE-in includes an in vitro recombinase toolkit to rapidly prototype and diversify gene expression at the pathway level and an in vivo genome reshuffling system to integrate assembled pathways into the synthetic yeast genome while combinatorially causing massive genome rearrangements in the host chassis. A set of loxP mutant pairs was identified to maximize the efficiency of the in vitro diversification. Exemplar pathways of &#x003b2;-carotene and violacein were successfully assembled, diversified, and integrated using this SCRaMbLE-in method. High-throughput sequencing was performed on selected engineered strains to reveal the resulting genotype-to-phenotype relationships.

In traditional metabolic engineering, metabolic analysis, substrate optimization, and direct genetic modification were often trial-and-error exercises<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, while synthetic biology provides an opportunity to engineer biology in a more standardized and rational fashion. With the continually dropping cost of DNA synthesis and innovation of DNA assembly methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, a wide range of metabolic pathways have been constructed and transformed to heterologous hosts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, introducing a new pathway into a host organism is likely to be accompanied with low production of desired compound molecules due to substrate or co-factor limitations; compromised growth of the host; or even toxicity to the host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. A number of methods have been developed to diversify the expression of heterologous pathways, such as the combinatorial assembly of gene expression units, genes expression regulation using CRISPR, protein engineering and pathway compartmentalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Despite all the progress that has been made, pathway optimization and chassis engineering remains time- and resource-intensive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. This is best illustrated by the heroic effort to engineer yeast to produce artemisinin, which required roughly 100 post-doc years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Site-specific recombinases are a family of DNA modifying enzymes that can recognize and drive recombination between two specific DNA sites to generate deletion, inversion, or integration of DNA fragments between the target sites. The well-studied Cre recombinase recognizes a 34&#x02009;bp loxP site and drives recombination without any co-factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The direction of the recombination site determines the type of recombination activity. Site-specific recombinase Cre has been widely applied to gene editing and genome engineering in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and the loxP site has also been engineered for better integration efficiency and cassette exchange purposes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Not only can Cre recombinase drive DNA recombination in vivo, it has also been purified and shown to function in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

Additionally, Chuang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> carried out an extensive mutant library screening, and identified novel rox sites, which can efficiently recombine with themselves in vivo but have minimal to no reactivity with wild-type (WT) rox sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Besides the expression level of the target genes, the choice of host and the genetic background of the host is of vital importance for heterologous pathway production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Repressing competing pathways and knocking out non-essential genes interacting with the target pathway can re-direct the precursor transformation fluxes in the metabolic maps or remove toxicity of side products to potentially achieve higher target production. However, refactoring the host genome could potentially impact fitness of the&#x000a0;cell, and genome-wide chassis optimization is still a daunting endeavor. Traditional mutagenesis and genome-editing technologies such as TALEN- and CRISPR/Cas9-based methods typically introduce a&#x000a0;limited number of site-specific mutation(s)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, but not large-scale genome-wide rearrangements such as inter- and intra-chromosomal translocations. In the synthetic yeast genome Sc2.0 project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.syntheticyeast.org">www.syntheticyeast.org</ext-link>), the SCRaMbLE system (Synthetic Chromosome Rearrangement and Modification by loxP-mediated Evolution) was designed to introduce genome-wide loxPsym sites and can generate a massive number of genome permutations upon induction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. SCRaMbLEing the synthetic yeast strains under selective conditions allows efficient directed evolution of desired phenotypes. With continuing successful synthesis and construction of these synthetic chromosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, the synthetic yeast is becoming a very attractive platform for metabolic engineering.</p><p id="Par6">In this study, we developed a recombinase-based toolkit &#x0201c;SCRaMbLE-in&#x0201d; to enable rapid metabolic engineering through pathway prototyping and chassis optimization in yeast. SCRaMbLE-in is composed of two steps, which can be used either independently or combined. The first step is to use purified recombinases in vitro to integrate regulatory elements into targeted pathways to diversify gene expression. The second step is to randomly integrate the assembled pathway into the synthetic yeast chromosomes through the SCRaMbLE-in process, which also causes large-scale genome rearrangements. The violacein and &#x003b2;-carotene pathway are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and simplicity of the SCRaMbLE-in method. We also demonstrate that the yield of both pathways can be further optimized with continuous genome SCRaMbLEing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design of the SCRaMbLE-in system</title><p id="Par7">Gene expression diversification and strain optimization are at the core of metabolic engineering. In order to achieve differentiated gene expression and chassis engineering simultaneously, a two-step diversification method was designed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schematic overview of the SCRaMbLE-in toolkit for metabolic engineering. Once designed, the synthetic pathway of interest will be rapidly prototyped in vitro. The pathway is pre-assembled in such&#x000a0;a way that all genes are assembled with respective regulatory elements, except that&#x000a0;one key gene is left &#x0201c;promoter-less&#x0201d;, having a recombination site upstream. Three&#x000a0;recombination systems, Cre-loxP, VCre-Vlox, and Dre-rox, were developed to integrate a range of promoters upstream to the key gene in the pathway. The assembled library is transformed into yeast and potentially productive pathways are selected and integrated in vivo in the next step. The selected productive pathways are flanked with a pair of loxPsym sites and can subsequently be integrated into the synthetic chromosomes through SCRaMbLE, and simultaneously the synthetic yeast chassis undergoes whole-genome rearrangement to result in strain optimization. The successful integrated strains will be profiled with mass spectrometry analysis and next-generation sequencing</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2018_4254_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e523"/></fig></p><p id="Par8">Firstly, an in vitro recombinase toolkit was designed to integrate a range of regulatory elements into the pathways of interest (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). In this step, regulatory elements such as promoters are flanked by the recombinase recognition sites in the same orientation. A single recombinase recognition site is engineered into the desired integration position of the pre-assembled pathway. In the case of promoter integration, the target site should be immediately upstream to the key enzyme-coding sequence. Three recombinases, Cre, VCre, and Dre, were purified for use in the integration step. The regulatory elements, selected recombinase and target pathway DNA are mixed in a single reaction, and the recombinase will integrate the regulatory elements into the&#x000a0;target recombination site to generate a combinatorially assembled pathway library. The library can then be transformed directly into the yeast for downstream screening and analysis.</p><p id="Par9">Secondly, a SCRaMbLE-in vector has been designed to integrate the target pathway into the synthetic genome through SCRaMbLE (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). In this vector, the target pathway DNA is flanked by the symmetric loxPsym sites. This will allow the Cre recombinase to integrate the target pathway into any loxPsym sites in the synthetic genome. Additionally, the active Cre will also mediate the rearrangement of the synthetic genome, through deletion, inversion, and duplication events, which act to diversify the host genetic background. With proper selection, the host canbe rapidly optimized to better accommodate the heterologous&#x000a0;pathway.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Quantification of the in vitro activity of recombinases</title><p id="Par10">To construct the in vitro recombinase toolkit, we first purified and quantified the activity of three tyrosine recombinases, Cre, Dre, and VCre. The proteins were tagged with C-terminal hexa-histidine tag and purified by nickel affinity chromatography, and subsequently assessed by SDS-PAGE and verified by MALDI peptide mass fingerprinting (Supplementary Fig.<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>, b). The test plasmids were designed as shown in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>. The recombinase will excise the DNA fragment flanked by its recognition sites (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), producing two circular DNA molecules that can be distinguished after ScaI digestion. Therefore, the activity of the recombinase can be monitored by measuring the successful production of the resulting recombined plasmids. We tested the activity of Cre and VCre against both of their recombination sites and found that the two recombinases are orthogonal to each other, i.e., Cre only recombines at the loxP sites and VCre only acts on the VloxP sites (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1e</xref>). Furthermore, Dre and VCre are also orthogonal to each other, while Dre has slight cross-activity on loxP sites and is thus not strictly orthogonal to Cre in vitro (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1e</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Recombinase and target sites</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Target site</th><th>Length</th><th>Site sequence</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cre</td><td>loxP</td><td>34&#x02009;bp</td><td>ATAACTTCGTATAGCATACATTATACGAAGTTAT</td></tr><tr><td>Dre</td><td>rox</td><td>32&#x02009;bp</td><td>TAACTTTAAATAATTGGCATTATTTAAAGTTA</td></tr><tr><td>VCre</td><td>Vlox</td><td>34&#x02009;bp</td><td>TCAATTTCCGAGAATGACAGTTCTCAGAAATTGA</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par11">To quantify the in vitro recombination efficiency, two strategies were designed to measure the excision and integration rates respectively (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d</xref>). The excision rate was assayed by monitoring the loss of an&#x000a0;<italic>RFP</italic> gene flanked by a pair of recombinase targeting sites in a reporter plasmid, and defined as the percentage&#x000a0;of white colonies on ampicillin selection medium after transforming the reaction mixture into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. To measure the integration rate, an accepting vector was constructed, which contains a kanamycin-resistance gene and a single recombination site. In addition, the above-mentioned reporter plasmid was modified to include a <italic>ccdB</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Upon recombinase treatment, if the excised <italic>RFP</italic> gene is inserted into the accepting vector, a red colony will be produced on kanamycin-containing medium. The presence of <italic>ccdB</italic> gene prevents the formation of red colonies due to co-transformation of the two original plasmids. The integration rate was defined as the percentage&#x000a0;of red colonies after kanamycin selection. As depicted in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1f</xref>, the excision rate of Cre-loxP system is over 40%, while VCre-Vlox and Dre-rox systems are slightly lower (about 30%). The relative integration rate is around 0.6% for Cre-loxP and Dre-rox and around 0.3% for VCre-Vlox (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1g</xref>). These results indicate that all three recombinases are active in vitro with slightly variable excision and integration rates.</p><p id="Par12">One potential explanation for the low integration rate might be the re-excision of <italic>RFP</italic> cassette&#x000a0;from the accepting vector. Therefore, using Cre-loxP as an example, we aimed to increase the rate by introducing mutations into the loxP sites at left or right palindromic arm, termed as left element (LE) and right element (RE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The loxP site containing both LE and RE could greatly reduce its affinity for the Cre recombinase and consequently preventing the integrated DNA from being excised (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Five loxP mutants, lox71, lox66, loxJT15, loxJT510, and loxJTZ17, which were reported to increase the integration rate in ES cells and <italic>E. coli</italic> were tested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Among them, loxJT15 and loxJT510 only have LE mutation, and loxJTZ17 only has RE mutation. Therefore, we constructed the RE mutation sites of loxJT15 and loxJT510 and the LE mutation site of loxJTZ17 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The in vitro excision assay was carried out both between the same&#x000a0;loxP mutant sites and between the LE:RE hybrid site and WT site. The result&#x000a0;of&#x000a0;quantification is summarized in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>. In general, we observed that the excision rates of cognate recombination site pairs were higher than that of LE:RE&#x02013;WT pairs, which suggests the LE/RE strategy is also applicable in vitro (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Interestingly, loxJTZ17-containing hybrid sites showed the lowest excision rate when recombined with the loxP site, while loxJTZ17 yielded high recombination rate with itself, making it the best candidate for integration improvement. After examining the integration rate, we found that the hybrid site of loxJTZ17 and loxJT15 performs the best, leading to about a three-fold increase relative to the WT site (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Hence the loxJT15 and loxJTZ17 pair was chosen for next-step application of promoter integration.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Integration rate improvement by LE/RE strategy. <bold>a</bold> LE/RE strategy was used to improve the integration efficiency. The functional domains of a recombination site are divided as a spacer region and two palindromic regions. The recombination between LE and RE mutation site generates a LE:RE double-mutant site and a wild-type loxP site. For in vitro application, a genetic Element of Interest (EoI) flanked by two LE sites&#x000a0;is first excised out, and then integrates into an RE site, finally&#x000a0;being flanked by a LE/RE site and a loxP site. <bold>b</bold> Excision rate quantification of palindromic mutant site pairs (LE&#x02013;LE or RE&#x02013;RE) and double-mutant site and loxP site (LE:RE-loxP).

We have previously reported the construction and characterization of a standardized yeast parts library called YeastFab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. To match our in vitro recombinase toolkit with the YeastFab library, several standardizations of the tool plasmids were made. An <italic>RFP</italic> expressing unit flanked by two YeastFab matched type IIs restriction sites was included in the loader to facilitate the loading of standardized elements from YeastFab by Golden Gate assembly and an <italic>URA3</italic> marker was used for selection in yeast (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b</xref>).

Two exemplar pathways, the &#x003b2;-carotene and violacein synthesis pathways, were selected as demonstration. We selected <italic>CrtI</italic>, the critical gene to transform the colorless phytoene to lycopene in &#x003b2;-carotene synthesis, and <italic>VioA</italic>, the key starting gene transforming <sc>L</sc>-tryptophan to violacein, as target genes to test promoter integration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, c</xref>).

The library was then transformed into yeast strain BY4741 and selected on SC-His-Ura plates, which produced yeast colonies of different intensities of orange/yellow colors as well as differing colony sizes, indicating varying yields of carotenoid (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). The integration of the promoter was confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and the fitness and chemical analysis of several selected variants were further compared (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, d</xref>). The yield of carotenoid lycopene and &#x003b2;-carotene were quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry&#x000a0;(LC-MS) and the activity of the integrated promoters was also compared. The result shows that the carotenoid production is not proportional to the activity of the promoters. The medium promoter pACT1 integrated strain have a similar carotenoid yield with pTDH3, while pRPL22B integrated strains have the lowest &#x003b2;-carotene yield even though it is not the weakest promoter (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).

For example, the low yield strain with pYPT1 and pRPL22B have longer doubling time and lower saturation cell densities while the high yield strain with pTDH3, pHSP12, and pACT1 have shorter doubling times and higher saturation point. Although the production levels in strains with pSTE2 or pHXK1 were quite different, the fitness for the two strains is similar. Such fitness differences could be the result of metabolic burden from the intermediates of &#x003b2;-carotene pathway and the flux could be affected by promoter choice.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>In vitro pathway prototying of &#x003b2;-carotene and violacein pathways. <bold>a</bold> Illustration of gene function in &#x003b2;-carotene synthesis pathway. <italic>CrtI</italic> was chosen as the target gene for integration regulation in &#x003b2;-carotene pathway. <italic>CrtI</italic> encodes the desaturase that converts the colorless phytoene to the yellow neurosporene first and then to the red lycopene through four desaturation reactions.

Whole-chromosome duplication was identified in LWy239 and its derived strains LWy260 and LWy261. One possible explanation that the SCRaMbLE process somehow interferes with&#x000a0;the synthetic chromosome segregation process, resulting in one daughter cell with aneuploidy.

This fusion event leads to the presence of two centromeres in this chromosome, with one of which inverted (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12b</xref>). This is supported by the sequencing, PCR and PFGE results (Supplementary Fig.<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12c, d</xref>). The segregation process of this chromosome during cell cycle will be worth studying further, and presumably, one of the centromeres is defective. Considering the complex genotype variations in these strains, it is still difficult to isolate the key variation, or comprehensive effects from numerous variations.

In the past decades, synthetic biology has been widely used in the design, modification and assembly of genetic elements, significantly speeding up the metabolic engineering process, and succeeding in the production of several important metabolites. Recently, great progress has been made in the yeast synthetic genome project&#x02014;Sc2.0. Six synthetic chromosomes have been successfully synthesized and all are functional in vivo. The synthesized yeast genome offers a unique platform to perform the rapid strain engineering methods such as the SCRaMbLE-in methodologies described in this paper. SCRaMbLEing the synthetic yeast has been proved to be able to generate various genotypes and phenotypes through Cre-mediated rearrangements utilizing the implanted loxPsym sites. In this study, a rapid, efficient, and universal method called SCRaMbLE-in was designed and demonstrated to be a new method to fast track the cycle of engineering biology, presenting a new synergy area between synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.</p><p id="Par25">Combinatorial assembly has been instrumental in synthetic biology for exploring a large design space. Broadly speaking, there are two categories of combinatorial assembly methods: one is based on complementary overhang sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, and the other one is using homologous bridging sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. The SCRaMbLE-in utilizes site-specific recombinases to achieve efficient combinatorial library construction, and provides an alternative method to diversify metabolic pathways. It is sequence-independent and can be applied to virtually any parts and pathways. The SCRaMbLE-in method also allows random integration of the pathway into&#x000a0;a genomic locus, and at the same time optimize the host Sc2.0 strain, which are not possible with any existing combinatorial methods.</p><p id="Par26">In the SCRaMbLE-in method, the gene expression diversification, pathway integration, and chassis evolution processes were tackled conveniently through our in vitro recombinase toolkit and in vivo synthetic genome SCRaMbLE-in system. The SCRaMbLE-in method not only allows researchers to integrate pathways into the synthetic yeast genome, but also allows the genetic background to be evolved and selected. In addition to the genetic background, the location of integration could affect the transcription efficiency depending on chromatin structure and the degree of heterochromatinization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Moreover, the scattered cis-acting elements and other not fully characterized untranslated regions can also make a difference to&#x000a0;pathway expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Though some genomic loci have been studied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, the majority of the&#x000a0;genome remains uncharacterized. The combinatorial nature of the SCRaMbLE-in method allows researchers to explore a large, diversified, genetic space for the optimal design(s). Additionally, the genome-integration feature allows the stable presence of a pathway without generating extra burden of plasmid maintenance in the host. When the heterologous pathway imposes cellular burden to the host, SCRaMbLE provides a unique opportunity for the host to evolve and to adapt to&#x000a0;these challenges.</p><p id="Par27">No single strain can serve as a super host for multiple diverse products. Even when a strain is optimized for the production of one class of compound, this rarely translates to enhanced production from different pathways, and so for each target, a lengthy and costly trial-and-error process of strain engineering is required to optimize production. The SCRaMbLE-in method we report here will explore the synthetic yeast, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> 2.0 (Sc2.0), as a generic platform for heterologous production of multiple valuable natural products. SCRaMbLE induces genome-wide sequence duplication, deletion, inversion, and translocation, but does not introduce point mutations. Such that it is possible to couple SCRaMbLE with traditional random mutagenesis methods, and recently developed high-throughput genome-wide site-directed mutagenesis methods such as MAGE and RAGE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par28">In our method, pathway SCRaMbLE-in and chassis evolution are achieved in&#x000a0;the same step and continuous SCRaMbLE could be applied to further evolve the strains. This makes it particularly attractive for long-term directed evolution experiments using either batch transfer or chemostats. The pathway SCRaMbLE-in vector can serve as a generic tool to integrate virtually any pathway of interest into the synthetic yeast platform. With the merging of multiple synthetic chromosomes and the complete synthesis of the whole yeast genome in near future, the SCRaMbLE-in method will have more use cases to explore.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Protein expression</title><p id="Par29">A single colony of <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3), transformed with either the Cre, Dre, or VCre protein expression plasmid, was transferred into 10&#x02009;mL LB media, supplemented with 100&#x02009;mg/L kanamycin and incubated overnight at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C with shaking, 180&#x02009;r.p.m. The overnight pre-culture was then inoculated into 1&#x02009;L of LB medium with 100&#x02009;mg/L kanamycin and incubated at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C with 180&#x02009;r.p.m. shaking.
