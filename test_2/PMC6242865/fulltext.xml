Two long-read sequencing technologies, from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), are commercially available. Oxford Nanopore sequencers measure changes in ionic current when the DNA fragments translocate through protein nanopores in a semi-synthetic insulated membrane. Because the detection process does not require enzyme-based nucleotide incorporation and detection of fluorescent signals, ONT sequencing read length is theoretically only limited by the length of the DNA fragment translocating through the pore. Consequently, sequences &#x0003e;2&#x02009;Mbps in length have been reported. This read length advantage is partially offset by the fact that individual raw sequencing reads tend to have higher error rates than second-generation sequencing reads, thus requiring sequence correction and post-assembly sequence polishing to generate high-quality sequencing data. Shortly after its inception, studies have shown that the ONT technology could be used for assembling microbial genomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Continuous improvements in chemistry, base calling, and sequencing throughputs have recently allowed researchers to use the technology for producing high-quality whole genome assemblies for larger genomes, in combination with Illumina sequencing reads, in species such as human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and the wild tomato species <italic>Solanum pennellii</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Numerous genomic assembly projects, including maize<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and <italic>Aegilops tauschii</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, have generated chromosome-scale scaffolds when combining long-read PacBio sequences with complementary long-range scaffolding technologies, such as Bionano Genomics optical maps or Hi-C proximity ligation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The optical mapping technology developed by Bionano Genomics has been used in genome sequencing projects to provide contig sequence validation, error correction, and high-level scaffolding resulting in significant increases in contiguity and quality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Recently, Bionano Genomics introduced a new labeling concept, called Direct Label and Stain (DLS). In DLS, the Direct Labeling Enzyme 1 (DLE-1) attaches a single fluorophore to specific sequence motifs. Unlike previous labeling strategies, which were based on nicking endonucleases, DLS does not create damage in DNA at specific sites, thus avoiding the loss of DNA information and truncation due to fragile sites, resulting in a significant increase in continuity. Most tested complex genomes yield 50&#x02013;100 times higher maps N<sub>50</sub> than those generated using an endonuclease approach, often leading to the assembly of full chromosome arms or even entire chromosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Chromosome-scale assemblies of repeat-rich plant genomes could be used for many applications, including the study of structural variations in large regions, expected recombination frequencies in specific regions, target sequence characterization and modification for gene editing, or genomic characterization of transgenic material.

Sorghum represents an economically important staple crop&#x02014;it is the third most produced cereal crop in the US, and its adaptability to drought and high temperatures has made it a preferred crop to grow in semi-arid regions. While its genome, at ~730&#x02009;Mbps, is smaller than other more complex crop genomes such as maize (~2.3&#x02009;Gbps)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> or soybean (~1.2&#x02009;Gbps)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, its high repeat content (~61%) and presence of large transposon structures makes it an attractive model for testing the effectiveness of the ONT chemistry for overall correctness and contiguity of a complex plant genome assembly. In addition, a reference genome has been produced via Sanger sequencing for genotype <italic>BTx623</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, making it a valuable resource for the direct evaluation of the ONT-based assembly.

Prior to library construction, short-read DNA fragments were generated after shearing DNA to ~8&#x02009;Kbps with a g-TUBE (Covaris), while long-read DNA fragments were generated after size-selecting un-sheared DNA to 20&#x02009;Kbps and above with a PippinHT system (Sage Science).

The resulting fast5 files were processed using the Albacore base caller (version 2.0.1).

Results (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) indicated that, expectedly, increased coverage and increased read length both led to higher contiguity of the assembly, and that low (~30&#x000d7;) coverage sequencing of a complex plant genome should mainly focus on sequencing long DNA fragments (&#x0003e;20&#x02009;Kbps) for a contiguous assembly.

DLS optical maps were used in the present study. Because labeling occurs directly without introducing nicks in the DNA strands, the average length and overall N<sub>50</sub> of DLS optical maps tend to be significantly longer than the ones obtained using nicking enzymes, which further facilitated correcting, orienting, and scaffolding of the ONT contigs. Alignments of the DLS optical maps generated in this study to the <italic>S. bicolor</italic> reference genome showed that their sizes are mostly limited by the size of chromosomes. With sufficient sequencing coverage, ultra-long ONT reads (including reads over 1&#x02009;Mbp in length) may represent a useful complement to DLS optical maps. Similar N<sub>50</sub> values as the one obtained here have been predicted in human when using ultra-long ONT sequencing reads at ~30&#x000d7; sequencing coverage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par31">The <italic>Tx430</italic> annotation exhibits good congruency with the public v3.0.1 <italic>BTx623</italic> annotation.

Therefore, the increased number and shorter median length of <italic>Tx430</italic> protein-coding genes, whose structure could be further refined through alignments and comparisons with deep transcriptome assemblies derived from <italic>Tx430</italic> RNA-Seq datasets, might be related to the presence of genes absent from the <italic>BTx623</italic> genome, but also to the presence of short indels and mismatches remaining in the final <italic>Tx430</italic> hybrid assembly.

Despite those observations, the current state of the assembly confirms that working-draft assemblies can be achieved rapidly for large and complex plant genomes using long-read nanopore sequencing technologies, and chromosome-scale scaffolding of those working draft assemblies can be achieved through DLS optical mapping technologies. These results have multiple implications. First, by greatly enhancing the contiguity of ONT assemblies, DLS optical maps are expected to greatly facilitate comparative genomics studies at the chromosomal level, and therefore accelerate pan-genomic analysis between multiple genotypes in a species of interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Pericentromeric inversions, such as the ones detected on chromosome 9, could impact marker detection and recombination in a breeding program involving parental lines distinguished structurally by such inversions. Contig sizes attained in this study also could facilitate the direct comparison of regions involved in specific traits of interest, such as disease-resistance gene clusters. Second, sequences in this study were generated using the USB-sized MinION sequencer. Its overall portability means that informative whole-genome assemblies can now be attained in multiple settings and locations that, up until recently, did not have the means and resources to generate such assemblies. The de novo assembly of a complex plant genome also could be greatly accelerated by the adoption of larger ONT sequencing platforms, including the PromethION where up to 48 flow cells, each generating more than 100&#x02009;Gbps of data, can be run simultaneously. This could have a remarkable impact on how genomes are being determined and defined in the world of agricultural biotechnology, by allowing the rapid characterization, for example, of mutagenized lines or of transgene insertions, or by facilitating the design of multiple gene editing targets and allowing the direct prediction of potential off-target mutations in a large number of transformed plants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Plant material and genomic DNA extraction</title><p id="Par33">Whole leaves were sampled from <italic>S. bicolor</italic> accession <italic>Tx430</italic> grown in the greenhouse for approximately 2 months.
