Unlike Mendelian disorders caused by a single genetic defect, most complex diseases such as diabetes or coronary heart disease rely on multiple genetic variants and their exposure to&#x02014;and interaction with&#x02014;social and environmental factors. Contemporary GWAS combine data from participants across multiple data sets in the form of a meta-analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> to analyze millions of these variants. Discoveries have led to clinical findings from diseases such as breast cancer and Alzheimer&#x02019;s to anthropometric and behavioral traits, with momentum moving from the study of association to biological function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Although excellent narrative reviews document the scientific contributions of GWAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, there has been no systematic scientometric study as yet. Such a study is crucial for researchers, data providers, editors, and consortiums working in this area to understand the strengths and potential gaps in current research and is essential to plan future investments in data collection and science policy for funders, research bodies, and national governments. Furthermore, research evaluations and funding exercises increasingly rely on scientometric rankings of author productivity, such as the <italic>H</italic>-index to measure the productivity and impact of scientists. Funders and national governments also strive to find useable metrics to trace the impact and usage of their scientific investments (such as large data collection infrastructures or investment in scientists). They also endeavor to measure whether policies to enact change have been realized. This includes initiatives such as the National Institute of Health&#x02019;s (NIH) Revitalization Act, for instance, which mandates the inclusion of minorities as subjects. Most funding bodies and Universities have likewise noted lower levels of women and ethnic minorities in senior biomedical positions and implemented policies to counteract these trends, but there are limited metrics for evaluation across the genomic landscape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">We first study participant demographics, sample sizes, ancestry, the geographic distribution of participant recruitment, the number and <italic>p</italic> values of genetic associations, journal diversity, and disease focus. We draw on over 13 years of GWAS discoveries (March 2005 to October 2018) from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog (hereafter, the Catalog) produced by the US National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) in conjunction with the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. We then link the Catalog to external PubMed and United Nations (UN) population data and manually curate the most frequently used data sets, which cover over 85% of all GWAS by cumulative sample size across approximately a third of all papers. We rank and map top funders by ancestry and disease, isolate key consortiums, engage in an analysis of gender and authorship, create a unique GWAS <italic>H</italic>-Index and undertake a social network analysis of author centrality.

This ranges from the most common term of European, to hybrid terms such as Caucasian Eastern Mediterranean along with multiple other examples of polyvocality. Our accompanying replication material provides a more empirically transparent and rigorous evidence base compared with previous research that reported that around a fifth of papers use classification schemes in logically ambiguous ways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and estimates that there were up to 26 terms to describe participants of African ancestry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">This decomposition of the free text field also allows us to examine categorizations of Native or Indigenous populations.

We show that 71.80% of participants are recruited from only three countries; the US, UK, and Iceland. Although participants from the United States are most frequently the basis for the largest number of studies (41.01% of all studies), the United Kingdom dominates in terms of the number of participants (40.50% of all participants) analyzed. Conversely, although 1.13% of recorded studies involve Icelandic participants, the small Icelandic population (around 334,000) represents 11.52% of all participants contributed to GWAS research. In terms of the ratio of the number of observations contributed by a country relative to the population of the country<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, Iceland is by far the largest (19.13), followed by the United Kingdom (0.32). Note that owing to the way in which data on recruitment from multiple countries is curated, these numbers can only be used to compare between countries, rather than in absolute terms.

The most frequently used data sets have several key distinguishing features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. First, echoing our geographic analysis, frequently used data are from industrialized countries (Netherlands, US, UK, Ireland, Germany, Iceland), which share similar rates of disease prevalence and population profiles. Second, most engaged in random probability or population sampling to gain as representative a sample as possible, something that is not characteristic of emerging large data sets such as the healthy, older and higher socioeconomic status participants in the UK Biobank<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> or direct-to-consumer genetic data. Third, they are cohorts that are deeply and richly phenotyped across many diseases, future-proofing them for multiple needs. Fourth, many are older populations with disease diagnosis aimed at unraveling the pathways to disease and disability in old age. In this respect, they miss the longer-term development of disease and intervention possibilities that an asymptomatic younger population might afford (except for the 1958 British Birth Cohort or additional data collection in cohorts such as the FHS). Fifth, they are all prospective longitudinal data sets, following individuals or birth cohorts over a longer period, thus facilitating a life-course approach to understanding the pathways to certain diseases, disability, and mortality. Sixth, all but one of these cohorts is comprised of predominantly female participants (ranging from 48 to 100%). This sex ratio imbalance is rarely addressed, yet sexual dimorphism or sex differences in disease are highly relevant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.

This figure increases to 29.3% when filtering for authorships in the field of Molecular and Cell Biology (and to 32.4% for the specific subdiscipline of Human Genomics). Our estimate of 36.97% is higher than these figures, and even more so when compared with the historical average of women undertaking research in Molecular and Cell Biology (20.7% between 1665 and 1989).</p><p id="Par17">We build on work showing the historical under-representation of women in the first and last authorship positions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Our analysis shows that 44.04% of the authors in the first author or junior position are female: substantially higher than the all positions estimate.

This is potentially owig&#x000a0;to a historic gender imbalance in educational attainment in scientific fields, with fewer women obtaining doctorates in the past than today. We found similar average GWAS-Indexes for female (4.85) and male (5.34) authors and compared the average number of papers published by females (6.15) and males (7.17) and the average number of citations (648.44 for females, 780.73 for males). Finally, we examined whether there are gender differences across the most frequently studied EFO terms. Here, we find a striking concentration of female authorship in studies of Breast Carcinoma (51.0%), whereas male authors are concentrated on Schizophrenia and Type 2 Diabetes with only 31.0% and 33.0% female authorships, respectively (with these numbers almost wholly invariant as to how we split the EFO terms in the Catalog).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Funders: US and UK dominate</title><p id="Par18">To understand geographic concentration, we examined the funding sources of research. Using the PubMed database, we find a total of 136 different funding agencies, with funding being spread across a total of 12,790 unique Grant IDs. Each study has an average of 13.52 contributing grants. We measure each unique grant contributing to one study (PubMed ID) as one acknowledgment with the five most frequently acknowledged funders being: NHLBI NIH HHS (National Heart, Lung &#x00026; Blood Institute; 25.88%), NCI NIH HHS (National Cancer Institute; 10.64%), NIA NIH HHS (National Institute on Aging; 8.37%), MRC UK (Medical Research Council; 7.21%), and NIMH NIH HHS (National Institute of Mental Health; 5.50%).

Recommendation One is that researchers, editors, funders, and commercial companies prioritize the inclusion of multiple types of diversity in data, namely: ancestral, geographical, environmental, temporal and demographic, and recognize the impact that this lack of diversity has on research findings. First, ancestral diversity needs to increase beyond the replication phase to include more non-European ancestry populations. Significantly extending previous comparisons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, we show that diversity levels fluctuated markedly. Following the full release of the UK Biobank and increased reliance on large direct-to-consumer data, we predict that diversity in GWAS ancestry may decrease even further, given that 94.23% of the 488,377-genotyped UK Biobank participants are in the white ethnic group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> and 23andMe has a sample with 77% European ancestry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par22">The benefits of increased ancestral diversity are multiple; GWAS that utilize data from diverse populations will provide more accurately targeted therapeutic treatments to more of the world&#x02019;s population, extend insights into the architecture of traits and uncover rare variants with significant effect sizes, which replicate across ancestries. Isolated populations&#x02013;owing to bottleneck events, genetic drift, adaptation, and selection&#x02013;are of importance owing to higher frequencies of rare variants, which increase the power to detect associations with clinically important phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Discovery is often boosted in populations with high rates of homozygosity such as those with a tradition of consanguineous marriage. A recent study of exomes of British Pakistani adults with high parental relatedness, for instance, discovered rare-variant homozygous genotypes that predicted &#x0201c;knockouts&#x0201d; (loss of gene function) in hundreds of genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">Although the focus has primarily been on increasing ancestral diversity, we also call for an expansion of both geographical and environmental diversity. Although ~&#x02009;76.2% of the current world population reside in Asia or Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, we estimate that 72% of genetic discoveries emanate from participants recruited from only three countries (US, UK, Iceland). By examining only genotype&#x02013;phenotype associations, GWAS have largely ignored the fact that complex traits have a strong geographical component involving genetic predisposition and environmental exposure. There is little reflection on how environmental variation or Gene&#x02013;Environment (G&#x000d7;E) interaction impacts results or even shapes the traits that are prioritized for research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. The US, UK, and Iceland have distinct histories and social systems that have fundamentally shaped exposure to certain disease factors or traits. Those predisposed to obesity for instance, face radically different environmental stimuli in the US than in other nations. Or, those with a higher genetic predisposition to skin cancer would have their risk exacerbated if they resided in areas with higher sunlight exposure. GWAS regularly combine data sets from vastly different countries and historical periods with little recognition of the consequences, implicitly assuming the impact of genetic loci on traits is universal across time and place. A recent study shows that for complex traits, a large proportion of genetic effects are hidden or watered-down when disparate data across different countries and historical periods are combined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par24">We also advocate an increased temporal diversity of individuals across different birth cohorts, historical periods and life-course stages. We estimate that the most frequently used data sets are disproportionately populated by older individuals, yet the prevalence and measurement of disease varies considerably with age. There is only a moderate positive correlation between midlife and old-age measures for body mass index, glucose, and systolic blood pressure, for instance, which all increase with age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Samples of older individuals also suffer from mortality selection and exclude a non-random subset of the population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. This issue is compounded by healthy volunteer selection and participants with a high socioeconomic status, both of which occur disproportionately in prominent large data sets such as the UK Biobank<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Finally, we call for more discussion related to the gender diversity of GWAS participants, particularly regarding specific diseases as there is growing evidence of sexual dimorphism in traits linked to obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, reproduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, and others.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Recommendation Two: monitoring with funding consequences</title><p id="Par25">Beyond policy formation regarding diversity or gaps in research to intensive monitoring with consequences for funding.

There is a danger that the inability to apply polygenic scores from European ancestry studies to other groups is misinterpreted to reflect biological differences between different ethnic or racial groups. This misnomer was carefully discussed, for instance, in a recent GWAS of educational attainment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Genetic variation needs to be distinguished from the social, cultural, and political meanings ascribed to different human groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Race is not a biological category, as genetic variation is traced to geographical locations and does not map into our perpetually evolving and socially defined racial or ethnic groups.

Populations are the product of repeated mixtures over tens of thousands of years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

There are encouraging endeavors to increase genotyping outside of North America and Europe such as the African Genome Variation Project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Many projects that collect non-European samples have funding from large research bodies such as the NIH or Wellcome Trust, granted primarily to researchers working in those countries. The danger, however, is that helicopter science&#x02014;collecting and then exporting genetic data&#x02014;may compound existing inequalities, with participants and researchers from those countries not being the main benefactors. African researchers have recently noted that many have accepted restrictive terms offered by foreign partners owing to a lack of resources to handle large genomic data sets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. We recommend the inclusion of meaningful local intellectual contributions and, if required (in addition to data collection), the supply of training, computational resources, and infrastructure development to enable local scientists to build the capacity to work independently.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Recommendation Five: action to reduce inequalities in authorship and investigators</title><p id="Par28">We estimate that women author on average fewer GWAS papers, have fewer citations than men, are more frequently junior first authors and less frequently senior authors. The latter observation is remarkably similar to NIH figures, where women constitute only 30% of principal investigators on grants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. This suggests a relationship between acting as a senior author and functioning as a PI on grants and may contribute to women&#x02019;s lower peer review scores on funding panels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The NIH has established initiatives such as the Women in Biomedical Careers Working Group and the 2017 Next Generation Research Initiative. Policies such as these which target early career researchers are more likely to reach this goal since these groups are more often more ethnically diverse and populated by a higher percent of women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Female researchers themselves need to be cognizant of these disparities, as should those who conduct research appraisals and funding reviews.</p><p id="Par29">We were unable to control for maternity or care leaves, which may have a role in productivity and serving as a PI, particularly in some European countries where women may take up to 1 year leave<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. This echoes recent findings that women had a lower longevity in funding, witnessed by a lower likelihood to renew projects, lower submission rates, and lower funding per year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Women face distinct work-life reconciliation issues and may require additional mentoring and support to encourage them to submit and renew applications or serve as a PI. Increased gender diversity in science may also lead to fundamentally new discoveries. That can have real clinical consequences: consider for instance that symptoms of cardiac arrest in women were ignored and misdiagnosed for decades. This has been attributed to the notion that coronary disease was considered a male only health concern, largely studied in male subjects by male scientists.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Recommendation Six: reform incentive structures that intertwine the role of authorship, data ownership, and dating sharing</title><p id="Par30">GWAS demand collaboration through the formation of large consortiums, resulting in multiple authorships. As illustrated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. and Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), large samples are required owing to the relatively small effect sizes, with the number of detected associations typically increasing with sample size. Central authors within the GWAS network are the holders of large longitudinal data sets or those who lead large consortiums, with many top GWAS scientists classified as hyperprolific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. We reinforce the necessity of conventions related to author transparency in contributions, such as via the Vancouver Regulations which describe the contributions of individual authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. With hundreds of authors, full transparency and reporting remains a challenge. A related suggestion could be to distinguish between authors and contributors who provide data. Another could be to provide data producers with a 6&#x02013;12-month grace period before making data publicly available to similarly interested researchers. This, however, has the potential to generate its own incentive-based anomalies and pressures.</p><p id="Par31">These solutions, however, do not align with current incentive and reward structures. When the PI and participating researchers are evaluated, it occurs at the individual level. In the UK&#x02019;s national Research Excellence Framework (which ranks departments and institutions according to research excellence), for instance, authorship is a key return. To remove individuals from GWAS authorship demands a broader discussion of incentive systems applicable to data generators. Some observers argue that the authorships of scientists who obtained the funding, designed the study, supervised staff and students, and often supervise data collection and analyses should be removed. Yet, without such labor-intensive endeavors, GWAS would not exist. We also call for the careful application of research metrics such as the H-Index, particularly when comparing scientists and academics across scientific disciplines. As a leading GWAS author and holder of one of the most used GWAS data sets carefully warns: &#x0201c;&#x02026;for comparing these authorships across different scientific disciplines (biomedical and beyond) I think we should revisit this issue with a critical appraisal to create a better understanding among fellow scientists&#x0201d;.

Even in the most eminent journals, descriptions of data were cryptic and sources unclear or untraceable, raising issues of transparency and reproducibility of research.

However, the implementation of DOIs for common data sets, and the encouraged use of ORCID iDs for authors&#x02014;in the same way that PubMed IDs identify papers and EFO terms represent experimental variables&#x02014;would enable better scientometrics and a more accurate reflection of genomic science.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Recommendation Eight: coordinated governance from multiple stakeholders</title><p id="Par33">There have been repeated calls to remove barriers and increase trans-border cooperation, such as UNESCO&#x02019;s reiteration that it is a human right to benefit from shared scientific advancements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. There are striking differences in national regulations for data sharing and a patchwork of Institutional Review Board (IRB) positions. International models of genomic data sharing do exist, such as those pioneered by the International Cancer Genome Consortium. A recent evaluation of genomics data sharing across multiple countries reveals complexity, contradiction, and confusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. Data transfer to third countries outside of China, for instance, is prohibitive owing to overlapping and complex data regulations. The US has a fragmented data protection regime with oversight across IRBs and data access committees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Europe&#x02019;s recent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) brought new restrictions related to the transfer of data across borders, complicated by additional unique country&#x02013;and institutional&#x02013;specific interpretations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. An international genomics group could create a more transparent code of conduct and shape the interpretation of GDPR&#x02019;s rules. Closely related to this is the further development of the regulatory protection and data sharing across borders in relation to cloud based storage providers. Those who store the data are dependent on cloud providers who often shift data across geographical locations with limited notification or oversight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Recommendation Nine: enforce the sharing of GWAS summary results</title><p id="Par34">Just as data can serve as a valuable commodity, so can summary results. Although such sharing is a requirement of many major journals, it remains a policy gray area and they are regularly not released, even after directly contacting authors. Others share only when co-authorship is granted. An effective deterrent could be the&#x000a0;threat of retraction of the article unless summary results are shared or prohibiting applications or granting future funding until past discoveries are made publicly available.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Recommendation Ten: utilize influence for the good of more people</title><p id="Par35">Our last recommendation highlights the fact that data sharing, ethics, and transparency is frequently discussed with the implicit assumption that funders, ethics boards, and universities are the only bodies with the power to govern this ecosystem. But what if researchers do not need funding or operate outside of universities and their incentive systems? The growth of direct-to-consumer companies such as 23andMe and biomedical companies, many of whom hold the largest genomic data sets, often fall outside of regulations of funders or universities. By virtue of their position, data sharing, and release of results often follow different rules than publicly funded data sets. Some impose the restricted release of GWAS summary statistics (i.e., the information that is used by other researchers to create polygenic scores and additional analyses). Considering the recent sales of blocks of direct-to-consumer data to pharmaceutical companies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>, scientific collaboration also has the potential to be restricted. Although commercial genomics companies generally operate with different demands and incentive structures, most still require external validation of their results published in top scientific journals, placing editors, and journals in a key position of power. We conclude thus by calling upon all parties in the genomics ecosystem to utilize their influence for the good of more people as part of the ongoing genomic revolution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par36">Our systematic scientometric review of genomic discovery quantifies multiple known and unknown assumptions about this domain. We observe considerable fluctuation in the ancestral diversity of participants over time. By ranking the most frequently used data sets, we also went beyond ancestral diversity to show other types of selectivity. We mapped the geographical recruitment of GWAS participants and core funders by ancestry and disease coverage, explored gender disparities in authorship and provided evidence of a tightly knit social network of researchers and consortiums. A central finding was that our results once again emphasized the potential for a cycle of disadvantage for underrepresented communities and despite continued efforts, infusing diversity into genomics remains challenging.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Code availability</title><p id="Par37">A full standalone GitHub repository (github.com/crahal/GWASReview), which predominantly runs off a Jupyter Notebook and supporting functions accompanies this article as Replication Material.
