We then discuss the parasitic disease targets that have been subject to fragment-based screening.</p><p>There has been a realization that 3D shape and sp<sup>3</sup> richness may be better starting points for drugs [<xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref>] and, likewise, in fragment-based drug discovery efforts are being made to include these features into Fragment Screening Libraries [<xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]. Methods of chemical synthesis of fragments hits based on natural product-like compounds follow well-established principles of fragment-linking and fragment-growing. Tractability is enhanced by the small size and reduced complexity of fragment hits based on natural product-like compounds compared to synthetic challenges associated with larger natural products.</p><p>While the construction of libraries has been historically uneven in its exploration of chemical space [<xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>], there has been only limited use of the incorporation of natural products into Fragment Libraries. Natural products are enriched with biosynthetic intermediates and endogenous metabolites resulting from being exposed to long selection processes. Natural products encode areas of chemical space explored by nature in evolution [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]. Natural products have an embedded recognition of protein binding sites captured during their biosynthesis [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref>].</p><p>A fragment&#x02019;s effect on proteins is often too weak to be measured (affinity in the 0.1&#x02013;10 mM range) using standard assays. The screening stage of FBDD requires the use of biophysical techniques significantly more sensitive than the methods utilized in HTS. There are sensitive techniques that are used in the FBDD such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), native mass spectrometry (NMS), computational approaches, thermal shift assay, and computational approaches.</p><p>A recent bibliographic technique identified 3,642 publications on FBDD between 1953 and 2016 [<xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>]. The bibliographic analysis was based on keywords. Natural products showed up in the top 100 keywords; however, anti-parasitic did not appear, with the major disease-related keywords including cancer, apoptosis, kinase inhibitor, alzheimer&#x02019;s diseases beta-secretase and gpcr [<xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>]. The various techniques in fragment-based discovery were, in highest to lowest order, X-ray crystallography, surface plasmon resonance, nuclear magnetic resonance, thermal shift assay, isothermal titration calorimetry, mass spectrometry [<xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>]. It was noted that keywords may not perfectly reflect the usage of the techniques as keywords tend to reflect identifiers used by authors to attract the targeted audience [<xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><label>2.</label><title>Approaches to develop fragment-based libraries either using natural products or natural product-like compounds</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><label>2.1.</label><title>Chemical disassembly of larger natural products</title><p><italic>In silico</italic> guided chemical disassembly of larger natural products has been developed as an approach to a natural product library [<xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref>].

The logic and algorithm used was a scaffold tree approach, whereby identification of the scaffold was undertaken by removal of terminal chains and ring substituents followed by deconstruction, by removing rings and bonds successively following a set of prioritization rules ensuring linear deconstruction giving one fragment at each step. Thus, directly attached functional groups are kept intact, side chains are shortened, and ring systems are deconstructed in a stepwise manner. Side chains with lengths of up to two atoms are retained, and carbon chains longer than two atoms are pruned after the second atom from the ring. Where the second atom is a heteroatom, pruning will occur after the first following carbon. Carbonyl groups are treated as a single heteroatom. For rings separated by a linker, the connection is pruned and each substructure is then processed separately. The position and type of substitution are therefore retained as in the guiding natural product, and functional groups are differentiated. As fragments may not have a high Fsp<sup>3</sup> or 3D shape, an NP-likeness score was subsequently calculated [<xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref>] to give 2,000 clusters of natural product derived fragments with structural diversity. The generation of fragments (<bold>16</bold>&#x02013;<bold>19</bold>) from renieramycin is shown in <xref rid="F0005">Figure 4</xref> [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]. The fragment (<bold>20</bold>) from a cluster, where <bold>21</bold> was the cluster center, was identified as weak inhibitors of p38&#x003b1; MAP kinase with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 1.3 mM. Synthetic elaboration and subsequent co-crystal structures with the protein revealed an allosteric pocket of p38&#x003b1; MAP kinase as novel class of type III inhibitors (<xref rid="F0004">Figure 5</xref>) [<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>].

Based on the previous study [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>], synthetic programs yielded collections of NP-inspired compounds.

When serine is abundant, PKM2 is fully active, enabling the maximal use of glucose through glycolysis. When serine levels are low, PKM2 activity is attenuated. This enables the fast shuttling of glucose-derived carbon to serine biosynthesis, compensating for the serine shortfall and enabling growth and proliferation in the absence of these amino acids. Finally, by activating PKM2, serine supports aerobic glycolysis and lactate production, events that are critical for cancer cell growth and survival [<xref rid="CIT0033">33</xref>].</p><p>Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are important regulators of apoptosis and pro-survival signaling pathways whose deregulation in various cancers is associated with tumor growth.

NS5 AdoMet-dependent mRNA methyltransferase (MTase) is a viral protein involved in flavivirus replication. Specifically, no antiviral drugs are available to treat the life-threatening flavivirus infections caused by Dengue or Zika viruses.

A number of hit compounds were removed to avoid chemically infeasible molecules, such as spiro-compounds or compounds with more than 19 bonds or with more than 5 rings. In addition, all compounds were required to contain a terminal cationic or basic moiety for favorable interactions with the S2 pocket, resulting in 18,803 hits.

Methods based on Scaffold Tree and Scaffold Network analyzes can lead to synthetically accessible natural product-like compounds. The design principles applying to other fragment screening libraries can be applied equally to natural product-based fragment libraries.
