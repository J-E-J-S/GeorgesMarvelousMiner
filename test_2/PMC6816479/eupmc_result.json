    "Introduction: Fragment-based drug discovery can identify relatively simple compounds with low binding affinity due to fewer binding interactions with protein targets. FBDD reduces the library size and provides simpler starting points for subsequent chemical optimization of initial hits. A much greater proportion of chemical space can be sampled in fragment-based screening compared to larger molecules with typical molecular weights (MWs) of 250-500 g mol-1 used in high-throughput screening (HTS) libraries. Areas covered: The authors cover the role of natural products in fragment-based drug discovery against parasitic disease targets. They review the approaches to develop fragment-based libraries either using natural products or natural product-like compounds. The authors present approaches to fragment-based drug discovery against parasitic diseases and compare these libraries with the 3D attributes of natural products. Expert opinion: To effectively use the three-dimensional properties and the chemical diversity of natural products in fragment-based drug discovery against parasitic diseases, there needs to be a mind-shift. Library design, in the medicinal chemistry area, has acknowledged that escaping flat-land is very important to increase the chances of clinical success. Attempts to increase sp3 richness in fragment libraries are acknowledged. Sufficient low molecular weight natural products are known to create true natural product fragment libraries."
