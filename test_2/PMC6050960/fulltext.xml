Cellular metabolic pathways have emerged as important regulators of many viral infections, including infections by gammaherpesviruses that require several lipid synthetic pathways for optimal replication. Liver X receptors (LXRs) are transcription factors that are critical regulators of cellular fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis pathways. Not surprisingly, LXRs are attractive therapeutic targets in cardiovascular disease. Here we describe an antiviral role for LXRs in the context of gammaherpesvirus infection of primary macrophages. We show that type I interferon increased LXR expression following infection. Surprisingly, there was not a corresponding induction of LXR target genes. Rather, LXRs suppressed the expression of target genes, leading to decreased fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, two metabolic pathways that support gammaherpesvirus replication. This report defines LXR-mediated restriction of cholesterol and lipid synthesis as an intrinsic metabolic mechanism to restrict viral replication in innate immune cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>IMPORTANCE</title><p>Fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis pathways of the host play important roles in diverse biological systems.

LXR&#x003b1; and LXR&#x003b2; are two related LXR isoforms with tissue-specific expression and ubiquitous expression, respectively. Consistent with the role of LXRs as metabolic regulators, most LXR target genes encode proteins that mediate fatty acid synthesis or cholesterol efflux from cells. Not surprisingly, LXRs have received much attention as therapeutic targets, especially in cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Metabolic pathways of the host orchestrate replication of diverse viruses. The ability of LXRs to regulate expression of proteins and enzymes involved in lipid metabolism is, therefore, likely to modify viral replication. Intriguingly, in the few published virus-host interaction studies, LXRs have been reported to play opposing roles in viral replication. Activation of LXRs stimulates expression of fatty acid synthesis enzymes and subsequent increases in levels of intracellular fatty acids, a process that is likely to facilitate viral replication. Indeed, increased fatty acid synthesis induced by treatment with synthetic LXR agonists facilitates replication of coxsackie B virus (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>However, active LXRs also upregulate transporters, such as ABCA1, that mediate efflux of free or unesterified cholesterol (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). This efflux eventually leads to depletion of intracellular cholesterol, which subsequently activates endogenous cholesterol synthesis to restore cholesterol homeostasis. Because distinct viruses have various rates of replication and differential requirements for cholesterol itself versus other intermediates of the cholesterol synthesis pathway, it is not surprising that LXR-dependent changes in the cholesterol homeostasis can have antiviral or proviral effects depending on the particular virus infection. Synthetic LXR agonists restrict replication of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), hepatitis C virus (HCV) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), presumably by altering cholesterol homeostasis, although the activity of cholesterol synthesis pathway was not examined in those studies. The mechanisms by which LXRs regulate viral replication remain poorly defined. To date, the majority of studies exploring LXR-virus interactions relied on artificial agonists that activate both LXR isoforms in addition to off-target effects. Further, there is little to no understanding of how LXRs regulate replication of DNA viruses.</p><p>The current report focuses on gammaherpesviruses, ubiquitous pathogens that are associated with a wide range of malignancies (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The Lagunoff group has elegantly demonstrated that the replication and latency of Kaposi&#x02019;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) are supported by the fatty acid synthesis pathway (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). We have shown that the related murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) usurps intermediates of the cholesterol synthesis pathway to facilitate viral replication (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The results of those studies suggest that, similarly to other viruses, gammaherpesviruses benefit from active cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis pathways that are also classically stimulated by LXRs. Further, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), an endogenous LXR agonist (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), accumulates in MHV68-infected primary macrophages (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and should stimulate expression of LXR target genes, with subsequent activation of metabolic pathways that support viral replication.</p><p>Surprisingly, we found that MHV68 replication was increased in primary macrophages deficient in both LXR isoforms. Consistent with this antiviral role of LXRs, expression of both the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; isoforms was increased in infected macrophages in a type I interferon (IFN)-dependent manner. In contrast to the well-defined role of LXRs in activating expression of cholesterol efflux and fatty acid synthesis genes, LXR target genes were expressed to a lower level in wild-type macrophages than in LXR-deficient infected macrophages, along with suppressed activity of the cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. Thus, LXR-mediated repression of metabolic pathways that are beneficial for viral replication contributed to the intrinsic antiviral state of primary innate immune cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s1.1"><title>LXRs attenuate MHV68 replication in primary macrophages.</title><p>To define the role of LXRs during MHV68 infection, viral replication was assessed in primary macrophages derived from C57BL/6J (BL6) mice or mice genetically deficient in both LXR&#x003b1; and LXR&#x003b2; isoforms (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) (referred to here as LXR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice).

To determine the extent to which the host response to inactivated MHV68 was sufficient to increase LXR expression, LXR mRNA levels were compared in primary macrophages infected with either live or UV-inactivated MHV68.

Our results support the following working model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig.&#x000a0;8</xref>). Consistent with the antiviral nature of LXRs in macrophages, type I IFN produced by these cells following viral infection further increases baseline expression of both LXR isoforms. However, in contrast to their classical role as transcriptional activators, LXRs repress select target genes, decreasing expression of enzymes mediating fatty acid synthesis and cholesterol efflux proteins. As a result of this transcriptional repression of LXR target genes, there is attenuated activity of both the fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis pathways, two biosynthetic pathways that support MHV68 replication.</p><fig id="fig8" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;8&#x000a0;</label><caption><p>Working model. Macrophages respond to type I IFN produced during viral infection by increasing expression of LXRs. The LXRs interact with nuclear corepressors to limit the expression of select LXR target genes. This repression of gene expression limits the activity of the proviral cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis pathways and restricts MHV68 replication.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mbo0041839830008"/></fig><sec id="s2.1"><title>Regulation of LXR target genes in infected cells.</title><p>This study demonstrated that gene repression, rather than activation, may be the biologically relevant antiviral role of LXRs in primary innate immune cells. This is consistent with a previous report by Wagner et al. (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), which additionally emphasized the cell type specificity of this phenomenon, as LXR-mediated gene repression was not detected in liver, muscle, or fibroblasts. We have found that LXRs did not mediate antiviral effects in MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>). In contrast, our observation that LXR-mediated gene repression is antiviral in primary macrophages highlights a previously unappreciated mechanism by which innate immune cells maintain a primed, intrinsic antiviral state even prior to the encounter with the pathogen.</p><p>In their unliganded state, nuclear receptors, including LXRs, recruit nuclear corepressors (NCoRs), primarily NCoR1 and NCoR2 (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The NCoRs then facilitate transcriptional repression through the recruitment of histone deacetylases to the target gene promoters. It is possible that the LXR complex delivers the nuclear corepressors to the corresponding promoters, as expression of LXR-dependent genes increases in macrophages genetically deficient in both isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>). It is not clear what drives expression of these genes in the absence of LXRs, including during infection, when a viral factor may enact a "tug of war" with LXRs to increase expression of target genes. The ABCA1 promoter contains functional binding sites for upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF1) and USF2 (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), with the possibility that USF1/USF2 may contribute to ABCA1 expression in LXR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages. Interestingly, varicella-zoster virus and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which are alpha- and gammaherpesviruses, respectively, usurp USF1 and USF2 to facilitate expression of viral lytic transactivators (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Furthermore, USF1 binds to the latency-associated transcript promoter of herpes simplex virus (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and activates the EBV DNA polymerase gene promoter (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Finally, the E6 protein of human papillomavirus activates telomerase expression by inhibiting the USF-mediated repression of tert (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Future studies will determine the relative contributions of USF and other host and viral transcription factors to the expression of LXR target genes during gammaherpesvirus infection.</p><p>Additional host factors may enforce repression of LXR target genes. IRF-3 was shown to attenuate LXR activity, as demonstrated by an IRF-3-dependent reduction in LXR target gene expression following treatment with Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and TLR4 ligands (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). MHV68 infection activates IRF-3, which supports type I IFN expression by infected macrophages (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, we observed similar levels of expression of LXR target genes in BL6 and IRF-3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages (data not shown), suggesting that IRF-3 activation in the context of gammaherpesvirus infection does not further attenuate expression of LXR-driven genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2.2"><title>Regulation of virus replication by LXRs.</title><p>This report defines an underappreciated function of LXRs within primary immune cells that supports the intrinsic antiviral state of these cells. Specifically, LXRs limited the expression of genes that facilitate fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, pathways which promote replication of diverse viruses. While the mechanism by which inhibition of fatty acid synthesis restricts gammaherpesvirus replication is unknown, the Lagunoff group demonstrated that KSHV requires this pathway very late in its replication cycle, likely to facilitate viral egress (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Attenuation of cholesterol biosynthesis restricts MHV68 replication; however, this restriction is not due to suboptimal cholesterol availability. Instead, MHV68 replication is supported by isoprenoids, intermediates of the cholesterol synthesis pathway that are required for protein prenylation (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Those previous reports, as well as data presented in this study, support the hypothesis that the LXR-mediated repression of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in primary macrophages is responsible for the antiviral activity of LXRs during MHV68 infection.</p><p>While this antiviral mechanism likely applies to other gammaherpesviruses, and possibly to other DNA viruses, there remain many questions regarding the role of LXR in RNA virus replication. Until this report, most of the studies examining the role of LXRs during viral infection were performed in the context of LXR stimulation performed with artificial LXR agonists. In the context of HCV, HIV, and NDV infections, LXR activation attenuated viral replication in an ABCA1-dependent manner, suggesting that these viruses rely on cellular cholesterol for optimal replication (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Another report suggested that the LXR-mediated attenuation of HCV replication is due to the increase in LXR-dependent expression of the inducible degrader of the LDL receptor, thus limiting uptake of extracellular cholesterol (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, treatment of MHV68-infected macrophages with a synthetic LXR agonist did not confer the expected proviral effect, in spite of induction of fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>). It is possible that the off-target effects of this synthetic LXR agonist counteracted the proviral effects on fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. Such off-target effects could have contributed to altered replication of RNA viruses in synthetic agonist-treated cells. Alternatively, synthetic agonists may induce LXR activation that is not entirely physiological. We have observed that some genes, such as the ACC gene, that were expressed at similar levels in LXR-sufficient and LXR-deficient macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4F</xref>) were robustly induced by the synthetic agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.&#x000a0;6C</xref>). This suggests that activation of LXR with synthetic agonists may not faithfully represent physiological regulation of LXR-dependent genes.</p><p>In this study, we also tested the contribution of CH25H expression to the antiviral activity of LXRs. 25HC, a product of CH25H, exerts broad antiviral functions (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and is an agonist of LXRs (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). We have shown that CH25H expression specifically represses late stages of MHV68 DNA synthesis without affecting expression of type I IFN and interferon-stimulated genes in infected primary macrophages (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Interestingly, similarly to what was previously observed for mouse cytomegalovirus, the antiviral activity of 25HC was independent of LXR expression in MHV68-infected macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). Thus, the fascinating mechanisms underlying antiviral activity of 25HC are clearly LXR independent.</p><p>In summary, there is a growing appreciation of the interplay between viral infection and host cell metabolism, including fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis pathways (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). This interplay is likely to be modified by specific viruses and the cell types targeted for infection. An important issue to be resolved is that of elucidating the exact molecular mechanism by which lipogenic pathways facilitate viral replication. While synthesis of lipids and cholesterol may facilitate structural features of virions and support the cellular membrane remodeling observed in some infections, it is likely that there are several metabolites of lipogenic pathways that alter the signaling milieu of the infected cell to facilitate viral replication. We found that the isoprenoid intermediates produced by the cholesterol synthesis pathway, and not cholesterol <italic>per se</italic>, are what support gammaherpesvirus replication in macrophages (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Thus, prenylation of cellular and/or viral proteins using isoprenoid intermediates is likely at the heart of the proviral activity of cholesterol synthesis pathway during gammaherpesvirus replication. Finally, because novel LXR agonists are being developed to treat cardiovascular diseases, it is important to consider potential effects of such future therapies on the ubiquitous herpesvirus infections in humans.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Additional details are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table&#x000a0;S1</xref>&#x000a0;in the supplemental material.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="tabS1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1128/mBio.01115-18.2</object-id><label>TABLE&#x000a0;S1&#x000a0;</label><p>Additional details of the genes discussed.

The isopropanol was collected and pooled with the initial 1.5&#x000a0;ml, for a total of 3&#x000a0;ml. The cellular proteins were solubilized in 500&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l of 0.1&#x000a0;N NaOH on a plate rocker for 30&#x000a0;min at room temperature. The protein concentrations were quantified using the Lowry method. The extracted lipids were dried under a gentle flow of N<sub>2</sub> at 50&#x000b0;C and then dissolved in dichloromethane containing a lipid mixture of known standards to aid in visualization of lipid bands. The mixture consisted of cholesterol (30&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l, 1&#x000a0;mg/ml), palmitate (20&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l, 10&#x000a0;mg/ml), triglyceride (15&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l, 10&#x000a0;mg/ml), and cholesteryl ester (5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l, 10&#x000a0;mg/ml) standards. The entire volume of the lipid solution was spotted onto high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HP-TLC) silica gel plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and allowed to dry. Lipids were separated by a solvent system containing hexane-isopropyl ether-acetic acid (65:35:2 [vol/vol/vol]). Lipids were then visualized by exposure to iodine, the desired bands were scraped from the plate, and <sup>3</sup>H incorporation into each lipid band was quantified by liquid scintillation counting (Packard Tri-Carb 2100&#x000a0;TR liquid scintillation counter; PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). The incorporation of the radiolabel was then normalized to the cellular protein concentration for each sample.</p></sec><sec id="s3.6"><title>Western blot analysis.</title><p>The antibodies used were anti-&#x003b2;-actin (Novus Biological, Littleton, CO) (1:20,000), anti-LXR&#x003b1; (Abcam, Inc., Cambridge, MA) (1:1,000), and a secondary goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc., West Grove, PA) (1:25,000).</p></sec><sec id="s3.7"><title>Microarray and analyses.</title><p>Three independent batches of BL6 (wild-type) and LXR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow-derived macrophages were infected in triplicate at an MOI of 10 for 24&#x000a0;h. Total RNA was isolated as described above and submitted to the Genomics Core Facility at Brown University for microarray analysis. Total RNA (100&#x000a0;ng) was analyzed for its integrity using an Agilent BioAnalyzer RNA6000 Nano chip. The purity of the samples was assessed using an ND100 NanoDrop spectrophotometer. All samples had RNA integrity numbers (RINs) of &#x0003e;8.8 and 260/280 ratios of &#x0003e;1.8.
