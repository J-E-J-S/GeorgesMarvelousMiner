Numerous substances have been addressed using synthetic biology approaches. However, many proposed biosensors are based on living, genetically modified organisms and are therefore limited in shelf life, usability and biosafety. We addressed these issues by the construction of an extensible, cell-free biosensor. Storage is possible through freeze drying on paper. Following the addition of an aqueous sample, a highly efficient cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) reaction is initiated. Specific allosteric transcription factors modulate the expression of &#x02018;superfolder&#x02019; green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) depending on the presence of the substance of interest. The resulting fluorescence intensities are analyzed with a conventional smartphone accompanied by simple and cheap light filters. An ordinary differential equitation (ODE) model of the biosensors was developed, which enabled prediction and optimization of performance. With an optimized cell-free biosensor based on the <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> MerR transcriptional activator, detection of 6 &#x003bc;g/L Hg(II) ions in water was achieved. Furthermore, a completely new biosensor for the detection of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), a substance used as date-rape drug, was established by employing the naturally occurring transcriptional repressor BlcR from <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="22"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Water quality assessment is an issue of global relevance. In regions that suffer from natural disasters or industrial accidents, for example, a quick and reliable test of water quality is indispensable to inhibit the spreading of diseases and to prevent human intoxications. Among the most widespread detrimental substances in water are heavy metals, in particular arsenic and mercury [<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Mercury affects liver, kidney, and the central nervous system and may lead to severe diseases of these organs [<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Mercury contamination of water causes steep health and human costs, as illustrated by the Minamata incidence, which lead to thousands of cases of methylmercury poisoning [<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Hence, the detection of detrimental substances is a serious challenge of public health and environmental protection.</p><p>Specificity, sensitivity and speed are key features of suitable sensors. Biological sensing elements have the potential to meet these criteria and can even be superior to conventional chemical sensors. In addition, biosensors are applicable for a wide range of analytical purposes [<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and can potentially be produced at low costs [<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, biosensors are emerging as promising tools for water quality assessment.</p><p>Among others, a biosensor for mercury detection has been developed [<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is based on the MerR transcriptional activator protein, which is a member of the MerR family found in gram-negative bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the presence of Hg(II) salts, MerR activates protein expression <italic>via</italic> the <italic>mer</italic> operator [<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Besides natural and accidental water contamination, criminals deliberately add noxious substances to beverages to incapacitate their victims. Such date rape drugs cause symptoms such as a loss of consciousness and will [<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Hereof, &#x003b3;-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and its precursor &#x003b3;-butyrolactone (GBL) have been reported to be used in the majority of cases [<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Trace amounts of GHB occur in the human body at concentrations of about 1 &#x003bc;g/mL as a component of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) pathway [<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These amounts are negligible compared to the dose of GHB leading to incapacitation, which is approximately 2 g for an average adult [<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The main challenge in uncovering GHB intoxication in cases of assault is the fast metabolic degradation of GHB, which occurs in the range of several hours [<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Testing for GHB intoxication with high sensitivity (10 &#x003bc;g/mL in blood, 15 &#x003bc;g/mL in urine) is restricted to clinics that possess specialized equipment, for example HPLC or chemical analyzers [<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A sensor that enables fast, reliable and robust point-of-care diagnosis with minimum amount of equipment and sample preparation remains to be developed.</p><p>We identified a transcriptional repressor from <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>, BlcR, as a potential sensing element for GHB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210940.g001">Fig 1</xref>). BlcR naturally acts as a repressor of transcription by binding in tetrameric form to a DNA region upstream of the <italic>blcABC</italic> operon [<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Upon binding of GBL or GHB, the BlcR tetramer releases its DNA recognition sequence and allows expression of the corresponding gene cluster [<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

However, the application of living, genetically modified organisms outside the laboratory can be complicated by legal regulations and safety concerns.

This competition of reporter and repressor mRNA for translation resources was modeled as a competitive inhibition [<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210940.g003">Fig 3</xref> gives an overview of all species and reactions that were incorporated into the model.

In particular, it can be used to illustrate the influence of the repressor protein, which is a crucial component of a CFPS biosensor as its concentration is decisive for the sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio of the biosensor. There are two fundamentally different scenarios with regard to the repressor: It can be either encoded on a plasmid and be co-expressed with the reporter or it can already be present in the reaction mixture as a pre-expressed protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210940.s009">S4B Fig</xref>). Co-expressing reporter and repressor is a convenient method for producing a biosensor. The model shows that the ratio of the plasmid concentrations is very important in this case (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210940.s009">S4A Fig</xref>). If the reporter-to-repressor ratio is too high, a strong background signal occurs and the relative increase in the presence of an analyte is small and would be difficult to discern. In contrast, a low ratio would inhibit an induction due to strong repression and a scarcity of resources, which are consumed by the expression of the repressor. Given the parameters of this model a plasmid ratio of 1:1 yields a good compromise between low background and strong signal upon induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210940.s009">S4A Fig</xref>).</p><p>However, the model demonstrates that pre-expression of the repressor in cells yields better results in terms of signal intensity and background noise, as the competition for resources does not limit the strength of the output signal and a repression may occur right from the beginning when no analyte is present. Consequently, cell extracts that already contained the necessary repressor or activator protein were used for all biosensor experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210940.s009">S4B Fig</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Paper-based CFPS with homemade extract</title><p>It has been shown that CFPS reactions work under a wide range of conditions.

Cell-free protein synthesis of the reporter protein sfGFP worked well on paper when homemade extract was employed.

The ion Hg(II) and the small molecule GHB, both hazardous for humans, served as analytes and were detected by employing MerR and BlcR, respectively, as transcriptional regulators in the cell-free reaction. Mathematical modeling of biosensor behavior demonstrated that pre-expressing a repressor protein is more favorable than expressing it in tandem with the reporter protein. The proposed model builds a strong basis for further optimization of biosensor systems based on CFPS and aids the understanding of the underlying mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Two mechanisms may lead to successful detection of the analytes via fluorescence levels: Repressor and activator proteins may act as amplifiers of reporter production upon induction with their respective target analyte. Furthermore, detrimental effects of the analytes on CFPS may be decreased when MerR or BlcR are present from the beginning, as they bind the analytes, the consequence being that these cannot act on the transcription or translation machinery. The relationship of these mechanisms as well as the impact of the analyte should be addressed in further studies</p><p>The GHB-binding repressor protein BlcR was employed as a novel biosensor element. Our data suggest that a BlcR-based GHB / GBL sensor is not suited to be used as a whole cell <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> biosensor, but amenable for <italic>in vitro</italic> applications. Identification of GHB in drinking water is feasible with the presented system. Nevertheless, optimization is needed to increase sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio.</p><p>Key challenges for the construction of applicable paper-based CFPS biosensors are response time, robustness, specificity and storability. The response time of the proposed biosensor is relatively fast with approximately one hour. For quantification, control reactions are important to account for the effects analytes have on CFPS. In this regard, manipulation of either the concentration of transcription factor or its corresponding operator site may lead to fine-tuning of sfGFP expression levels, thereby enabling precise quantification of the analyte. Optimization of extract preparation and activity of both MerR and BlcR extracts may readily lead to a higher signal-to-noise ratio. Nevertheless, varying quality of cell extract batches, as often described in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], must not be overlooked. Furthermore, possible cross-reactions in water samples with multiple analytes have to be critically investigated in future experiments. However, mercury biosensors based on the same biological elements have been found to be highly specific in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210940.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Moreover, as biosensors with different specificities can easily be used in parallel in our proposed system, cross-reactivities of individual sensing elements could potentially be compensated for.</p><p>Cell-free production of sfGFP is possible at 25 &#x000b0;C and potentially even at lower temperatures. Thus, an application in the field is quite conceivable. The most favorable storage conditions for the freeze-dried biosensor remain to be investigated. In particular for field usage, storability and handling have to be considered. Pardee and colleagues reported a shelf life of lyophilized extract of one year at room temperature, at least under conditions of light protection, inert gas atmosphere and presence of silica gel desiccation packages [<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>With the herein developed smartphone-based setup for the detection of fluorescence, a cheap and easy method is proposed that enables the use of fluorescent reporter proteins in assay applications in the open field. This is a valuable alternative to colorimetric outputs, for example via beta-galactosidase [<xref rid="pone.0210940.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To ensure a more accurate quantification of the analytes, a reference curve could be produced with each measurement.

After lyophilization of the freshly prepared cell-free reactions on paper discs, the latter were stored for six days at room temperature in closed 1.5 mL reaction tubes. Some of the tubes were sealed with adhesive film (black squares) directly after lyophilization to avoid possible detrimental effects on the lyophilized reaction caused by humidity. Afterwards, 15 &#x003bc;L water were added to the discs to initiate the CFPS reaction.
