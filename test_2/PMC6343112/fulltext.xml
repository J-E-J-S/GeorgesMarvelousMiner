sequences and the definition
of essential gene sets were fundamental in the start of the genome
engineering era. In a recent study, redundant and unnecessary genes
were systematically deleted from the Gram-positive bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, an industrial production host of high-value
secreted proteins. This culminated in strain PG10, which lacks about
36% of the genome, thus representing the most minimal <italic>Bacillus</italic> chassis currently available. Here, we show that this &#x0201c;mini<italic>Bacillus</italic>&#x0201d; strain has synthetic traits that are favorable
for producing &#x0201c;difficult-to-produce proteins&#x0201d;. As exemplified
with different staphylococcal antigens, PG10 overcomes several bottlenecks
in protein production related to the secretion process and instability
of the secreted product. These findings show for the first time that
massive genome reduction can substantially improve secretory protein
production by a bacterial expression host, and underpin the high potential
of genome-engineered strains as future cell factories.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic></kwd><kwd>PG10</kwd><kwd>genome

the ninth International
Conference on Bacilli, the complete genome sequence of the widely
appreciated bacterial cell factory <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> 168 was announced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> This represented
one of the early milestones in bacterial genomics, and it was the
starting point for many subsequent systems and synthetic biological
studies. These included a first systematic analysis of essential gene
functions and the genome-wide elucidation of gene regulatory and metabolic
networks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Importantly, the genome sequence of a bacterium
that is naturally competent for DNA uptake opened up unprecedented
possibilities for synthetic biology. Accordingly, several subsequent
studies explored to what extent the genome of <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic> can be engineered, for instance, by the removal of prophages, AT-rich
islands, and otherwise dispensable genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup></p><p>From a biotechnological perspective, engineering the <italic>Bacillus</italic> genome is very attractive, as it allows the elimination of unwanted
features like the production of surfactants and the redirection of
cellular metabolism toward the production of proteins and vitamins,
which are major <italic>Bacillus</italic> products.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Nonetheless, most <italic>Bacillus</italic> genome engineering
studies to date were more focused on understanding the complexity
of a living cell from a fundamental point of view than on industrial
applications of genome-reduced bacteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> In fact, the possibility of redesigning <italic>Bacillus</italic> as a cell factory was so far only explored for the production of
industrial enzymes and nucleosides such as guanosine and thymidine
from bacilli.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> As shown by Ogasawara and
colleagues, reducing the <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic> genome
by 20.7% (strain MGB874) allowed improved production of the secreted
alkaline cellulase Egl237 by about 2-fold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> Yet, another <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic> strain (MG1M) with
a 23.3% reduced genome secreted an alkaline cellulase and a subtilisin-like
alkaline protease to comparable levels as the parental 168 strain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> While these findings were encouraging, they
did not yet represent radical improvements in terms of the overall
productivity of <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic>.</p><p>In a recent
study, Reu&#x003b2; <italic>et al.</italic> presented
the smallest engineered <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic> genomes
known to date.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> Starting from the previously
constructed <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic> &#x00394;6 strain, which
lacks 332 prophage- and AT-rich island-encoded genes (<italic>i.e.</italic>, 7.7% of the wild-type genome), the total number of genes was reduced
to 2700 in strain PG10 and 2648 in strain PS38. This represented a
genome reduction of &#x0223c;36% compared to the wild-type genome,
which includes 4253 genes. Importantly, compared to other genome-engineered <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic> strains, the PG10 and PS38 strains lacked
the genes for eight major secreted <italic>Bacillus</italic> proteases,
which were previously identified as major bottlenecks for heterologous
protein production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> In addition, Reu&#x003b2; <italic>et al.</italic> overcame the loss
of genetic competence that was previously observed upon genome reduction
by introducing a cassette for enhanced expression of the competence
transcription factor ComK. While the &#x0201c;mini<italic>Bacillus</italic>&#x0201d; strains PG10 and PS38 were characterized in much detail
with respect to overall physiological features, their application
potential had not been addressed. Thus, we asked the question whether
these genome-reduced strains might be advantageous for the production
of &#x0201c;difficult proteins&#x0201d; that are highly susceptible
to proteases and poorly secreted by the <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic> strains generally used in the laboratory or industry, including
the prototype strain 168. In this respect, it is noteworthy that secretory
protein production systems are preferable over cellular production
systems, as the downstream processing of secreted proteins is generally
easier and more cost-effective. Here we show that the genome-reduced <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic> PG10 strain allows the production of secreted
heterologous proteins that cannot be obtained with the 168 strain.
Briefly, the beneficial changes in the PG10 strain relate both to
reduced proteolysis and enhanced translation. This represents an important
step forward in the secretory production of difficult proteins.</p><sec id="sec2"><title>Results
and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Susceptibility of Model Staphylococcal Proteins
to Particular
Secreted Proteases</title><p>To test the application potential of mini<italic>Bacillus</italic> strains for production of difficult proteins, we
selected four heterologous secreted reporter proteins that we (i)
could not produce in <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic> 168 or the
previously developed protease mutant <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic> WB800, (ii) could produce and purify from another expression host,

detect either with a specific antibody or a tag.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> These are four
secreted proteins of <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic>, namely, the
chemotaxis inhibitory protein (CHIPS), the staphylococcal complement
inhibitor (SCIN), the immunodominant staphylococcal antigen A (IsaA),
and the <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> nuclease (Nuc). In the present
study, these proteins served primarily as read out for improved secretion,
but they also have potential applications in antistaphylococcal immunotherapies
or as diagnostic markers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> In addition, we focused our study
on the PG10 strain because it still contains the <italic>amyE</italic> gene that can serve as a facile chromosomal expression platform.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup></p><p>As a first approach to determine the overall
feasibility of producing CHIPS, SCIN, IsaA and Nuc in <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic>, we produced these proteins in <italic>L.&#x000a0;lactis</italic> as
previously described, and then tested their stability in spent culture
media of different <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic> mutant strains.
In addition to <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic> 168, these strains
included mutants lacking combinations of the <italic>nprB</italic>, <italic>aprE</italic>, <italic>epr</italic>, <italic>bpr</italic>, <italic>nprE</italic>, <italic>mpr, vpr</italic>, <italic>wprA</italic>, <italic>htrA</italic>, and <italic>htrB</italic> protease genes
as well as the genome-engineered &#x00394;6 and PG10 strains. As shown
in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>, within
2 h of incubation, the four <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> reporter
proteins were degraded in spent media of <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic>, with the exception of media from strains that lack the <italic>wprA</italic> gene for the &#x0201c;wall protease A&#x0201d; (including
the mini<italic>Bacillus</italic> PG10). Of note, all four reporter
proteins remained stable for up to 24 h in spent growth media, as
long as the respective cultured cells were WprA-deficient (not shown).
WprA was thus far considered to be active at the membrane-cell wall
interface of <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic>, and the present findings
show for the first time that the secreted fraction of this enzyme
has strong proteolytic activity as well (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>). Taken together, these observations show
that degradation by extracellular proteases can be a major limiting
factor in the production of CHIPS, SCIN, IsaA, and Nuc in <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis.</italic></p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Stability of staphylococcal proteins to particular

reporter proteins CHIPS,
SCIN, IsaA, and Nuc in <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic> we used the
&#x0201c;subtilin-regulated expression system&#x0201d; (SURE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> This inducible high-level expression system
is based on sensing of the bacteriocin subtilin by the SpaRK two-component
regulatory system which subsequently drives the transcription of the
P<italic>spaS</italic> promoter. Therefore, the <italic>spaRK</italic> genes were inserted into the <italic>amyE</italic> gene of both
the 168 and PG10 strains. To direct secretion of the staphylococcal
reporters into the growth medium, we initially selected the N-terminal
signal peptide of the &#x003b1;-amylase AmyQ (SP<sub>AmyQ</sub>) of <italic>Bacillus licheniformis</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> While
this signal peptide directed some secretion of SCIN in the 168 strain,
it did not facilitate any secretion of CHIPS, IsaA, or Nuc. Yet, the
CHIPS and IsaA proteins fused to this signal peptide were detectable
in the cell fraction and the same applied to SCIN (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>A and data not shown). In fact,
168 cells producing the SP<sub>AmyQ</sub>-SCIN fusion accumulated
this precursor in substantial amounts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>A). Since ineffective protein secretion may
relate to the choice of signal peptide, the CHIPS, IsaA, and Nuc proteins
were also fused to the signal peptide of the xylanase XynA (SP<sub>XynA</sub>) of <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> which did allow some secretion of CHIPS and IsaA in the
168 strain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>A). However, in this case also the CHIPS and IsaA proteins accumulated
in the cells, mostly in a precursor form (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>A). Of note, no secretion of Nuc was detectable
when fused to SP<sub>XynA</sub> (not shown). To pinpoint potential
bottlenecks in the secretion of SCIN and IsaA by the 168 strain, the
respective cells were fractionated, and the localization of these
two staphylococcal proteins was assessed by Western blotting, using
the native cytoplasmic protein TrxA and the membrane-associated lipoprotein
EfeM as controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>B). This showed that SCIN and IsaA accumulated in the membrane
fraction, while these proteins were not detectable in the cytoplasmic
fraction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>B)
or in the cell wall (not shown). The accumulation of SCIN and IsaA
in the membrane fraction is indicative of aberrant translocation by
the Sec secretion machinery and ineffective processing of the signal
peptide by signal peptidase. Further, the absence of these proteins
from the cell wall and growth medium suggests that SCIN and IsaA either
do not reach these destinations due to defective membrane translocation
or that they are subject to degradation by proteases like WprA as
soon as they appear at the membrane-cell wall interface.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Induced overproduction

was induced with subtilin and culture samples were collected 2 h post
induction. (a) The cellular (cells) and extracellular (medium) levels
of the expressed staphylococcal proteins were assessed by Western

the secretion of CHIPS, SCIN, IsaA and Nuc
in the genome-reduced strain PG10. To this end, secretion of SCIN
was directed by SP<sub>AmyQ</sub>, whereas secretion of CHIPS, IsaA
and Nuc was driven by SP<sub>XynA</sub>. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>C, effective secretion of all
four staphylococcal proteins by the PG10 strain could be demonstrated,
albeit that the cells did accumulate some precursor forms of CHIPS,
SCIN and IsaA. Of note, all the Nuc produced by strain PG10 was secreted.
On this basis, we conclude that the PG10 strain displays improved
secretion and substantially reduced extracytoplasmic degradation of
CHIPS, SCIN, IsaA and Nuc. The lowered degradation of the four staphylococcal
proteins is in line with the absence of eight secreted <italic>Bacillus</italic> proteases from the PG10 strain, and the absence of CHIPS, SCIN,
IsaA and Nuc degradation in spent medium of this strain as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>. Having demonstrated
production and secretion of staphylococcal proteins by PG10, we next
examined the amount of IsaA protein secreted into the growth medium
because, of all four staphylococcal proteins, IsaA was produced at
the highest level. As shown by LDS-PAGE and a standard curve with
bovine serum albumin, IsaA was secreted to a concentration of about
7 mg/L after 2 h of induction (data not shown). While this is a relatively
low yield compared to the gram/liter yields of industrial enzymes
obtained in industrial fermentations, it is still a considerable yield
compared to the close-to-zero yield observed for the 168 strain. Nonetheless,
this raised the question whether genome engineering had somehow affected
the full potential of the PG10 strain for protein secretion compared
to the parental 168 strain. This possibility was tested by expressing
the &#x003b1;-amylase AmyQ in the PG10 strain. The level of AmyQ secretion
by PG10 was about 2-fold lower compared to the 168 strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>). This may relate
in part to the degradation by an as yet unidentified protease as evidenced
by the presence of AmyQ degradation products in the growth medium
of strain PG10.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Overproduction of AmyQ in the mini<italic>Bacillus</italic> strain

performance of strain PG10
relates to changes in the balance between induced protein secretion
and degradation, we performed a time course experiment where the production
and secretion of IsaA in the PG10 and 168 strains was assayed as a
function of the time of induction with subtilin. Indeed, the amount
of IsaA detectable in the medium at 15 min post induction was higher
in PG10 than in 168, which implies that IsaA translation was more
effective in the PG10 strain. In addition, the time course experiment
highlighted distinctive features of the 168 and PG10 strains in terms
of IsaA secretion. In particular, induction of IsaA production in
the 168 strain led to rapid accumulation of full-size IsaA in the
cells until 5 h post induction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>, upper panel), while at later time points (from 24
h onward) IsaA production was strongly reduced. The secreted full-size
IsaA (marked *) was mostly detectable but at very low amounts in the
growth medium of the 168 strain at 15 min post induction after which
it started to disappear; concomitantly, IsaA forms with aberrant mobility
started to appear in the medium. Between 30 min and 4 h post induction
of IsaA production, strain 168 mounted a high secretion stress response
as was evidenced by relatively high levels of the secretion stress-responsive
HtrA and HtrB proteins in the medium (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00342/suppl_file/sb8b00342_si_001.pdf">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). Since it was previously shown that the secretion
stress response in <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic> is elicited by
malfolded secretory proteins at the membrane-cell wall interface,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> our present findings for strain 168 are indicative of saturation
of the secretion pathway with IsaA molecules at this subcellular location,
ultimately leading to a block in secretion and production of IsaA.
Compared to 168, the levels of IsaA detectable in the PG10 cells remained
low, and the full-size IsaA form (*) as observed in strain 168 was
not detectable at all in cells of the PG10 strain. Yet, this form
was gradually secreted into the growth medium and clearly accumulated
at late time points post induction (from 24 h). Of note, PG10 did
secrete smaller-sized forms of IsaA at earlier time points, especially
until 5 h post induction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>, middle panel). The latter forms may represent incompletely
synthesized IsaA as the full-size mature IsaA was 100% stable when
incubated in spent medium of the PG10 strain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>). Of note, the detected smaller-sized forms
of IsaA are possibly not derived from IsaA degradation by HtrA and
HtrB in the cells and growth medium, because the levels of these proteases
were comparable in samples with high or low IsaA degradation levels
(<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00342/suppl_file/sb8b00342_si_001.pdf">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). Moreover, at
those time points where the 168 strain decreased the production of
IsaA (<italic>i.e.</italic>, 24 and 48 h post induction), the HtrA
and HtrB proteins were barely detectable.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Secretion of IsaA by <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic> 168 or PG10.

growth
medium of the 168 strain will depend on the combined effects of cell
lysis and extracellular proteolysis by secreted proteases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> As evidenced by the TrxA levels, within the
first 5 h post induction, extracellular proteolysis was probably still
low in the 168 strain, whereas some cells started to lyse. At later
stages, extracellular proteolysis led to complete disappearance of
secreted IsaA and, ultimately, also extracellular TrxA became degraded
(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>, lower panel).
In contrast, extracellular proteolysis was largely suppressed in the
PG10 strain as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref> and, hence, in this strain the extracellular appearance of
TrxA was probably largely due to cell lysis.</p><p>To assess a possible
effect on protein production owing to differences
in the copy number of plasmid pRAG3::<italic>isaA</italic> in the
168 and PG10 strains, a whole-genome sequencing analysis was performed.
On the basis of the ratios of the average coverage of plasmid and
chromosomal reads, it was inferred that pRAG3::<italic>isaA</italic> has relative copy numbers of &#x0223c;107 in the PG10 strain and
&#x0223c;80 in the 168 strain (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00342/suppl_file/sb8b00342_si_001.pdf">Supplementary Table S3</ext-link>). This difference is too small to account for the strong
difference in IsaA productivity in the two strains.</p><p>Since even
in the PG10 strain some IsaA degradation was detectable,
as was the case for AmyQ (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>), we investigated whether this residual protease activity
could be inhibited by adding protease inhibitors to the media of growing
bacteria. Indeed, this was the case for IsaA produced by the PG10
strain, where IsaA degradation was substantially reduced for the first
5 h postinduction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>). On the other hand, the protease inhibitors were incapable
of rescuing IsaA produced by the 168 strain. Still, especially at
24 h postinduction IsaA degradation did increase, while the levels
of HtrA and HtrB remained the same (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00342/suppl_file/sb8b00342_si_001.pdf">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>). In fact, the latter is indicative of effective
protease inhibition as it was previously shown that the secreted forms
of HtrA and HtrB are sensitive for degradation by other secreted proteases
of <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> This raises the question, which residual proteases
are still released into the growth medium of the PG10 strain. An intriguing
option is that these are cytoplasmic proteases, because the degradation
of IsaA secreted by strain PG10 after 24 h post induction coincided
with increased levels of cell lysis as visualized by increased extracellular
levels of the cytoplasmic protein TrxA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>, bottom panel). Of note, in a previous study,
we have shown that autolysis can be increased in protease mutant strains
as the extracellular proteases downregulate the levels of autolysins
like LytD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Secretion of IsaA by <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic> 168 or PG10

explains part of the improved
extracellular production of staphylococcal antigens by strain PG10,
it explains neither the drastic differences in the observed precursor
levels of CHIPS and IsaA in the cells, nor the accumulation of SCIN
in the membrane (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b). Instead, this would suggest that there may also be differences
between the 168 and PG10 strains in the secretion efficiency of these
proteins. Such differences could relate to the total amount of secreted
proteins competing for the same pathway or to the overall rates of
translation. In fact, the idea that the translation rates in strains
168 and PG10 differ would be consistent with the previous observation
that cells of the PG10 strain produce about 25% less ribosomal proteins
than the 168 strain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> To test whether
the rates of translation in strains 168 and PG10 differ, we employed
a synthetic module where GFP transcription is coupled to the expression
of the <italic>bmrCD</italic> genes for a drug efflux pump of <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic>. In a previous study, we have shown that
the expression of <italic>bmrCD</italic> is regulated <italic>via</italic> transcriptional attenuation that is modulated by translation of
the BmrB leader peptide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> When BmrB translation
is slowed down by ribosome-targeted antibiotics, such as lincomycin,
the expression of <italic>bmrCD</italic> is triggered. Therefore,
we introduced the transcriptional <italic>bmrC</italic>-GFP fusion
into the <italic>bmrBCD</italic> locus of strains 168 and PG10, and
assessed the levels of GFP expression during growth in the presence
or absence of lincomycin. Under both conditions, the expression of
GFP in the PG10 strain remained much lower than in the 168 strain
where the presence of lincomycin elicited strong induction of GFP
transcriptional activity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Translational efficiency in <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic> 168

of
lincomycin for the 168 and PG10 strains carrying the <italic>bmrC-</italic>GFP fusion. As previously shown for the 168 strain, subinhibitory
concentrations of lincomycin between 0.02 and 0.2 &#x003bc;g/mL still
induced <italic>bmrC</italic>-GFP, but the level of induction decreased
with the reduction of the lincomycin concentration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> In line with this previous observation, in the PG10 strain
a very mild <italic>bmrC</italic>-GFP induction was observed in the
presence of the subinhibitory lincomycin concentration of 0.2 &#x003bc;g/mL,
but not for a lincomycin concentration of 0.02 &#x003bc;g/mL (data not
shown).</p><p>These observations imply that, despite the lower levels
of ribosomal
proteins, the translational efficiency of BmrB is higher in strain
PG10 than in the 168 strain, irrespective of the presence of lincomycin.
Accordingly, it appears that translation is more effective in strain
PG10 than in the 168 strain. It is tempting to speculate that the
apparently enhanced translational activity in the mini<italic>Bacillus</italic> PG10 relates to the substantially decreased number of translatable
mRNAs as a consequence of the significant genome reduction in this
strain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the present
study provides proof-of-principle that
genome engineering can open a window of unprecedented possibilities
for the production of &#x0201c;difficult proteins&#x0201d; in the bacterial
cell factory <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic>. This was exemplified
with the mini<italic>Bacillus</italic> strain PG10 producing four
different staphylococcal antigens that cannot be produced with currently
applied <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic> strains. Of note, the 168
and PG10 strains are far from isogenic due to the deletion of 36%
of the genome in strain PG10. This makes it challenging to pinpoint
the particular mutations and their relative contributions that resulted
in improved protein production by the PG10 strain. Nonetheless, the
present study underlines the benefits of genomic streamlining as an
approach to potentiate and increase the valuable properties of <italic>Bacillus</italic> strains for protein production. Clearly, to reach
the full potential of such mini<italic>Bacillus</italic> strains they
need to be further optimized, especially with respect to potential
product degradation, reduced cell lysis and ease of use in large-scale
fermentation. We are confident that this will deliver new-generation
production strains for a wide spectrum of proteins including not only
enzymes but also many dearly needed biopharmaceuticals.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Materials and

37 &#x000b0;C in a Biotek synergy 2 plate reader, and OD<sub>600</sub> and GFP fluorescence (excitation 485/20 nm, emission 528/20 nm)
readings were taken every 10 min for 24 h. Background fluorescence
was subtracted from control strains not expressing GFP. Finally, arbitrary
transcriptional activity units (TAU) were calculated with the equation:
(GFP<italic><sup>t</sup></italic> &#x02013; GFP<sup><italic>t</italic>&#x02013;1</sup>)/OD<sub>600</sub><italic><sup>t</sup></italic>. In
this equation, <italic>t</italic> represents a specific time point
and <italic>t</italic> &#x02013; 1 the previous time point at which
fluorescence was measured.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.8"><title>Plasmid Copy Number Determination</title><p>Next generation sequencing
