To produce awamori, a traditional spirit (distilled alcoholic beverage) with unique flavors made from steamed rice in Okinawa, Japan, it is necessary to optimize yeast strains for a diversity of tastes and flavors with established qualities. Two categories of flavors are characteristic of awamori; initial scented fruity flavors and sweet flavors that arise with aging. Here we isolated a novel strain of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> from hibiscus flowers in Okinawa, HC02-5-2, that produces high levels of alcohol. The whole-genome information revealed that strain HC02-5-2 is contiguous to wine yeast strains in a phylogenic tree. This strain also exhibited a high productivity of 4-vinyl guaiacol (4-VG), which is a precursor of vanillin known as a key flavor of aged awamori. Although conventional awamori yeast strain 101-18, which possesses the <italic>FDC1</italic> pseudogene does not produce 4-VG, strain HC02-5-2, which has the intact <italic>PAD1</italic> and <italic>FDC1</italic> genes, has an advantage for use in a novel kind of awamori. To increase the contents of initial scented fruity flavors, such as isoamyl alcohol and isoamyl acetate, we attempted to breed strain HC02-5-2 targeting the <sc>L</sc>-leucine synthetic pathway by conventional mutagenesis. In mutant strain T25 with <sc>L</sc>-leucine accumulation, we found a hetero allelic mutation in the <italic>LEU4</italic> gene encoding the Gly516Ser variant &#x003b1;-isopropylmalate synthase (IPMS). IPMS activity of the Gly516Ser variant was less sensitive to feedback inhibition by <sc>L</sc>-leucine, leading to intracellular <sc>L</sc>-leucine accumulation. In a laboratory-scale test, awamori brewed with strain T25 showed higher concentrations of isoamyl alcohol and isoamyl acetate than that brewed with strain HC02-5-2. Such a combinatorial approach to yeast isolation, with whole-genome analysis and metabolism-focused breeding, has the potentials to vary the quality of alcoholic beverages.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>comparative genomics</kwd><kwd>hibiscus yeast</kwd><kwd><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>breeding</kwd><kwd>awamori</kwd><kwd>liquor flavors</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="29"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Awamori, a distilled alcoholic beverage made from steamed rice, is brewed primarily in Okinawa, Japan. This traditional spirit, with more than 600 years of history, is representative of Okinawan culture and industry. Two microorganism species, the fungus <italic>Aspergillus luchuensis</italic> and the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> play essential roles in awamori brewing. <italic>A. luchuensis</italic>, as Kuro-koji mold, saccharifies steamed rice, and subsequently <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> produces ethanol by multiple parallel fermentations. After 2 weeks of fermentation, the fermented mash (<italic>moromi</italic>), containing ethanol at a final concentration of approximately 20% (v/v), is obtained and applied to the distillation process to develop a rich and strong flavor. Awamori is composed of various aromatic compounds, which are distinguishable from other types of Japanese spirits (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Nishiya, 1980</xref>). Two categories of flavors have been well studied in awamori: the initial volatile compounds commonly known as the &#x0201c;top notes&#x0201d; of flavors and the flavors that develop during the aging process (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Koseki et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Taira et al., 2012</xref>). These fruity and sweet flavors are favorable and demanded by consumers. For the awamori industry, it is important to enhance these two categories of flavors.</p><p>The initial volatile compounds, including fruity aroma esters and alcohols are recognized as important flavors in awamori (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Taira et al., 2012</xref>). In particular, the biosynthetic pathway of isoamyl alcohol and its acetate, isoamyl acetate, is elucidated as follows. These metabolites are synthesized from &#x003b1;-ketoisocaproate (KIC), a precursor of <sc>L</sc>-leucine, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Isoamyl alcohol is synthesized from KIC catalyzed by &#x003b1;-keto acid decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase, and is finally converted into isoamyl acetate by alcohol acetyltransferase. In the <sc>L</sc>-leucine synthetic pathway, &#x003b1;-isopropylmalate synthase (IPMS; the <italic>LEU4</italic> gene product) (EC 4.1.3.12) is the key enzyme, because its activity is regulated by feedback inhibition by <sc>L</sc>-leucine (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Baichwal et al., 1983</xref>). Previously, we isolated a mutant of the diploid awamori yeast strain 101-18, which accumulated a higher amount of <sc>L</sc>-leucine selected from the <sc>L</sc>-leucine analog 5,5,5-trifluoro-<sc>DL</sc>-leucine (TFL)-resistant colonies. The mutant strain 101-T55 has mutations in the <italic>LEU4</italic> gene, which confers overproduction of isoamyl alcohol and isoamyl acetate (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Takagi et al., 2015</xref>). Such yeast breeding technology targeted to specific flavors is applicable to the improvement of the quality of awamori.</p><p>Vanillin, which is regarded as a representative flavor of aged awamori, gives a sweet vanilla scent (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Koseki et al., 1996</xref>). Vanillin is converted from 4-vinyl guaiacol (4-VG), which is produced mainly by koji mold assimilating ferulic acid during awamori fermentation (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Koseki et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Maeda et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the <italic>PAD1</italic> and <italic>FDC1</italic> genes play essential roles in catalyzing the decarboxylation of ferulic acid (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Mukai et al., 2010</xref>). However, awamori yeast strain 101-18 has the <italic>FDC1</italic> pseudogene with a nonsense mutation, leading to the loss of 4-VG-producing activity (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Mukai et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the isolation or construction of a yeast strain with a functional ferulic acid decarboxylase is anticipated in order to brew novel awamori.</p><p>Our objective is to develop a new kind of awamori characterized by the top notes of flavors and altered flavors during aging. It is considered that yeast metabolism greatly influences the contents of isoamyl acetate and vanillin, known as the key flavor compounds in awamori. For awamori brewing, an awamori yeast strain of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Awamori 101, which is a diploid prototroph (supplied by National Research Institute of Brewing, Japan), has been dominantly used as a standard and conventional strain among awamori breweries. Strain 101-18 with high alcohol productivity has been isolated from Awamori 101 and is applicable for genetic analysis and awamori fermentation test (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Takagi et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, several types of awamori have been manufactured and commercialized by awamori brewery, which brewed by use of yeast strains derived and isolated from nature in Okinawa, such as mango and brown sugar lump. These unique awamori possess the different characteristics in taste and flavor compared to those prepared by conventional yeast strain. However, there has been little study done concerning the genetic analysis of newly isolated yeast strains. Therefore, it is important to clarify the genetic differences between the novel yeast strain and the other conventional yeast strains. In this study, we aimed to isolate and characterize a new yeast strain that has the potential to promote the production of these compounds in awamori brewing. To achieve this, we applied combinatorial methods for the isolation and breeding of a new yeast strain. We also presented the whole-genome information on yeast strains for awamori to uncover the molecular basis of its fermentation properties.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Culture Media</title><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells were cultured in a nutrient rich medium YPD (2% glucose, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone). A synthetic defined medium SD+Am [2% glucose, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without ammonium sulfate and amino acids (Difco Laboratories)] was used for analysis of intracellular amino acid contents in yeast. A SD medium containing 0.5% allantoin as a sole nitrogen source (SD+Alt) was used for selection of HC02-5-2 mutants resistant to TFL.</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of Yeast Strains for Awamori Brewing From Hibiscus Flowers</title><p>Wild hibiscus flowers (totally 23) were collected in Okinawa, Japan. The flowers were incubated in YPD medium containing 4% ethanol at 32&#x000b0;C. The resultant muddy media suspension was then incubated on YPD agar plates at 32&#x000b0;C. After 24&#x02013;48 h incubation, 5 of well-grown single colonies were picked and subsequently applied to a laboratory-scale fermentation test to select yeast strains with high ethanol productivity. The genomic DNA was extracted from yeast cells that produced high concentrations of ethanol by a laboratory-scale fermentation test. PCR was performed to amplify a part of 26S rDNA region (560 bp). PCR was conducted with the following primers: NL1 (5&#x02032;-GCA TAT CAA TAA GCG GAG GAA AAG-3&#x02032;) and NL4 (5&#x02032;-GGT CCG TGT TTC AAG ACG G-3&#x02032;).

In brief, 50 g of rice koji, 65 ml of water, and 0.1 ml of precultured yeast cells were mixed in a 200 ml Erlenmeyer flask. The fermented mash was incubated at 25&#x000b0;C for 14 days to prepare final fermented mash (<italic>moromi</italic>). After filtration of the supernatant of <italic>moromi</italic>, ethanol concentrations were analyzed using portable alcohol detector (AL-3; Riken Keiki). To analyze the production of flavor, the distillation of <italic>moromi</italic> was performed by atmospheric distillation using a water distiller (MH943SBS; Megahome) and stopped when the ethanol concentration reached 10%. The distillate was collected and subjected to liquid chromatography and gas chromatography according to the below methods.</p></sec><sec><title>Liquid and Gas Chromatography Analysis</title><p>Quantification of 4-VG was performed using Shimadzu HPLC system. Distilled awamori liquids were passed with a 0.45 &#x003bc;m-pore filter. The filtrated samples were loaded on the C18 column and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with an acetic buffer containing methanol. The elution was started with solvent A (50 mM acetic acid, pH4) and gradually increasing solvent B (100% methanol) up to 90%. On chromatogram at 254 nm of absorbance, the peak of 4-VG was detected at the same retention time as the standard solution. The peak area was calculated and the concentrations were determined by comparing to the standard solution.</p><p>The volatile compounds were analyzed using the electric nose of Heracles II system (Alpha MOS). The system composed of the solid phase absorption of vapor from samples, the dual gas chromatography columns and the FID detection. The distilled liquids from the laboratory scale fermentation were diluted with distilled water and prepared in 15% alcohol. Each 10 ml sample in glass vials was set on the equipment. The analysis was performed according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s installation instruction. The volatile compounds were quantified by comparing the peak areas with the standards.</p></sec><sec><title>Genome Sequencing and Phylogenic Analysis</title><p>The extracted genome DNA from wild-type strain HC02-5-2 isolated from hibiscus flower, its mutant strain T25, and Japanese sake strain Kyokai no.7 (K7) underwent quantification by Qubit (Thermo). Next generation sequencing library was constructed for each genome using the Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The genome libraries were sequenced using MiSeq (Illumina) with MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 or v3 (Illumina). Sequencing data processing of strains HC02-5-2, T25, and K7, as well as sequencing data from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) was performed with CLC Genomics Workbench v 10.1.1 (QIAGEN). This included trimming, mapping, and variants calling against the reference genome of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> S288c (GCA_000146045). Reads bases not matching in the alignment were scored as variants. The coverage table files and the variants table files were exported from Genomics Workbench and retained for further analysis. These files were converted to a fasta file of synthetic sequences with custom scripts<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01">1</xref></sup>. These scripts generate the sequences of homozygous SNPs from the data of coverage and variants. The fasta file was applied to the phylogenetic analysis with the Neighbor-joining method using MEGA X: Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>).

By brewing with strain 18-T55, which overproduces isoamyl alcohol and isoamyl acetate, a new kind of awamori has been sucessfully commercialized. Therefore, to give distinctive characteristics to hibiscus yeast HC02-5-2, we attempted to isolate the TFL-resistant mutants that accumulate intracellular <sc>L</sc>-leucine.

Since demands to expand the diversity of awamori qualities have increased, the development of novel yeast strains that vary in taste and flavor may contribute to the awamori industry. In this study, we found that novel yeast strain HC02-5-2, isolated from hibiscus flowers, produced enough ethanol for awamori brewing. In fact, &#x0201c;Hibiscus Awamori&#x0201d;, a new kind of awamori brewed with strain HC02-5-2, has been sold on the Japanese market. Subsequent breeding of strain HC02-5-2 succeeded in obtaining the desirable mutant T25, which produces more isoamyl alcohol and isoamyl acetate than HC02-5-2, which imbue awamori with fruity flavors. In a pilot-scale fermentation, greater amounts of isoamyl alcohol and isoamyl acetate were produced in awamori fermented by strain T25 than in those produced by strain 101-18 (data not shown). Our data indicate that strains HC02-5-2 and T25 are suitable for awamori brewing.</p><p>Strain HC02-5-2 produced more 4-VG producion than strain 101-18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). For several alcoholic beverages, such as beer, 4-VG is recognized as phenolic off flavor (POF). A comparative study revealed that the yeast strains with strong domestication like beer strains exhibit the POF negative phenotype (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Gallone et al., 2016</xref>). In awamori, 4-VG is known as a precursor compound of vanillin, which confers sweet vanilla flavor and is characteristic of aged awamori (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Maeda et al., 2018</xref>). During storage, awamori flavors are commonly believed to change, and storage methods for beneficial aging have been established (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Kanauchi, 2012</xref>). One of the molecular bases for awamori aging is explained by the conversion of 4-VG into vanillin (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Koseki et al., 1996</xref>). Therefore, strain HC02-5-2 is suggested to have a distinct feature for awamori brewing, whereas strain 101-18 is a POF-negative strain with a nonsense mutation in the <italic>FDC1</italic> gene.</p><p>The initial scented fruity flavors are preferable to awamori and sake consumers. Several studies have increased fruity aromatic compounds in Japanese sake by introducing spontaneous one or mor mutations into industrial yeast strains (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Arikawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et al., 2017</xref>). We recently reported that <sc>L</sc>-leucine analog-resistant mutants overproduced isoamyl alcohol and isoamyl acetate (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Takagi et al., 2015</xref>). Since strain HC02-5-2 showed no striking features in initial volatile compounds, we expected to breed this yeast strain for a diversity of tastes and flavors. As a result, the obtained mutant strain T25 with <sc>L</sc>-leucine accumulation produced more isoamyl alcohol and isoamyl acetate than its parent strain HC02-5-2. It is known that an increase in <sc>L</sc>-leucine leads to high-levels of isoamyl acetate production (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ashida et al., 1987</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Quilter et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Takagi et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, strain T25 produced mor isoamyl acetate than strain HC02-5-2 did. Isoamyl acetate is converted mainly from isoamyl alcohol catalyzed by alcohol acetyltransferase (the <italic>ATF1</italic> gene product) in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Inoue et al., 1997</xref>). In the present study, we did not observe any sequence difference in the <italic>ATF1</italic> gene between strains HC02-5-2 and T25. Further investigation is needed to understand the mechanism by which strain T25 overproduces isoamyl acetate.</p><p>Interestingly, strain T25 produced approximately 3 times more <sc>L</sc>-leucine than the parent strain, whereas intracellular levels of <sc>L</sc>-valine and <sc>L</sc>-isoleucine in strain T25 were decreased to about 30 and 70% of those observed in the parent strain, respectively. Previous studies have shown that the balance of intracellular amino acids is tightly controlled in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Watson, 1976</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Messenguy et al., 1980</xref>). Moreover, <sc>L</sc>-valine and <sc>L</sc>-isoleucine, which are categorized as branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) containing <sc>L</sc>-leucine are bioynthesized by commonly sharing the same enzymes (acetolactate synthase, acetohydroxiacid reductoisomerase, and dihydroxiacid dehydratase) in the first four steps in mitochondria (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Kohlhaw, 2003</xref>). It is possible that an increase in <sc>L</sc>-leucine accounts for a decrease in other BCAAs in yeast cells. We found that <sc>L</sc>-leucine accumulation in strain T25 is caused by expression of the Gly516Ser variant of IPMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). IPMS is the key enzyme that regulates <sc>L</sc>-leucine biosynthesis via the mechanism of negative feedback inhibition by <sc>L</sc>-leucine in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Homology modeling analysis suggests that Gly516 is located on &#x003b1; 14 helix comprising the <sc>L</sc>-leucine binding site, which is the allosteric regulation domain with <sc>L</sc>-leucine in the bacterial IPMS (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Koon et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, the amino acid change of Gly to Ser at position 516 in IPMS was supposed to directly interfere with <sc>L</sc>-leucine binding due to the steric hindrance at the binding cleft, leading to the desensitization of the <sc>L</sc>-leucine feedback inhibition of IPMS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, newly isolated strain HC02-5-2 from hibiscus flowers was identified as a <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain related to the wine lineage of this species. Strains HC02-5-2 and its mutant T25 possess favorable characteristics for developing both the initial scented fruity flovors and the sweet flavors associated with aging. Our data supported the practical use of these isolated yeast strains. Moreover, we can now explore the certain molecular basis of fermentation properties of these strains. Since spirits contain many fragrant ingredients and their balance detrmines the quality, it is important to control multiple flavor compounds. This combinatorial approach to yeast isolation from nature and its breeding is applicable to the variation of the quality of alcoholic beverages in the fermentation industry.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>DW, MT, and HT conceived the study and designed the experiments.
