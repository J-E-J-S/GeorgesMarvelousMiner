    "Modern breeding imposed selection for improved productivity that largely influenced the frequency of superior alleles underpinning traits of breeding interest. Therefore, molecular diagnosis for the allelic variations of such genes is important to manipulate beneficial alleles in wheat molecular breeding. We analyzed a diversity panel largely consisted of advanced lines derived from synthetic hexaploid wheats for allelic variation at 87 functional genes or loci of breeding importance using 124 high-throughput KASP markers. We also developed two KASP markers for water-soluble carbohydrate genes (TaSST-D1 and TaSST-A1) associated with plant height and thousand grain weight (TGW) in the diversity panel. KASP genotyping results indicated that beneficial alleles for genes underpinning flowering time (Ppd-D1 and Vrn-D3), thousand grain weight (TaCKX-D1, TaTGW6-A1, TaSus1-7B, and TaCwi-D1), water-soluble carbohydrates (TaSST-A1), yellow-pigment content (Psy-B1 and Zds-D1), and root lesion nematodes (Rlnn1) were fixed in diversity panel with frequency ranged from 96.4 to 100%. The association analysis of functional genes with agronomic and biochemical traits under well-watered (WW) and water-limited (WL) conditions revealed that 21 marker-trait associations (MTAs) were consistently detected in both moisture conditions. The major developmental genes such as Vrn-A1, Rht-D1, and Ppd-B1 had the confounding effect on several agronomic traits including plant height, grain size and weight, and grain yield in both WW and WL conditions. The accumulation of favorable alleles for grain size and weight genes additively enhanced grain weight in the diversity panel. Graphical genotyping approach was used to identify accessions with maximum number of favorable alleles, thus likely to have high breeding value. These results improved our knowledge on the selection of favorable and unfavorable alleles through unconscious selection breeding and identified the opportunities to deploy alleles with effects in wheat breeding."
