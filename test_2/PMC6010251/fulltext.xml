Various pooled CRISPR libraries have been shared for CRISPR screens and useful tools have been developed to construct researcher&#x02019;s own libraries, however, many researchers are struggling to create their own pooled CRISPR libraries: it is a time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive process. In this study, we develop a simple method to customize conventional pooled CRISPR libraries using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. We show that conventional pooled CRISPR libraries can be modified by eliminating gRNAs that target positive genes, enabling the identification of unknown target genes in CRISPR screening. CRISPR/Cas9 system can be applied as a precise tool for customizing conventional pooled CRISPR libraries and will broaden the scope of high-throughput screening technology.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016R1D1A1A02937096</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9334-4333</contrib-id><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Yongsub</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017M3A9B4062419</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9334-4333</contrib-id><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Yongsub</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016R1A6A3A04009014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kweon</surname><given-names>Jiyeon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (2016R1D1A1A02937096, 2017M3A9B4062419, and 2016R1A6A3A04009014) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ernd.nrf.re.kr/">https://ernd.nrf.re.kr/</ext-link>).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All targeted deep sequencing data were deposited at the Sequence Reads Archive database of the NCBI with accession number SRP133450.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All targeted deep sequencing data were deposited at the Sequence Reads Archive database of the NCBI with accession number SRP133450.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Various pooled libraries, such as shRNA and cDNA libraries, have been developed for high-throughput functional studies[<xref rid="pone.0199473.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Currently, the Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 technology for genome engineering is evolving rapidly[<xref rid="pone.0199473.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and CRISPR-based pooled libraries are widely used in high-throughput functional studies to understand various biological processes[<xref rid="pone.0199473.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The pooled CRISPR library, comprising guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting individual genes in the genome, is used with Cas9 or Cas9 variants in loss-of-function or gain-of-function studies[<xref rid="pone.0199473.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199473.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although several groups provide pooled CRISPR libraries via the non-profit company, Addgene, researchers still require customized libraries for their investigations[<xref rid="pone.0199473.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Since the generation of new libraries for researcher&#x02019;s own study is a time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive process, we developed an innovative method for customizing conventional pooled CRISPR libraries. We show that the sequence-specific depletion of desired gRNAs from conventional CRISPR libraries is possible and these gRNA-depleted libraries can be used for high-throughput screening. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 81 gRNAs, targeting 27 kinase genes related to the targets of FDA-approved drugs can be simultaneously eliminated from pooled CRISPR libraries. Based on our results, Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) can be employed to customize conventional pooled CRISPR libraries for use in various biological screening procedures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Purification of Cas9 proteins and <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription of rc-gRNAs</title><p>Recombinant Cas9 proteins were expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA agarose beads.

Since all plasmid DNA in the pooled CRISPR libraries had the same PAM sequence, we assumed that the potential off-target effect could be determined only by the mismatch tolerance of rc-gRNAs. Generally, pooled CRISPR libraries are designed to minimize potential off-target effects on the genome, in order that the gRNA nucleotide sequences contained therein are not similar[<xref rid="pone.0199473.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Additionally, more than 3-bp mismatches between gRNA and target sequence can be distinguished by Cas9 nucleases, which can inhibit the off-target effects[<xref rid="pone.0199473.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We examined whether there were gRNAs with sequences similar to those of the six <italic>HPRT1</italic> gRNAs in the GeCKOv2 libraries and in fact, there was 1 gRNA with 5-bp mismatches and 21 gRNAs with 6-bp mismatches with the gRNAs (Table A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199473.s001">S1 File</xref>).

These results showed that Cas9 RNPs could successfully eliminate specific gRNAs-encoding plasmids DNA from conventional CRISPR libraries and the potential off-target effect of Cas9 RNPs were not of concern while using well-defined pooled CRISPR libraries.</p><p>To determine whether the gRNA-depleted library could be used for functional studies, we performed 6-thioguanine (6-TG) screening with the wild-type and the <italic>HPRT1</italic>-depleted libraries. As 6-TG is cytotoxic to <italic>HPRT1-</italic>expressing cells, <italic>HPRT1</italic> gRNAs result in positive hits in 6-TG screening because they disrupt <italic>HPRT1</italic> and make cells resistant to 6-TG[<xref rid="pone.0199473.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199473.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Lentiviral particles were produced from the wild-type and the <italic>HPRT1</italic>-depleted libraries and transduced into a HeLa-Cas9 stable cell line. To measure relative quantities of gRNAs in the infected cells, genomic DNA was isolated from these cells and analyzed by targeted deep sequencing at a depth of over 80-fold. Similar to the findings on plasmid DNA, of 123,411 gRNAs, only <italic>HPRT1</italic> gRNAs were dramatically depleted in two independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199473.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199473.s002">S1 Table</xref>).

To confirm that a set of gRNAs targeting each gene could be simultaneously depleted by Cas9 RNPs, we designed rc-gRNAs for 81 gRNAs targeting 27 human kinase genes, which were known to be the targets of FDA-approved drugs[<xref rid="pone.0199473.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Kinases are known to be potential therapeutic targets and their inhibitors are used as cancer-targeting agents[<xref rid="pone.0199473.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, recently, non-kinase targets of kinase inhibitors have been identified and they are gaining attention as new therapeutic targets[<xref rid="pone.0199473.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To construct a kinase-depleted library, 81 rc-gRNAs, which were simultaneously transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic>, and Cas9 proteins were treated together to GeCKOv2 library A as described below in the Materials and Methods section and the quality of the kinase-depleted library was assessed by targeted deep sequencing. The relative quantities of gRNAs showed that all 81 gRNAs in the kinase-depleted library were dramatically reduced compared with those in the wild-type library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199473.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199473.s004">S3 Table</xref>). This kinase-depleted library may be used for biomedical screening to identify new druggable target genes. Taken together, we show that Cas9 RNPs, comprising Cas9 proteins and <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed rc-gRNAs, could simultaneously deplete multiple gRNAs from conventional CRISPR libraries without off-target effects and the gRNA-depleted libraries could be used for high-throughput screening.</p><fig id="pone.0199473.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0199473.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Cas9 RNPs treatment for depletion of multiple gRNAs.</title><p>(A) Targeted deep sequencing analysis of the kinase-depleted GeCKOv2 A library.

Although previous studies show that Cas9 RNP can be used for eliminating unwanted DNAs such as mitochondrial rRNA in RNA-Seq libraries[<xref rid="pone.0199473.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199473.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], we first showed that Cas9 RNPs could deplete only gRNAs of interest and multiple gRNAs could simultaneously be eliminated in pooled CRISPR libraries. The advantage of our method over the generation of new libraries is its ability to reduce the time to construct a pooled library (Figure E in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199473.s001">S1 File</xref>). Furthermore, we presume this method can reduce cost and labour while removing up to 100 gRNAs (Figure F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199473.s001">S1 File</xref>). Interestingly, the deep sequencing results showed <italic>HPRT1</italic> gRNAs remained in the <italic>HPRT1</italic>-depleted library at low frequencies, but the <italic>HPRT1</italic> gRNAs were not enriched after 6-TG screenings using the <italic>HPRT1</italic>-depleted library. Based on these results, it appeared that the <italic>HPRT1</italic> gRNAs, interpreted as remaining in the <italic>HPRT1</italic>-depleted libraries, were either due to deep sequencing errors or did not exceed the threshold that could affect library screening.</p><p>Our method can be applied to genetic screening in diverse ways, for example, to exclude positive genes or gene sets in recessive screening for reducing the number of genetic screening rounds required to identify unknown target genes. Other types of Cas proteins which have different types of PAM sequences, such as Cpf1 with the T-rich PAM sequences, can be adopted to extend the usefulness of the method. Furthermore, this method is applicable to other library types, such as shRNA and cDNA libraries, with the potential to expand the availability of various pooled libraries in biomedical research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec008"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0199473.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Supplementary figures and tables.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0199473.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0199473.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Deep sequencing results of the <italic>HPRT1</italic>-depleted library.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0199473.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0199473.s003"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Deep sequencing results of the gRNA-depleted library (GeCKOv1).</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0199473.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0199473.s004"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Deep sequencing results of the 27 kinases-depleted library.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0199473.s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Heon Seok Kim and members of our laboratory for the helpful discussion of this study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0199473.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Boehm</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hahn</surname><given-names>WC</given-names></name>. <article-title>Towards systematic functional characterization of cancer genomes</article-title>. <source>Nat Rev Genet</source>. <year>2011</year>;<volume>12</volume>(<issue>7</issue>):<fpage>487</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>98</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrg3013">10.1038/nrg3013</ext-link></comment> .<?supplied-pmid 21681210?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21681210</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0199473.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name>. <article-title>A guide to genome engineering with programmable nucleases</article-title>. <source>Nat Rev Genet</source>. <year>2014</year>;<volume>15</volume>(<issue>5</issue>):<fpage>321</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>34</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrg3686">10.1038/nrg3686</ext-link></comment> .<?supplied-pmid 24690881?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24690881</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0199473.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Shalem</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sanjana</surname><given-names>NE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name>. <article-title>High-throughput functional genomics using CRISPR-Cas9</article-title>. <source>Nat Rev Genet</source>. <year>2015</year>;<volume>16</volume>(<issue>5</issue>):<fpage>299</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>311</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrg3899">10.1038/nrg3899</ext-link></comment> .<?supplied-pmid 25854182?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25854182</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0199473.ref004"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Shalem</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sanjana</surname><given-names>NE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hartenian</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Mikkelson</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
