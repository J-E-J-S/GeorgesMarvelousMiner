In the last few years, considerable importance was given to the research of somatic variants and several computational approaches were developed for this purpose. Despite continuous improvements to these programs, the validation of their results it&#x02019;s a hard challenge due to multiple sources of error. To overcome this drawback different simulation approaches are used to generate synthetic samples but they are often based on the addition of artificial mutations that mimic the complexity of genomic variations. For these reasons, we developed a novel software, Xome-Blender, that generates synthetic cancer genomes with user defined features such as the number of subclones, the number of somatic variants and the presence of copy number alterations (CNAs), without the addition of any synthetic element. The singularity of our method is the &#x0201c;morphological approach&#x0201d; used to generate mutation events. To demonstrate the power of our tool we used it to address the hard challenge of evaluating the performance of nine state-of-the-art somatic variant calling methods for small and large variants (VarScan2, MuTect, Shimmer, BCFtools, Strelka, EXCAVATOR2, Control-FREEC and CopywriteR). Through these analyses we observed that by using Xome-Blender data it is possible to appraise small differences between their performance and we have designated VarScan2 and EXCAVATOR2 as best tool for this kind of applications.

In the last few years, cancer genome projects have been properly devised to catalogue the diversity of DNA mutations present in different cancers via high throughput DNA sequencing of matched tumor-normal samples.</p><p>The principal aims of these projects are: (i) finding correlations between mutation profiles and clinical outcomes and (ii) identify mutations driving cancer progression and targets for novel therapeutic developments [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The discovery of these mutations, also called somatic variants, consists in finding variant alleles that are present in the tumor but not in the germline cells [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. By using this procedure, it is possible to identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs) [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194472.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], small insertions and deletions (InDels) [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and structural variants [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194472.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, proper identification of DNA mutations relies on the sequencing technology, data quality, and statistical methods used to analyze sequencing data [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In fact, despite the development of many bioinformatics pipelines and much effort to give standard rules for the assessment of good quality NGS experiments [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], no clear guidelines exist on how to practically analyze genome-sequencing data, as the optimization of somatic variant identification constitutes an important challenge in computational biology [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, several methods have been developed to discover somatic mutation [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], however, the validation of the results produced by these methods on real data is an hard challenge because no tumor genome has been completely characterized (i.e., with all real somatic mutations known). As a consequence, defining a gold standard for somatic mutation detection is fraught with challenges due to various sources of error such as artifacts occurring during PCR amplification or sequencing errors, incorrect local alignments of reads, tumor heterogeneity and sample contamination.</p><p>To overcome the lack of fully characterized tumor genomes several works proposed the use of simulation approaches to create synthetically mutated genomes by using reads simulation or downsampling of real sequencing data [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194472.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the first approach, reads are simulated on the basis of a probabilistic model and then enriched with &#x0201c;spiked-in&#x0201d; mutations [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Even if some of these methods are very sophisticated, they are not capable to model the full diversity of nonrandom sequencing errors. In downsampling, reads are randomly drawn from real sequencing data and used to create a new subsample by adding mutations at a desired allelic fraction (AF) [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Although these approaches are capable to simulate multiple subclones and sample contamination preserving the error profile of sequencing technologies, synthetic mutations can not completely mimic the complexity of genomic variations due to unpredictability of error events. For these reasons, we developed a novel software, Xome-Blender, that generates synthetic cancer genomes with user defined features such as the number of subclones, the number of somatic variants and the presence of CNAs, without the addition of any synthetic element.</p><p>The key idea at the base of our tool consists in using real sequencing data of normal individuals and subtracting reads that contain alternative alleles in heterozygous variants loci. By using this recipe, at each step of variants removal, we move backwards in tumor evolution process generating a subclone that is the progenitor of the starting sample. All the subclones are then subsampled at the desired fraction and merged to obtain a synthetic heterogeneous tumor sample matching the user requirements. In this way it is possible to simulate somatic SNVs and InDels with the desired AF. Moreover, exploiting a strategy based on adding or removal of reads, Xome-Blender is also able to generate somatic CNAs (sCNAs) of predefined length without altering the AF of single nucleotide and InDel variants.</p><p>In this work we demonstrated the power of our tool in generating tumor samples with different subclonal architectures and we used it to address the hard challenge of evaluating the performance of nine state-of-the-art somatic variant calling methods for small and large variants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Overview of current approaches</title><p>Computer simulation of genomic data has become increasingly popular for assessing and validating biological models or for gaining an understanding of specific data sets [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Improved computational methods and more efficient bioinformatic tools are constantly developed to provide faster processing and more accurate inferences. However, it is essential that these methods be benchmarked against existing tools with similar functionality, to show their superiority in at least some aspect.</p><p>In general, computational methods can be benchmarked using experimental and/or simulated genomic data, and although validation with experimental data is essential as it represents real scenarios, owing to the lack of complete knowledge on real experiments, it is very challenging to use them for the assessment of algorithm performance.</p><p>Alternatively, in silico simulations allow us to generate as much data as desired, under controlled scenarios and with predefined parameters for which the true values are known, thus nicely complementing validation with real data [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the last few years, simulation approaches have gained ground in cancer genomics due to the lack of guidelines for the assessment of good quality NGS experiments. In fact, despite the development of many bioinformatics pipelines and much effort to give standard rules to practically analyze tumor genome sequencing data, the error proneness of the sequencing platforms leads to the generation of biased reads that could invalidate the products of the analysis, making very hard applications such as the somatic variant calling. In fact, calling somatic variants is a harder problem than calling germline variants [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] because of variability in the number of somatic mutations, extent of tumor subclonality and effects of copy number alterations.</p><p>At present, computational methods for simulating cancer sequencing data can be classified in two main approaches: those based on synthetic reads generation and those on downsampling of real sequencing data. NGS reads simulators are based on probabilistic models that allow to generate sequences with &#x0201c;spiked-in&#x0201d; mutations and that mimic the attributes of different sequencing technologies, such as read length and error rate. These tools differ in several aspects, such as sequencing technology they simulate, input requirements or output format, but have several aspects in common. With few exceptions, all programs need a reference sequence (that can be a particular genomic region, multiple genomic regions that are concatenated, a chromosome or a complete genome.) and multiple parameter values that indicate the technological (i.e., insert sizes, read lengths, error rates and quality scores) and/or the biological (i.e., GC content, InDel rates and substitution rates) features of the sequencing experiment to be simulated. The reads produced by these tools can show user defined features such as type, length and number according to the sequencing technology assumed and the desired coverage. The read type can be specified directly or indirectly by defining particular insert sizes. By default, most simulators assume single-end reads [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Apart from sequencing errors, many tools can also introduce different types of genomic variants in the simulated reads [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], such as SNVs, InDels, inversions, translocations, copy number variants (CNVs) and short tandem repeats (STRs).</p><p>The general strategy is to create a mutated sequence by introducing genomic variants in the reference sequence before the generation of reads. In most cases, these variants are simulated using a given mutation rate, so the mutated sequence differs by a given percentage from the reference sequence; however, programs like DWGSIM [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and EAGLE [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] require a file with known mutations (in plain text, variant call format (VCF) or browser extensible data (BED)-like format).</p><p>Some programs are capable of generating population level diversity by creating several mutated sequences from a single reference sequence. Programs like GemSim [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and Mason [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] can generate sets of related haplotypes differing by at least one SNV from the reference sequence. In GemSim, users may also create their own tab-delimited haplotype file providing the specific position and mutation introduced. Although these methods are based on very sophisticated probabilistic models and allow to generate very complex genomic alterations, they are not capable to reproduce the nonrandom component of error profiles of real sequencing data.</p><p>In order to overcome the limits of synthetic sequences simulators, Cibulskis et al. [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] were the first to use the downsampling approach to create simulated dataset by randomly drawing reads from real sequencing data. The idea at the base of its approach is to exploit real cancer sequencing data with validated somatic mutations and randomly excluding reads from the original data until a desired depth of coverage is reached. Although the error profile of sequencing technologies are preserved, the repertoire and AF of mutations is limited to examples previously detected, and this approach can not reproduce intra-tumor heterogeneity and sample contamination.</p><p>More recently, Ewing et al. [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] developed a novel tool (BAMSurgeon) that takes the sequencing data of a normal sample as input and it randomly adds mutations at a desired AF. Although it allows the simulation of multiple subclones and sample contamination, the adding of synthetic mutations can not completely mimic the complexity of genomic variations due to unpredictability of error events.</p><p>At present, few publicly available tools can be exploited for the simulation of cancer genomes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0194472.t001">Table 1</xref>) and these include methods based on both downsampling or synthetic reads approaches. Although these softwares are capable to simulate several tumor genomic features, none of them allow to produce complex cancer samples with subclonal architectures and avoided by synthetic elements. tHAPMix, IntSIM and BAMSurgeon have automatic pipelines for the simulation of tumor subclonal architectures, while the other tools can perform this task by creating and merging different simulated samples. The great majority of these methods allow to only simulate small somatic variants (SNVs and InDels) with the exception of SCNVSim, EAGLE, IntSIM and BAMSurgeon that are capable to generate structural variants or CNAs only. Moreover, in all these methods, simulated variants are based on the addition of synthetic elements that do not mimic the sequencing technologies biases. Finally, only tHAPMix and BAMSurgeon are able to produce results in.bam format, while the other tools output reads in fasta/fastQ formats that need to be aligned against a reference genome.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0194472.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0194472.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Cancer simulation tools.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0194472.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0194472.t001"/><table frame="box" rules="all" border="0"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1"/><th align="center" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Variants</th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Output</th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SNVs</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">InDels</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CNAs</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Het</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FO</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BAMSurgeon</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BAM</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DWGSIM</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FQ</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EAGLE</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FQ</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GemSim</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FQ</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">IntSIM</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FQ</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mason</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FQ,FA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SCNVSim</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">tHapMix</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BAM</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t001fn001"><p>FA, FASTA; FO, format; FQ, FASTQ; Het, Heterogeneity.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>The tool</title><p>Xome-Blender is a collection of bash, R and C++ scripts based on SAMtools, Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK), VCFtools and Picard functions that allows to generate synthetic cancer genomes with user defined features such as the number of subclones, the number of somatic variants and the presence of CNAs, without the addition of any synthetic element.

This is performed by editing the variants pattern of the input BAM file by using a &#x0201c;morphological approach&#x0201d; that consists in the genotype switching of a set of variants (from heterozygous to homozygous) randomly chosen among those identified by GATK in the original input genome (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref> for more details). For each selected locus, genotype switching is conducted by iteratively replacing reads that contain alternative alleles with those carrying the reference one. By using this recipe, at each step of genotype switching, the &#x0201c;morphological approach&#x0201d; moves backwards in tumor evolution process generating a clone that is the progenitor of the starting sample without adding any synthetic element. Once all clones have been generated, the Xome-Blender module subsamples them, according to the desired percentages, to generate the subclones that are, finally, merged together to produce the synthetic heterogeneous sample. Optionally, CNA events of desired size can be added. While small variants (SNVs and InDels) produce local modifications of reads, events larger than read length (&#x02265; 100<italic>bp</italic>), such as copy number variants (duplications and deletions), generate an increase or decrease of coverage in duplicated or deleted regions. For this reasons, the simulations of such events need to be performed by removing or adding reads aligned to that region. Since single copy alterations arise from the deletion or duplication of a single allele, to simulate the allelic nature of CNAs the adding/removal step is performed by selecting reads with the same variants content (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Xome-Blender evaluation</title><p>One of the key feature of Xome-Blender is its capability to generate tumor genomes with complex subclonal architectures by downsampling the sequencing data of normal samples with SAMtools. In order to evaluate the capability of SAMtools to correctly rescale the coverage of sequencing data, we applied the subsampling method at the base of our tool to three whole-exome seqeuncing (WES) experiments produced by the 1KGP (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref> for more details). In particular, we downsampled ten different percentages (from 5% to 50%) for each experiment and we studied coverage distributions. The results summarized in panels A-B of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194472.g002">Fig 2</xref> show that our downsampling strategy is capable to extract the desired percentage of reads with high accuracy without affecting the global and local coverage of the resulting sequencing data.</p><fig id="pone.0194472.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0194472.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Xome-Blender evaluation.</title><p>The box plot a reports the variance of the ratio between the subsample and the full-sample coverage for each different percentage.

Small variants (SNVs and InDels) were selected by applying GATK HaplotypeCaller on the original WES experiments of the 1KGP and AF was estimated by means of B allele frequency (BAF), the ratio between the number of reads containing the alternative (B) allele and the total number of reads aligned to the variant position (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref> for more details).</p><p>The results reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194472.g002">Fig 2C&#x02013;2E</xref> and Figs A-B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194472.s001">S1 File</xref> show that there is high concordance between synthetic and expected AF for all the three variant classes, with SNVs that obtained the best Pearson correlation coefficient (<italic>R</italic> = 0.98) followed by insertions (<italic>R</italic> = 0.93) and deletions (<italic>R</italic> = 0.92). Remarkably, the absolute difference between synthetic and expected BAF is smaller 0.1 for almost 90% of SNVs and around 70% of InDels, and these results are slightly affected by sequencing coverages.</p><p>As reported in previous section, another unique feature of our tool is its capability to generate subclones with sCNAs of different size by adopting a strategy based on adding or removing reads. In order to examine the effect of the CNA-adding function, we used the third dataset and we estimated the CNA state of each sample by using the RC approach (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref>). The RC method is based on the idea that if the sequencing process is uniform (each read is sampled randomly and independently) the absolute number of DNA copies of any genomic region can be estimated by counting the number of reads that map that region.</p><p>For this reason, for each simulated alteration, we calculated the ratio between normalized RC of synthetic tumor and normal samples and we studied them as a function of sample contamination and sequencing coverage. The results reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194472.g002">Fig 2F</xref> demonstrate that our CNA-adding function is capable to reproduce, with high accuracy, sCNAs at different contamination levels and the correlation with the expected copy number state increases at the increase of sequencing coverage. Remarkably, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194472.g002">Fig 2F</xref> also reveals the different accuracy (higher variance) in the simulation of genomic regions involved in deleted or duplicated events and this can be mainly ascribed to the fact that the variance of RC data is lower for deleted states (zero or one copy) and it proportionally increases with copy number values. Taken as a whole, these results highlight how our tool is able to combine different sequencing data in any proportion, producing mixed genomes with the expected AF and CNA states, exploitable as heterogeneous samples for several kinds of applications, such as the simulation of the subclonal architecture of cancer genomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Somatic callers comparison</title><p>In order to demonstrate the usefulness of Xome-Blender we used it to address the hard challenge of evaluating the performance of several state-of-the-art small variants and sCNAs calling methods in WES experiments.</p><p>The identification of somatic variants is challenging due to multiple factors.

In particular, by using three 1KGP WES experiments we simulated a dataset of normal samples with ten different tumor contaminations (0%-10%) and a dataset of tumor samples contaminated with increasing level of normal tissue (0%-25%) and with 5000 somatic variants (for more details, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref>). Tumor data were simulated at sequencing coverage of 50&#x000d7;, 100&#x000d7; and 150&#x000d7;, while normal data at 50&#x000d7; and 100&#x000d7;. Somatic variant callers performance for SNVs, insertions and deletions were evaluated in terms of precision and recall on the following combinations of normal-tumor coverages: 50&#x000d7; vs 50&#x000d7;, 50&#x000d7; vs 100&#x000d7;, 50&#x000d7; vs 150&#x000d7;, 100&#x000d7; vs 100&#x000d7; and 100&#x000d7; vs 150&#x000d7;.

Globally, the results summarized in panels A-R of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194472.g003">Fig 3</xref> show that, for both SNVs and InDels, sample contamination and sequencing coverage have a weak effect on precision (panels A-M, C-O and E-Q) and a slight influence on recall, particularly on methods that do not allow to model the sample purity, such as Shimmer, BcfTools and Strelka (panels D-P and F-R). As expected, the higher the sequencing coverage and the higher the capability of somatic caller to detect all the true positive events. In the same way, the higher the tumor contamination (the percentage of normal tissue in tumor biopsy, panels F-R) and the smaller the recall.

Our analyses also show that VarScan2 obtains the best results in terms of precision and recall, followed by Shimmer, BcfTools, Strelka and MuTect/Indelocator. In particular, in the great majority of our analyses, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test based methods (VarScan2 and Shimmer) have the best combination of precision and recall, contrary to BcfTools, Strelka and MuTect/Indelocator that show high precision at the expenses of lower recall (expecially for SNVs). These results can be partly explained by the total number of events called by each method (Table A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194472.s001">S1 File</xref>). Table A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194472.s001">S1 File</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194472.g003">Fig 3A&#x02013;3R</xref> show that the number of detected events and recall rate are highly correlated, thus demonstrating that the poor performance of MuTect and Strelka (recall) are principally due to the fact that they identified a small number of variants with respect to the true positive events generated by Xome-Blender. For these reasons we decided to study the reciprocal overlap between the calls of the five methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194472.g003">Fig 3S&#x02013;3U</xref>). Around 80% of SNV identified by BcfTools, Strelka and MuTect are shared by more than two callers, suggesting that these methods mainly detect &#x0201c;highly confident&#x0201d; variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194472.g003">Fig 3S</xref>).</p><p>Nearly the same results are obtained for InDels detected by BcfTools and Strelka (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194472.g003">Fig 3T and 3U</xref>). The BROAD InDel caller (Indelocator) appears poorly performant compared to its SNVs counterpart (MuTect), because the module used for InDel calling is not part of the distribution of MuTect at the time of these analyses.</p><p>The variants detected by VarScan2 are shared by two, three, four and five methods in similar proportions. This result reflects a remarkable accuracy in the detection of both hard-to- and easy-to-find variants.</p><p>As a final step, in order to understand if the combination of different tool can improve global performance, we studied the precision and recall of union or intersection of variants detected by each caller. To this end, we intersected or merged callers results in all the combination of two, three, four and five methods. A summary of these analyses is reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194472.g003">Fig 3A1&#x02013;3L1</xref> and Figs C, D, E and F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194472.s001">S1 File</xref>. The most noticeable aspect that emerges from panels A1-L1 is the different effect produced by intersection and union.</p><p>In fact, the precision of the tools is positively influenced by intersection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194472.g003">Fig 3A1&#x02013;3C1</xref>) contrary to the recall that undergoes a considerable reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194472.g003">Fig 3G1&#x02013;3I1</xref>). On the other hand, the union of callers increase recall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194472.g003">Fig 3J1&#x02013;3L1</xref>) and decrease precision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194472.g003">Fig 3D1&#x02013;3F1</xref>). In particular, the effect of union and intersection is highly correlated with the performance of each method. Intersection has little effect on the precision of sensitive methods and large effect on precision of specific methods, while union has a reversed effect, increasing the recall of poorly specific callers and reducing the precision of the highly sensitive one.</p><p>A closer look at these results also shows that the best performance are obtained by combining VarScan2 and Shimmer by means of intersection (Fig C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194472.s001">S1 File</xref>).

The identification of these mutations, also called somatic variants, consists in finding variant alleles that are present in the tumor but not in the germline cells and is usually performed by using specifically tailored bioinformatics methods. To date, several computational approaches are available for this purpose, but the validation of the results produced by these methods it&#x02019;s a difficult challenge due to multiple sources of error and the lack of fully characterized tumor samples. To overcome these drawbacks, different simulation approaches are used but they are often based on the addition of artificial mutations that mimic the complexity of genomic variations.</p><p>Aware of this, we developed a novel tool, called Xome-Blender, useful to generate synthetic tumor samples devoid of artificial mutations. Our pipeline takes advantage from the usage of SAMtools, GATK, Picard and VCFtools which, besides being very widespread methods, act as a collection of functions that integrate with our scripts. The simulations made with our tool showed that it is able to produce complex and heterogeneous samples preserving the intrinsic features of real sequencing data. To prove its usefulness, we generated thousands of synthetic samples collected in a dataset used to compare the performance of 5 SNV and 4 CNA widely used somatic variants calling methods. Through these analyses we observed that by using Xome-Blender data it is possible to appraise small differences between their performance and we have designated VarScan2 and EXCAVATOR2 as best tool for this kind of applications.</p><p>In conclusion, our software is a useful tool for the creation of mixed samples exploitable for the benchmarking of novel somatic calling methods and subclonal architecture reconstruction algorithms.</p><p>At present, we are working on developing and evaluating methods for subclonal architecture reconstruction starting from a dataset made of Xome-Blender samples.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Ngs data</title><p>In this paper we used a total of four WES experiments produced by the 1KGP Consortium [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]: two samples of Caucasian (CEU) ancestry (NA12878, NA12889) and two of Yoruba (YRI) ancestry (NA18489, NA18501).</p><p>For all samples, whole-exome capture was performed by using the Agilent SureSelect All Exon V2 kit and sequencing was made by using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform.

<bold>BcfTools</bold> is a set of utilities that manipulate variant calls in the VCF and its binary counterpart BCF. SAMtools/BcfTools is probably the most commonly used algorithm for calling SNV, it calls SNV genotypes independently and its likelihood function assumes no Allelic specific expression (ASE). When read counts are very low, SAMtools/BcfTools may not call SNV genotypes [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<bold>Strelka</bold> takes as input the sequencing data files of tumor and normal samples in BAM format and by applying a Bayesian probability model define the most likely genotype. Variant detection is also based on a set of built-in filters based on factors such as read depth, mismatches, and overlap with InDels.</p><p>We skipped depth filtration for exome sequencing data as recommended by the Strelka authors [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>sCNA callers</title><p>The compared sCNA calling methods are the following (for more details on parameters configurations see Supplemental Materials):</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>
<bold>VarScan2</bold> identifies SCNAs by means of a three-step process, first compares BQ 20 read depths between tumor and normal samples for contiguous regions of coverage. After normalizing for the amount of input data (unique bases mapped), the relative copy number change is inferred as the log2 of the ratio of tumor depth to normal depth for each contiguous region. Then, it applies a circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm (Seshan and Olshen 2010) to delineate segments by copy number and identify significant change-points and finally, merges adjacent segments of similar copy number and classify them as either large-scale (&#x0003e;25% of chromosome arm) or focal events (&#x0003c;25%) [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<bold>EXCAVATOR2</bold> is based on the RC approach, unlike its previous version (EXCAVATOR), it enhances the identification of genomic CNVs (overlapping or non-overlapping exons) from WES data by integrating the analysis of In-targets and Off-targets reads. It&#x02019;s workflow starts with the RC calculation followed by the correction of the data for GC-content, mappability and exon size. After normalization, normalized read count (NRC) for each sample are organized according to the analysis mode (pooling or somatic) selected by the user: pooling mode to compare one sample to a pool of normal controls, somatic mode to compare one sample to its corresponding normal control. Finally, heterogeneous shifting level model (HSLM) is applied to segment the two combined profiles and FastCall algorithm classifies each segmented region into five possible states (two-copy deletion, one-copy deletion, normal, one-copy duplication and multiple-copy amplification). The results are provided as tab-delimited text files and as Figures for raw and normalized data, plots of segmentation and calling results [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194472.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<bold>CopywriteR</bold> allows for extracting uniformly distributed copy number information analysing In and Off-targets reads. It can be used without reference, and can be applied to sequencing data obtained from various techniques including chromatin immunoprecipitation and target enrichment on small gene panels [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>The sequencing data are analysed by means of three functions. The first function generates mappability and GC-content files for the provided bin size. The second function calculates compensated RCs, performs the mappability and GC-content-based normalization steps and applies a filter for regions of germline copy number variation. The results are provided in tab-separated format. The third function is optional and allows segmentation using CBS [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] as implemented in the R-package CGHcall 2.22.0 [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and plotting of the results.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<bold>Control-FREEC</bold> takes as an input aligned reads, then constructs and normalizes the copy number profile, constructs the BAF profile, segments both profiles, ascribes the genotype status to each segment using both copy number and allelic frequency information, then annotates genomic alterations. If a control (matched normal) sample is available, Control-FREEC discerns somatic variants from germline ones [<xref rid="pone.0194472.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Xome-Blender</title><p>The first module of Xome-Blender takes as input a single BAM file and basing on a set of user-defined parameters it produces a collection of alternative versions of the starting BAM, representing clones, and their respective VCF file.</p><p>Moreover, InXalizer calculates the coverage of the input file by using the <monospace>samtools depth</monospace> function and optionally creates a file containing the coordinates to insert CNA in the final product.

Optionally, it is possible to use a target file, in bed format, to edit only defined portions of the BAM file (whole-exome or target sequencing experiments). The InXalizer&#x02019;s outputs are then used as inputs for the second module, Xome-Blender. The first step of its workflow consists in parameter checking. In fact, as for InXalizer, it is possible to drive the blending process by setting two variables:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Percentages = the desired percentage of each subclone (including the control).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Final coverage = the average coverage of the final product.</p></list-item></list><p>If the values of these parameters are incompatible with the input data features (for example the &#x0201c;starting coverage&#x0201d; stored in the *.cov file), the process stops. Alternatively, it goes to the next step and it starts to subsample the clone BAM files (generated by InXalizer) to get the desired percentage of each of these and next it adds the CNA events, if a CNA file is provided.</p><p>The CNA adding function operates on each clone allowing to generate clone-specific events. In order to make a CNA, firstly, a BAM file of the interested region is generated. Next, all its variants are identified and the alternative reads aligned on these positions are stored in a new BAM file. Contemporary, a file containing the reference reads is generated and randomly subsampled at 50%. Both BAM are then sorted.</p><p>In case of deletion, it is necessary to proceed with a further step which involves the storing of all reads-in-region in a file common for all deletion events. At the end of the process all these reads are removed from the final product, producing deletions.</p><p>The resulting BAM files are then merged and indexed by means of the samtools <monospace>merge</monospace> and <monospace>index</monospace> functions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0194472.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Supplemental PDF file containing parameters configurations of calling methods, supplemental figures and supplemental tables.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0194472.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0194472.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
