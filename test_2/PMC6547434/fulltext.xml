Moreover, DENR depletion shortens circadian period in mouse fibroblasts, suggesting involvement of uORF usage and reinitiation in clock regulation. To identify DENR-regulated translation events transcriptome-wide and, in particular, specific core clock transcripts affected by this mechanism, we have used ribosome profiling in DENR-deficient NIH3T3 cells. We uncovered 240 transcripts with altered translation rate, and used linear regression analysis to extract 5&#x02032; UTR features predictive of DENR dependence. Among core clock genes, we identified <italic>Clock</italic> as a DENR target. Using <italic>Clock</italic> 5&#x02032; UTR mutants, we mapped the specific uORF through which DENR acts to regulate CLOCK protein biosynthesis. Notably, these experiments revealed an alternative downstream start codon, likely representing the <italic>bona fide</italic> CLOCK N-terminus. Our findings provide insights into uORF-mediated translational regulation that can regulate the mammalian circadian clock and gene expression at large.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Swiss National Science Foundation</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001711</named-content></funding-source><award-id>157528</award-id><award-id>179190</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Centre of Competence in Research</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Olga Mayenfisch Stiftung</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Fondation Herbette</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">University of Lausanne</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100006390</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">University of Zurich</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100006447</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Initiation is considered the rate-limiting step for eukaryotic translation&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and can be regulated by multiple mechanisms including through upstream open reading frames (uORFs), which are short translated sequences defined by a start codon within the 5&#x02032; untranslated region (5&#x02032; UTR) of the transcript and an in-frame stop codon. Canonical translation initiation involves association of the small ribosomal subunit with an mRNA&#x02019;s 5&#x02032; cap structure and scanning of the 5&#x02032; UTR until a start codon is recognized. In cases when this translation event is on a uORF, the ribosome can resume scanning after termination, allowing reinitiation at the downstream protein coding sequence (CDS). Alternatively, a scanning ribosome might skip certain uORFs, in a process known as leaky scanning. Translation reinitiation and leaky scanning are poorly understood mechanisms that may involve canonical and non-canonical initiation factors and that are likely regulated by specific features of the uORF and within the transcript (reviewed in (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)).</p><p>Density-regulated protein (DENR) and Malignant T-cell amplified sequence 1 (MCTS1) form a heterodimeric non-canonical initiation factor that has been described to bind to the small ribosomal subunit and to promote the eIF2-independent recruitment of the initiator tRNA to viral mRNAs, as well as to participate in the recycling of post-termination 40S subunits (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, DENR-MCTS1 was identified as a reinitiation factor required for efficient CDS translation on transcripts containing short and strong uORFs (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Furthermore, based on reporter assays with synthetic constructs containing uORFs of varying lengths and Kozak strengths, endogenous DENR targets have recently been predicted in human cells (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, an unbiased identification of DENR targets <italic>in vivo</italic> and a transcriptome-wide quantification of the effects exerted by DENR on translational regulation are still lacking.</p><p>uORF usage is pervasive in the mammalian transcriptome, with up to 40% of transcripts predicted to contain at least one uORF (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). It generally reduces CDS translation efficiency (TE) because scanning ribosomes are diverted from the main ORF and unlikely all reinitiate (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). We have previously reported that several transcripts encoding components of the circadian clock machinery contained translated uORFs (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Moreover, DENR loss-of-function&#x02014;as a means of globally interfering with uORF regulation&#x02014;shortened the period of free-running circadian oscillations in mouse fibroblasts by up to 1.5 h (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, it has remained elusive on which circadian clock transcripts and through which uORFs DENR can act.</p><p>Here, we have used ribosome profiling in mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts to identify and quantify DENR-mediated translational regulation transcriptome-wide, and in particular within core clock genes. We have used comprehensive regression analysis to characterize 5&#x02032; UTR features associated with DENR-dependent translational regulation and validate targets identified from our translatome-wide approaches. Finally, we show that DENR regulates efficient CLOCK biosynthesis involving a strong uORF and a so-far unannotated CDS initiation codon.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>NIH3T3 and HEK293FT cells were cultured under standard conditions (DMEM; 10% FCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, all from Invitrogen; 37&#x000b0;C; 5% CO<sub>2</sub>).</p><p>Lentiviral particle production in HEK293FT cells using envelope pMD2.G and packaging psPAX2 plasmids, and viral transduction of NIH3T3 cells, were performed following published protocols (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), with puromycin selection at 5 &#x003bc;g/ml for 4&#x000a0;days.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-2"><title>Cloning and plasmids</title><p>For the generation of lentiviral shRNA expression vectors, two different sequences targeting <italic>Denr</italic> were cloned into pLKO.1puro backbone vector (Addgene no. 10878 (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)): shRNA1: GTACCACAGAAGGTCACGATA, corresponding to clone TRCN0000308443 of the TRC shRNA Library from the Broad Institute; and shRNA2: GTGCCAAGTTAGATGCGGATT, corresponding to clone TRCN0000098826. pLKO.1puro constructs containing <italic>Gfp</italic>, and Scramble (Addgene no. 1864) shRNAs served as controls.</p><p>For the generation of dual luciferase (Firefly/Renilla) reporter plasmids, fragments containing the 5&#x02032; UTR and first 5-14 codons of the selected DENR targets/controls were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from genomic DNA or cDNA, cloned into the BamHI site of the prLV1 dual luciferase reporter plasmid (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and validated by sequencing.

The barcode is preceded by a 4-nt and followed by a 3-nt random sequence that serves as unique molecular identifier (UMI) to mark individual cDNA molecules. cDNA libraries were then PCR amplified (24 cycles) and subjected to high-throughput sequencing (Illumina HiSeq2500 platform).

Importantly, we considered only uORFs coding for at least two amino acids (i.e. 9&#x000a0;nt, including the stop codon), as for shorter uORFs frame bias assessment would be highly prone to false positives, and Kozak context scoring would be compromised (for 6&#x000a0;nt uORFs, the position +4 would always be the T of the stop codon, and thus cannot be a G of the strongest Kozak context).</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-8"><title>Multiple regression analysis</title><p>For the modelling, all transcripts containing translated uORFs in <italic>Denr</italic> knockdown or control cells were included (<italic>N</italic> = 4755) and the following 5&#x02032; UTR features were used as predictors of the fold change in CDS TE across conditions: (i) the number of uORFs, (ii) the uORFs length, using the median length in transcripts with several uORFs, (iii) the proportion of AUG uORFs, (iv) the uORF Kozak context, scored relative to the consensus GccA/Gcc###G, where upper-case letters denote highly conserved bases (scored +3), lower-case letters indicate the most common nucleotides (scored +1) and ### represents the start codon (not scored).

First, we compared CDS footprint levels for all expressed genes (<italic>N</italic> = 10&#x000a0;516, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, grey), and then selected the subset of transcripts that also displayed footprint coverage within the 5&#x02032; UTR (<italic>N</italic> = 5148, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, blue). Of note, the quantification of footprints from the full 5&#x02032; UTR can serve as a useful proxy for uORF translation&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), given that uORFs are considered the major source of 5&#x02032; UTR-mapping reads. This group of transcripts, thus presumably enriched for uORF-containing genes, showed an overall similar distribution as all genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). We concluded that the effect of DENR deficiency on this gene set did not markedly differ from the effect seen genome-wide, consistent with previous reports indicating that acute <italic>Denr</italic> loss did not lead to major global effects on translational output (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Next, we calculated the ratio of 5&#x02032; UTR-mapping to CDS-mapping footprints per gene, and determined how this measure of &#x02018;relative 5&#x02032; UTR translation&#x02019; was affected in <italic>Denr</italic>-depleted versus control cells. Our analysis revealed a striking increase in relative translation on 5&#x02032; UTRs in <italic>Denr</italic>-deficient cells, indicative of a redistribution of translating ribosomes within transcripts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1F</xref>). This effect was absent from the RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1G</xref>). Conceivably, these changes on the translational landscape may reflect complex alterations in initiation efficiency and uORF usage, and are in line with a role of DENR in translation reinitiation&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Translational remodelling that affects a sizeable proportion of the transcriptome is most consistent with a scenario in which DENR interacts with ribosomes at mRNAs with little, or no, sequence specificity. To address this question, we examined the direct interactions of DENR with RNAs <italic>in vivo</italic> by performing individual nucleotide resolution crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) of DENR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>). Over 85% of iCLIP reads mapped to ribosomal RNA, in particular to 18S rRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2B and C</xref>), with the five most prominent binding sites on helices 24-26a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2D and E</xref>). This outcome is in line with structural data that places the DENR&#x02013;MCTS1 complex in proximity to the mRNA channel within the small ribosomal subunit and that identifies helix 24 as a potential interface of MCTS1 with 18S rRNA (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Moreover, helix 26 has previously been reported to make contacts with sequences upstream of restarting AUG codons on viral RNAs (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In contrast, only 10.5% of iCLIP reads mapped to mRNAs, which was not sufficient to identify specific mRNA-binding sites. In summary, while we cannot exclude transient direct interactions of DENR&#x02013;MCTS1 with mRNAs, our iCLIP data are consistent with structural studies and support a model in which the complex binds close to the mRNA channel of initiating ribosomes at a location that could facilitate reinitiation when uORFs are present, but travels indiscriminately along mRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-2"><title>Decreased CDS translation efficiency, uORF enrichment and pathway analysis of DENR-regulated transcripts</title><p>From the shift in the distribution of 5&#x02032; UTR versus CDS footprints that were affecting a significant proportion of the transcriptome in <italic>Denr</italic>-deficient cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>), we wished to narrow down to the most-DENR-sensitive transcripts that were potentially direct and functionally relevant targets. We reasoned that changes in CDS translation efficiency (TE; defined as the ratio of CDS-mapping RPF-seq to RNA-seq reads) would represent an appropriate measure to identify such targets, as TE differences would alter the amount of protein produced from the transcript. We therefore calculated transcriptome-wide TEs and, given that there is currently no established consensus on the most suitable analytical tool for differential translation analysis, we then applied several available algorithms to detect significant TE changes. Briefly, the four methods we employed, Xtail (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), RiboDiff (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), Riborex (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and Babel (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), are all conceived for the quantification of translational changes that deviate from possible variations already occurring at the level of mRNA abundances. They differ in parameter estimation and modelling approaches, as well as in sensitivity, false discovery rates and computational speed. When applied using settings that maximize comparability of results (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section), we identified 240, 78, 41 and 30 genes that had a significant change in TE between <italic>Denr</italic>-deficient and control cells with Xtail, RiboDiff, Riborex and Babel, respectively (FDR &#x0003c; 0.1 for all four algorithms). Importantly, differential TE genes detected by Riborex, RiboDiff and Xtail completely overlapped, while only about half of the genes detected by Babel were also found by any of the other methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>). Moreover, most genes detected by Xtail, RiboDiff and Riborex showed decreased TE in <italic>Denr</italic>-depleted cells, as expected for the knockdown of a reinitiation factor, and they spanned the full range of expression levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3B,C</xref>). By contrast, Babel was biased towards low abundance transcripts and identified similar numbers of up- and down-regulated TE genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3B and C</xref>). We concluded that Xtail likely represented the most sensitive method to identify DENR targets, and further estimated the false discovery rate of the algorithm by randomly shuffling the dataset labels, which eliminated nearly all differential TE genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3D</xref>). Please note that, for simplicity, we shall further use the term &#x02018;DENR targets&#x02019; for the 240 differential TE genes identified by Xtail, although in the absence of information on direct DENR&#x02013;mRNA interactions, the term &#x02018;<italic>most DENR-sensitive transcripts</italic>&#x02019; would be more precise.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Characteristics of DENR targets: decreased CDS TE; enrichment for uORFs; association with functional categories.

In order to investigate whether the TE decrease among DENR-sensitive transcripts was associated with uORF translation, we annotated uORFs transcriptome-wide. Briefly, we included AUG and non-canonical, near-AUG (i.e., CUG, GUG, UUG) initiation codons located in 5&#x02032; UTRs, and assessed the active translation of the corresponding ORFs by their footprint coverage, frame preference and triplet codon periodicity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>). Using this approach, we detected translated uORFs in nearly half of all expressed genes (<italic>N</italic> = 4755 genes, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), consistent with previous predictions&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). For the majority of genes, the uORFs were fully contained in the 5&#x02032; UTRs (51.8%, <italic>N</italic> = 2464 genes), but genes with uORFs overlapping the CDS (19.5%, <italic>N</italic> = 926 genes), or that had both overlapping and non-overlapping uORFs (28.7%, <italic>N</italic> = 1365 genes) were frequent, too (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>). Notably, DENR targets were highly enriched for genes with translated uORFs (72.7%, <italic>P</italic> = 5.73e-4, Fisher test, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) that were non-overlapping uORFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>). The depletion of overlapping uORFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>)&#x02014;indicating that they are insensitive to DENR regulation&#x02014;is consistent with the idea that after terminating on an overlapping uORF, a ribosome would presumably not be able to backtrack to reinitiate on an upstream CDS start codon. Moreover, relative 5&#x02032; UTR translation in <italic>Denr</italic>-depleted versus. control cells calculated over the full 5&#x02032; UTR&#x02014;as a proxy of uORF translation&#x02014;was significantly higher for DENR targets than for the global set of uORF-containing genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4C and D</xref>). In summary, these observations were fully consistent with an involvement of DENR in reinitiation and in efficient CDS translation of a subset of uORF-containing mRNAs.</p><p>We next analysed whether specific functional pathways were over-represented among the 240 differential TE genes. GO term analysis revealed enrichment of categories associated with translation and mRNA stability, as well as cellular functions related to protein phosphorylation and catabolism, kinase binding and cell cycle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4E</xref>), in line with previous observations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and indicating evolutionary conservation of DENR functions.</p><p>Among the DENR-regulated transcripts were several relevant to cancer, such as <italic>Klhdc8a, Etaa1, Map2k5, Slc20a1</italic> or <italic>Vegfd</italic> (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39&#x02013;43</xref>). Individual inspection confirmed their reduced CDS translation efficiency (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), as well as a shift of ribosome occupancy from the CDS to the 5&#x02032; UTR in <italic>Denr</italic>-depleted cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This signature was characteristic of many differential TE genes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5A and B</xref>), and correlated with the presence of translated uORFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5C</xref>).

In <italic>Denr</italic>-depleted cells, translation of the first uORF (on <italic>Atf5</italic> and, to lesser extent, on <italic>Atf4</italic>) remained unchanged compared to control cells, while translation of the second uORF and the CDS were decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5D and E</xref>).

By contrast, we observed a stronger reduction in FL/RL signals&#x02014;of 49&#x02013;90%&#x02014;for four 5&#x02032; UTR reporters of presumed DENR target genes (<italic>Etaa1, Klhdc8a, Map2k5</italic> and <italic>Lrrc28</italic>), indicating that DENR was indeed involved in their regulation. Mutating uORF start codons increased reporter signal and abolished most DENR-dependence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, bottom), indicating that uORF translation was necessary for DENR dependance. Furthermore, in line with the view of DENR as a reinitiation factor, rather than a leaky scanning factor, the presence of a functional stop codon was required for DENR regulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5F</xref>). uORF-dependent regulation of <italic>Klhdc8a</italic> translation was particularly striking, with a &#x0003e;4-fold translation upregulation in WT cells with a uORF-less construct (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, bottom).

However, rules to predict specific mechanisms from specific uORF features have not yet been established. Our datasets could potentially enable the identification of signatures that render certain uORF-containing transcripts DENR-dependent.

We modelled the CDS TE change observed upon <italic>Denr</italic> knockdown using nine relevant transcript features, namely the number of uORFs, uORF start codon identity (AUG versus near-cognate) and context, the length, GC content and location of the uORF within the 5&#x02032; UTR, the presence of overlapping uORFs and CDS start codon context (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The model was applied to all translated uORF-containing genes (<italic>N</italic> = 4741) and yielded several features with significant predictive value for DENR-sensitivity of TE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">J</xref>; adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.057, <italic>F</italic>-statistic = 33.21 on 4731 DF, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 2.2e-16). Three of the identified features reflected the expected positive relationship between efficient uORF translation and a greater need for reinitiation to subsequently translate the CDS as well. These features were: the number of uORFs present on a transcript (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, <italic>b</italic> = &#x02212;0.019, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 2e-16), the presence of AUG, rather than non-canonical uORF start codons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, <italic>b</italic> = &#x02212;0.05, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 1.15e-9), and the strength of Kozak contexts around uORF start codons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, <italic>b</italic> = &#x02212;0.0026, <italic>P</italic> = 0.013).

Briefly, already early studies on a model transcript had suggested that the location of a uORF with respect to the main ORF could dictate the efficiency of reinitiation, as longer spacing would generally allow the reacquisition of initiation factors to the scanning ribosome (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Our model provides an unbiased and transcriptome-wide validation of this notion for DENR-regulated transcripts, where larger distances from the stop codon of the 3&#x02032;-most uORF to the start codon of the main ORF were associated with downregulation of TE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H</xref>); uORFs located further upstream from the CDS were thus more likely to reinitiate in a DENR-dependent fashion. Importantly, this effect of uORF&#x02013;CDS distance was not caused by longer 5&#x02032; UTRs <italic>per se</italic>, given that the distance from the 5&#x02032; cap to the first uORF was not associated with DENR regulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I</xref>, <italic>b</italic> = &#x02212;0.0018, <italic>P</italic> = 0.18). Of note, the uORF&#x02013;CDS distance was only weakly correlated with 5&#x02032; UTR length (Spearman rho = 0.16), whereas the correlation of the 5&#x02032; cap-first uORF distance with 5&#x02032; UTR length was more prominent (Spearman rho = 0.27, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7C and D</xref>).</p><p>No linear relationship was found between uORF length and CDS TE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>, <italic>b</italic> = 0.0006, <italic>P</italic> = 0.81), in agreement with previous results in human cells using synthetic uORFs encoding &#x0003e;2 amino acids (9&#x000a0;nt) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).

In summary, although the model explained only a relatively modest proportion of the total variance (see &#x02018;Discussion&#x02019; section), our results indicated that DENR was important to enable efficient protein synthesis when the transcripts contained uORFs initiating with AUG in strong Kozak contexts (i.e. uORFs expected to be highly translated), and that the distance between the most downstream uORF and the CDS start was an important parameter for efficient reinitiation.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-4"><title>DENR-mediated reinitiation regulates CLOCK protein biosynthesis</title><p>We recently found that uORF translation was pervasive within circadian core clock transcripts, and that the depletion of <italic>Denr</italic> in NIH3T3 cells engendered robust circadian period shortening by 1&#x02013;1.5&#x000a0;h (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).

The second uORF overlapped with the main CDS in a different frame&#x02014;a configuration that would render the two translation events (uORF-2 and annotated CDS) mutually exclusive. However, downstream of the uORF-2 stop codon and 10 amino acids into the annotated <italic>Clock</italic> CDS, we noted an additional AUG in the <italic>Clock</italic> coding frame. We thus hypothesized that, when uORF-2 was translated, initiation at this alternative AUG could still allow for the biosynthesis of a CLOCK protein variant that was N-terminally truncated by nine amino acids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). In <italic>Denr</italic>-deficient cells, translation was increased on both uORFs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">D</xref>) and, in particular, uORF-2 showed &#x0223c;23% higher translation rate upon <italic>Denr</italic> depletion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>), suggesting that DENR-mediated reinitiation after uORF-2 was crucial for the translation of the <italic>Clock</italic> CDS.</p><p>Using GWIPS-viz, an online genome browser for the visualization of ribosome profiling data from published studies (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), we looked for further evidence of uORF-2 and alternative CDS translation across mammalian datasets (of note, both annotated and alternative methionine residues are conserved across mammals, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). Interestingly, initiating ribosomes can be detected on both uORF-2 and alternative CDS start codons (but not the annotated <italic>Clock</italic> start codon) across human and mouse datasets, and elongating ribosome profiling studies showed good footprint coverage on uORF-2 and the characteristic accumulation of ribosomes at the start and stop codons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). Together, the published and our new data thus suggested abundant translation of uORF-2 and of <italic>Clock</italic> CDS from the alternative AUG, indicating that reinitiation has an important role in ensuring CLOCK protein biosynthesis.</p><p>In order to investigate uORF usage, effect, and DENR-dependence for CLOCK biosynthesis from the annotated and alternative CDS, we cloned the <italic>Clock</italic> 5&#x02032; UTR and first 14 codons (containing both the annotated and alternative AUGs) in frame and upstream of <italic>Firefly</italic> luciferase in our dual luciferase vector (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>, upper panel). We then systematically mutated the uORF-1, uORF-2 and CDS annotated/alternative start codons, or combinations thereof (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8F</xref>), and compared the effects on luciferase output in <italic>Denr</italic>-depleted versus control cells. Of note&#x02014;and in contrast to Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C&#x02014;we also adjusted for the effect of <italic>Denr</italic> depletion on the control reporter (whose levels were set to 1) to display the isolated effects of the <italic>Clock</italic> variants.</p><p>
<italic>Denr</italic> depletion resulted in an almost 30% reduction in expression for the <italic>Clock WT</italic> construct (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>, lower panel), in line with the decrease in relative translation quantified for the endogenous transcript (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>) and with reduced levels of endogenous CLOCK protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>). Surprisingly, mutation of the annotated CDS initiation codon did not substantially affect reporter levels and DENR dependence when compared to <italic>Clock WT</italic>. However, mutation of the alternative AUG decreased luciferase signal by &#x0223c;95% and abolished DENR dependence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>, lower panel), suggesting that most CLOCK biosynthesis in NIH3T3 cells involves the alternative AUG. Mutation of uORF-1 led to a 19% increase in luciferase signal and fully retained DENR dependence. By contrast, uORF-2 mutation led to a &#x0223c;50% increase in protein synthesis and eliminated DENR regulation. These findings indicated that uORF-2 translation acts to significantly reduce CLOCK biosynthesis and to render it DENR-dependent. This model was further supported by the combinatorial mutations. Mutation of both uORF-1+2 start codons thus resulted in an additive, &#x0003e;90% increase in protein synthesis, and in a loss of DENR-dependence. In line with minor levels of synthesis of the long CLOCK isoform, mutation of the annotated CDS start codon in combination with uORF mutations led to similar results as mutation of the uORFs alone. Furthermore, mutation of the alternative AUG in combination with uORF mutations led to strongly decreased luciferase signals, consistent with the predominant synthesis of the short CLOCK isoform. In particular, the case where both the alternative CDS and uORF-2 (or uORF-1+2) start codons were mutated&#x02014;a scenario that would allow unhindered CLOCK synthesis from the annotated AUG&#x02014;resulted in a &#x0003e;80% reduction in CLOCK protein production (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>, lower panel). Taken together, we concluded that <italic>Clock</italic> required DENR for efficient protein synthesis from a CDS that is 9 codons shorter than the annotated one, and that uORF-2 plays a key role in coordinating the complex interactions that occur at the translational level on the <italic>Clock</italic> transcript (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref>). Moreover, we propose that the CLOCK N-terminus is likely wrongly annotated not only in NIH3T3 cells, but based on our analysis of published ribosome profiling data, also in other cell types and in tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="SEC4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The annotation of translated uORFs has remained a particular challenge, because they are short, frequently initiate from non-AUG codons, and do not obey the same rules of evolutionary conservation as most protein coding sequences (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This has changed with the availability of ribosome profiling data, which has made it possible to systematically identify translated uORFs from footprints. The resulting burst in interest in uORFs and the rising appreciation of how prevalent their usage is in mammals, is, however, not yet matched by an understanding at the mechanistic level. In this study, we have investigated one particularly intriguing mechanism that is implicated in the regulation through uORFs, namely translation reinitiation. As an entry point, we have used the loss-of-function of DENR, a non-canonical initiation factor recently associated with reinitiation both in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and in HeLa cells (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), with the aim of identifying rules that explain why certain uORFs trigger DENR-dependent reinitiation while others do not. The conclusions we were able to draw from experiments in mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts showed similarities and striking differences to the previous studies in fly and in human cells (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Differences in experimental and computational approaches are likely to have contributed to the observed discrepancies. Moreover, species-specificity in uORF biology may underlie some of the disparities as well. In this context it is, for example, noteworthy that recent data from yeast suggest that reinitiation occurs as a consequence of a <italic>lack</italic> in DENR/MCTS-1 and EIF2D orthologues (the study uses the double knockouts) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), whereas studies in metazoans (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) suggest that DENR:MCTS1 promotes reinitiation&#x02014;a conclusion we would draw from our experiments as well. By contrast, the ribosome accumulation that we observe on 5&#x02032; UTRs in <italic>Denr</italic>-deficient cells is fully consistent with the yeast study that highlights the importance of EIF2D/DENR in ribosome recycling (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>We view our quantitative modelling approach of DENR-dependent changes in CDS TE as particularly unbiased as it relies on translational changes detected on endogenous mRNAs transcriptome-wide. Several features carry predictive value for the magnitude of DENR-mediated CDS TE regulation. Of these, three (number of uORFs, start codon identity, start codon sequence context) likely reflect a straightforward logic between a stronger requirement for reinitiation when the usage of uORFs is efficient. This outcome is expected and fully consistent with human (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and fly data (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) based on reporter assays. Two other outcomes from the model are noteworthy. First, uORFs located further away from the main ORF are more prone to trigger DENR-dependent reinitiation. Such intercistronic distance effects were reported early on in the uORF field, typically using distinct uORF-containing model transcripts (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). They had generally been assumed to reflect the kinetics of association and dissociation of initiation and termination factors. Our data validate this idea in a transcriptome-wide fashion and are in line with the hypothesis that longer distances allow for extended re-scanning times, which would be favourable for the loss of termination factors and/or the re-acquisition of the initiation machinery, on time for CDS translation. Second, it is noteworthy that uORF length lacks predictive value in our model. Although it is tempting to speculate that increased uORF length is therefore not linked to impaired reinitiation efficiency (at least for DENR-regulated reinitiation events), it should be kept in mind that the nature of our approach (transcriptome-wide from endogenous transcripts) did not allow to confidently annotate uORFs down to only 1&#x02013;2 amino acids in length. We may thus be missing DENR effects that have recently been observed in reporters carrying such ultra-short synthetic uORFs (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). We can evidently also not exclude that the time required for uORF translation in determining scanning resumption is relevant nevertheless, as linear length <italic>per se</italic> may simply not be a good proxy for translation time (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our model explains a relatively modest proportion of the total variance (adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of 0.057). This is reminiscent of analogous models that have been developed to predict, for example, miRNA target sites, whose adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>s range from 5 to 13%, but that have nevertheless proven biologically useful (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). In our case, the presence of multiple uORFs on a transcript, often overlapping each other, and each with its own, distinct features (start codon, length, distance to the CDS, etc), and the resulting combinatorial effects, clearly complicated their scoring and likely masked some of the origins of translational regulation. We deliberately wished to keep our model simple, aiming at identifying the most significant predictors, but at the expense of overall explanatory power. In the future, the use of other regression types and models that include interaction terms could potentially explain higher biological variability, although at the cost of becoming considerably more difficult to interpret. Overall, our study constitutes a first attempt to analyse signatures associated with reinitiation through DENR. It was already able to recapitulate previous observations&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), and as we continue to identify more molecular features that can regulate non-canonical translation initiation and that can be integrated into the model in the future, a larger proportion of biological variance will be explained.</p><p>We have identified 240 transcripts as particularly DENR-sensitive. Although we lack formal proof that they are direct DENR targets, the observations that (i) most of them show TE downregulation and few upregulation in the absence of DENR, that (ii) they are depleted for CDS-overlapping and enriched for non-overlapping uORFs, and that (iii) a DENR-dependent inhibitory effect of their 5&#x02032; UTRs can be rescued by uORF start codon mutations in reporter assays, all make a direct activity of DENR on these transcripts very likely. Moreover, these observations are all compatible with a role of DENR in reinitiation, but not in leaky scanning (which could have been an alternative interpretation of the redistribution of ribosomes from CDS to 5&#x02032; UTRs seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). In particular, we would not expect CDS-overlapping uORFs to be depleted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>), if DENR acted to regulate targets via leaky scanning. Moreover, mutating the uORF stop codon should not have had an influence on the DENR-effect in our reporter assays, if the activity of DENR consisted in regulating the efficiency of uORF start codon selection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5F</xref>).</p><p>Many identified DENR targets are involved in proliferation and associated with cancer. Of note, DENR-MCTS1 have themselves been identified as oncogenes (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) that are upregulated, for example, in prostate cancer (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Moreover, translational reprogramming, especially with regard to upstream initiation sites, appears to represent an important cancer driver (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), and understanding how the translation of cancer-relevant DENR targets is regulated may thus lead to important insights of diagnostic or therapeutic value. We found, for example, very strong DENR requirement for the translation of Kelch Domain Containing 8A (KLHDC8A). It has been reported that KLHDC8A overexpression in human gliomas that become resistant to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) silencing (a commonly used anticancer therapeutic approach), allows tumours to maintain aggressiveness through an unknown EGFR-independent pathway (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). It is conceivable that upon loss of EGFR sensitivity, KLHDC8A levels increase through DENR-mediated translational control. Similarly, other candidates from our DENR target list (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary File S1</xref>) are upregulated in (and possibly causally contributing to) different cancers, such as Vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGF-D) or Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 5 (MAP2K5) (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). By understanding how DENR regulates its targets, it may thus be possible to reduce reinitiation activity and thus the oncogenic levels of the modulated proteins in proliferating, but not in quiescent cells.</p><p>A comparison of DENR targets found in our and in previous studies returned little overlap. Of the eight targets validated in HeLa cells (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), only one (<italic>Tmem60</italic>) was expressed in NIH3T3 cells. <italic>Tmem60</italic> was predicted to undergo a 25% translational downregulation upon <italic>Denr</italic> loss-of-function and indeed showed a decrease in that range in reporter assays in HeLa cells (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), whereas in our system a &#x0223c;8% decrease in CDS TE of endogenous <italic>Tmem60</italic> was quantified. Moreover, for the ensemble of 104 predicted targets in human cells (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), &#x0003e;90% were not expressed in NIH3T3 cells or lacked a mouse orthologue; others (e.g. <italic>Lca5, Mllt11</italic> or <italic>Dsel</italic>) were indeed downregulated upon <italic>Denr</italic> knockdown, though to a lesser extent. Conceivably, DENR targets are species- and cell type-specific; moreover, it is likely that the differences in the magnitude of translational regulation observed across studies are the result of different experimental and analytical approaches.</p><p>How do DENR and circadian rhythms mechanistically connect? The DENR target list did not reveal core clock genes that would explain the circadian clock phenotype, i.e. the previously reported &#x0223c;1.5-h period shortening of free-running oscillations&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Individual inspection of core clock gene transcripts, however, suggested that <italic>Clock</italic> was a DENR target just below the significance threshold. Follow-up experiments confirmed <italic>Clock</italic> regulation through DENR and allowed mapping the responsible uORF. These findings establish uORF translation and re-initiation as a novel, potentially regulated mechanism acting on core clock gene expression, which opens several intriguing questions. First, is it possible that reduced biosynthesis of <italic>Clock</italic> would be responsible for the observed phenotype? Loss-of-function of a general gene expression machinery component typically goes along with sizeable distortions in global RNA and protein profiles, and <italic>Denr</italic> knockdown is no exception in this respect. Any phenotype thus likely represents a composite effect, rather than the result of a single misregulated gene expression event. We therefore do not view reduced CLOCK biosynthesis as a satisfactory hypothesis that alone would be able to explain the substantial period shortening. Nevertheless, it is reassuring that <italic>Clock</italic><sup>&#x02212;/ &#x02212;</sup> fibroblasts have recently been shown to have shorter periods as well (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), which suggests that downregulation of <italic>Clock</italic> translation upon <italic>Denr</italic> depletion may be a factor contributing to the phenotype.</p><p>A second intriguing question relates to the alternative initiation site that would generate an N-terminally truncated variant of CLOCK. We propose that the 9 amino acid shorter CLOCK is the main variant produced in NIH3T3 cells, and likely in other cell types and species as well. What are the functional implications? The bHLH domain responsible for DNA binding of CLOCK starts at amino acid 26, and the very N-terminus has not yet been associated with any function of the protein and is also not included in the crystal structure of the CLOCK-BMAL1 complex (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). However, it is noteworthy that for several myogenic bHLH transcription factors, N-terminal motifs are critical for cooperative DNA binding with cofactors (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Much of our current knowledge on CLOCK stems from <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments that have used <italic>Clock</italic> cDNA constructs devoid of the endogenous uORF regulation, and thus defining CLOCK&#x02019;s N-terminus to the annotated one. It will be exciting to re-evaluate selected DNA-binding and activity assays using both CLOCK isoforms side by side.</p><p>Finally, a speculative question to ask is whether DENR-mediated control is a regulated, rather than constitutive step in CLOCK biosynthesis, serving for example to uncouple CLOCK protein abundance from mRNA levels in specific cell types or under certain physiological conditions. Of note, there is precedence from <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> for uORF translation that mediates temperature-dependent regulation of biosynthesis of the core clock component FRQ (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). In the case of DENR, it is interesting that this protein was originally identified because its expression increased in cultured cells at high density, but not during growth arrest <italic>per se</italic>, which led to its name Density Regulated Protein (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). First links between cell density and circadian rhythmicity have indeed been described in recent years (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>), and it would be interesting to assess whether CLOCK uORFs and DENR play roles in determining density-dependent differences of clock parameters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="SEC5"><title>DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>High-throughput sequencing data was deposited to GEO, under accession number: GSE124793 (SuperSeries composed of ribosome profiling data: GSE116221 and iCLIP data: GSE124790).
