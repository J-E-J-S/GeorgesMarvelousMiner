    "We report here the draft genome sequence of Actinoplanes teichomyceticus CPCC 203265, a producer of glycopeptide antibiotic teicoplanin, which has signiﬁcant inhibitory activity against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens. The draft genome size is 8 Mb, with a G+C content of 72.8%, and its sequence will facilitate the genome exploration of novel secondary metabolites."
