Previously developed patent search techniques are first used to recover a set of patents that well-represent the genome editing domain before CRISPR. Main paths are then determined from the citation network associated with this patent set allowing identification of the three major knowledge trajectories. The most significant of these trajectories for CRISPR involves the core of genome editing with less significant trajectories involving cloning and endonuclease specific developments. The major patents on the core trajectory are consistent with qualitative expert knowledge of the topical area. A second set of patents that we call the CRISPR roots are obtained by finding the patents directly cited by the recent CRISPR patents along with patents cited by that set of patents. We find that the CRISPR roots contain 8 key patents from the genome engineering main path associated with restriction endonucleases and the expected strong connection of CRISPR to prior genome editing technology such as Zn finger nucleases. Nonetheless, analysis of the full CRISPR roots shows that a very wide array of technological knowledge beyond genome engineering has contributed to achieving the CRISPR breakthrough. Such breadth in origins is not surprising since &#x0201c;spillover&#x0201d; is generally perceived as important and previous qualitative studies of CRISPR have shown not only technological breadth in origins but scientific breadth as well. In addition, we find that the estimated rate of functional performance improvement of the CRISPR roots set is about 9% per year compared to the genome engineering set (~4% per year). These estimates indicate below average rates of improvement and may indicate that CRISPR (and perhaps yet undiscovered) genome engineering developments could evolve in effectiveness over an upcoming long rather than short time period.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009945</institution-id><institution>Merck KGaA</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5316-8358</contrib-id><name><surname>Magee</surname><given-names>Christopher L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Merck KGaA gave a research grant to MIT with the lead author (CLM) as the PI of the grant.

Just 5 years ago, CRISPR-Cas9 emerged as a much more economical, practical and generalizable genome editing technology. Since then it has become popular to refer to CRISPR as the most important biotechnology breakthrough of the 21<sup>st</sup> century [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and as one of the two (PCR being the other) most important biological technologies of the past 50 years [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Genome engineering is genetic engineering in which DNA is inserted, deleted, modified or replaced in the genome of a living cell or organism. Since there is not a consensus about differentiation, we -and most others- use genome editing as a synonym for genome engineering. There is consensus that CRISPR- an acronym for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats -and Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9) is the nomenclature for the signature protein for type II CRISPR systems that, directed by guide RNAs, cleaves DNA in a sequence-dependent manner. CRISPR (and Cas9) were discovered in bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] where they form the backbone for very effective viral resistance systems in numerous species setting the stage for other uses [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Lander in a paper retracing the history [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], Doudna and Sternberg in a memoir and historical book [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and more recently Urnov [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] all do an excellent job of covering the <italic>many strands of globally-dispersed scientific work</italic> (including discovery of CRISPR, its role as an adaptive immune system, experiments confirming the CRISPR role and showing use of a nuclease, adapting findings from earlier genome editing techniques, sorting out the importance of the various Cas proteins especially Cas9, cRNAs- or CRISPR RNA complexes, discovery of tracRNA, reconstituting CRISPR in a distant organism, studying CRISPR in vitro) <italic>essential</italic> to the initial sets of CRISPR patents. It is particularly interesting that many of these scientific research studies were undertaken for reasons having no biomedical intention (and often not focused on CRISPR or genome editing). This scientific story is fundamental to the emergence of CRISPR and the Lander article, the Doudna and Sternberg book and the Urnov article are recommended if one wants to understand it [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0198541.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0198541.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This paper does not emphasize the scientific literature but instead focuses on the patent literature associated with genome editing and CRISPR. We note that patents do cite scientific papers but scientific papers almost never cite patents so study of patents is an important element in the emergence and development of any technology. We also note that there are several legal conflicts about patents in this area and that the growth of relevant patent applications has &#x0201c;exploded&#x0201d; since 2012. The rapid growth and the legal conflicts do not&#x02013;in our judgement- eliminate the usefulness of assessing the technological core and roots of CRISPR in the patent system.</p><p>There is extensive development of methods, based upon analysis of patents that are aimed at improving understanding of technological developments such as CRISPR. This paper (to our knowledge the initial attempt to analyze CRISPR in this way) will utilize two promising analytical frameworks- the first is usually called main path (or knowledge trajectory) analysis and the second is called rate of improvement estimation.</p><p>Main path analysis began with Hummon and Doreian&#x02019;s technique for analysis of citation networks of scientific papers and their initial application was to the development of DNA theory from 1820 to 1965 [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. They developed the methodology and demonstrated it by identifying the key papers in this knowledge trajectory. Verspagen [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Mina et al [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] then adapted main path analysis for technological knowledge trajectories by applying the Hummon and Doreian technique to the patent citation network for fuel cells [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and coronary artery disease treatment [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The technique has been extended [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and applied to several other technological domains [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0198541.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0198541.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] including telecommunication switching, solar photovoltaics, desalination and others. A technique for obtaining relevant and relatively complete patent sets for characterizing domains developed by Benson and Magee [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0198541.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] proved useful in main path analysis [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and is the starting point for gathering patents in the present work.</p><p>Empirical study of the change in technological performance with time [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] has shown that the exponential dependence first noted by Gordon Moore [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] applies (with ample noise) to all domains studied. It is also clear that the exponent (or % change per year) varies among technological domains from ~1.5% per year to ~65% per year [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0198541.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Obtaining empirical estimates for any given domain is problematic and at best extremely time consuming but recent work [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] has resulted in reliable estimates based upon representative sets of patents for the domain of interest. Indeed, Triulzi et al [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] have shown that the most reliable estimate of performance improvement rate is based upon analysis of the same patent citation network used to determine knowledge trajectories. Domains that improve more rapidly carry more than their share of the total information flow on the overall patent citation network; that is, their patents have higher average information centrality.</p><p>The extremely high interest in and potential for CRISPR along with the patent analysis methods just mentioned led to the formulation of two research objectives guiding the current research. The first research objective involves determining what the patent record shows about the relationship of CRISPR to prior technology- particularly pre-existing genome engineering technology. The second research objective is to estimate the rate of improvement in performance of genome engineering and CRISPR.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Collection of data</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Genome engineering patent set</title><p>The current research utilizes two sets of US patents for the quantitative empirical study. The first set of patents represent the genome engineering domain and are retrieved using the Classification Overlap Method (COM) [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] which utilizes two different classification systems to obtain highly relevant patents. In this study, the COM procedure was implemented in 5 steps. (step 1) Preparation of Pre-set patents: This step can utilize representative key inventors, assignees, or patents. In the current study, we utilized 58 patents found by searching for some known inventors of genome editing technologies-the titles of the 58 patents, the inventors and assignees for this starting step are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0198541.s001">S1 Table</xref>. (step 2) Identification of classes in two distinct classification systems: we chose the US Patent Classification (UPC), and the Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) as the systems. Mean Precision-Recall [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0198541.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] was used as the metric to identify the relevant classes in UPC and in CPC. (step 3) Patents that are common to classes in UPC and in CPC identified in Step 2 are retrieved; (step 4) Test of relevancy: A sample of retrieved patents (most cited 100 patents and 200 randomly selected patents from the remaining) were read (mostly just titles and abstracts) by the investigators to determine relevancy of the patent set. In the present case, relevancy was specifically assessed by determining if the patents described an invention (ingredient, instrument, and process) that had enabled or was used for editing genes. If it did so, the patent was considered relevant. If the invention was used for manipulating other cellular structures such as ribonuclease or proteins but not genes, the patent was classified as non-relevant. Accordingly, the patent US6607882 was coded as relevant to genome engineering as the invention describes methods for modulating expression of endogenous cellular genes using recombinant zinc finger proteins. In contrast, the patent US5637463 was coded as not relevant to genome engineering as it describes methods to detect protein-protein interactions but had no direct link to genome editing. (step 5) For completeness, the classes were checked to ensure that more than 75% of the 58 key patents were included in the retrieved set of patents.</p><p>To generate the final genome engineering patent set, the steps above were applied to all granted US patents from 1970/01/01 to 2018/01/15 available in Patsnap, a commercial patent database [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The 58 patents for Step 1 as listed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0198541.s001">S1 Table</xref> include 28 patents related to zinc finger nuclease (ZFN), 8 patents for transcription activator-like nucleases (TALEN), 6 patents for meganuclease and 16 patents for CRISPR. An in-depth study of a sample of patents in the genome editing patents showed that significant number of the patents were classified in many classes. For example, patent number US8865406 is classified into 14 UPC classes, which is unlike what is typically seen in other technological domains such as Solar Power, Batteries, and Integrated Circuits (average is 3.2 UPC classes). Further, we also observed that the Mean-Precision Recall value of UPC and CPC classes decayed slowly as compared to other domains. This implied that potentially relevant patents were widely dispersed across many classes both in UPC and in CPC. This made it necessary to include multiple classes both in UPC and in CPC to attain adequate coverage of patents and dictated that reading titles and abstracts was done in multiple iterations.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198541.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows the classes considered to retrieve genome engineering patents, which are decomposed into three components for readability: The first component consists of patents related to ZFN, TALEN, and meganuclease. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198541.g001">Fig 1</xref>, this component uses four classes from UPC and four from CPC. The second and third components consist of patents related to CRISPR, and uses a Ribonuclease class both in UPC and in CPC. We note here that COM utilizes two classification systems to identify patents in a domain, as the co-occurrence in two classes in different systems leads to highly relevant patents [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0198541.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Since mid-2015, the USPTO has stopped classifying US patents using UPC classes. Therefore, we split the period into prior to mid-2015, and after mid-2015, so we may still gain the advantage of COM&#x02019;s effectiveness in yielding highly relevant set of patents for the period before mid-2015. The third component utilizes only the CPC class. Using the classes and the time period considered (1970/1/1-2018/1/15), we retrieved 1373 patents.

The creation of a new CPC patent class by the USPTO during 2017 -specifically to contain CRISPR patents- defined a useful starting point to find current CRISPR patents. As of January 14, 2018, this CPC patent class (C12N2310/20) contained 37 patents (granted between 1976/1/1&#x02013;2018/1/15) which we call Generation 0 (in short Gen0 patents). We then retrieved the 112 granted patents cited by Gen0 patents (generation 1, in short Gen1). These 112 patents are those remaining after those cited that were already in Gen0 were removed, thus making Gen1 mutually exclusive. We then retrieved 1230 patents cited by Gen1 patents, but not belonging to Gen0 or Gen1, as Generation2 (in short, Gen2) patents. It is noted that there was no restriction as to what classes the cited patents in Gen1 and Gen2 belonged. These three subsets, Gen0, Gen1 and Gen2, in total 1379 patents, make up the patent network directly generated by citation cascade from CRISPR patents in 2 generations of citations.

The method originated to understand the evolution of scientific fields through study of citations by scientific publications [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The methodology was adapted and modified to investigate the evolution of knowledge in many technological domains [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

Labeled as genetic backward-forward path (GBFP) analysis, the optimized method consists of four steps shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198541.g004">Fig 4</xref> going from left to right: assembling/collecting a patent set, constructing a citation network within the patent set, measuring knowledge persistence of the patents to identify genetically high-persistent patents (the three sub-processes in this step are described further in the following paragraph), and tracing main paths (forward and backward) from the genetically high-persistent patents.</p><fig id="pone.0198541.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0198541.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Steps for genetic backward-forward path analysis (GBFP) adapted from (17).</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0198541.g004"/></fig><p>To implement the method for the genome engineering and CRISPR roots patent sets, the patent network is constructed using the citations made by the patents in the sets. It is noted that we consider citations only within the patent set; any citations outside the patent set are ignored. To estimate the persistence of knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] contained in each patent, the patent network is first ordered using the citations into <italic>n</italic> layers (visualize that the patents initially cited are on the left and are the start-points) and then knowledge persistence is estimated for each patent in the leftmost layer (layer 1). The process is repeated successively for the subsequent layers moving to the right (layers 2, 3, 4&#x02026;) after eliminating all the layers to the left of the layer in question until one reaches the end-points. This algorithm estimates two types of persistence values (0 to 1 after normalizing) for each patent in the network: global persistence (GP) and local persistence (LP). The GP of a patent is estimated to gauge the importance of a patent in the entire network whereas LP is estimated to gauge the importance of patents in each layer. The layer persistence plays a significant role in identifying and retaining important patents, which are recent, and hence, have not had a chance for their lineage to evolve. The high-persistent (GP &#x0003e; 0.3 and LP &#x0003e; 0.8) patents then become the origin for tracing for the main paths, both backward and forward [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We adopt GBFP analysis to investigate the evolution of CRISPR within the genome engineering domain. The most important reason for use of the technique is to identify a <italic>readable</italic> number of important patents that preceded the CRISPR technology. Each of the main path papers cited gives some evidence that the identified patents are indeed the most important in the domain with two references most clearly doing so [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. By reading these important patents we are also able to identify technology clusters within genome engineering that preceded CRISPR.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Estimation of patent centrality and annual improvement rate (k)</title><p>The estimation of annual improvement rate for a set of patents starts- as does the main path method just described- with the patent citation network. The centrality of a patent is analogous to betweenness centrality in network analysis, and provides a measure of the influence a node, in our case the patent, has over flow of information (in our case, the technological knowledge) through the network. Our calculation of the information centrality can again be traced to Hummon and Doreian [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and their introduction of search path node pairs (SPNP) as a metric to compute the centrality of a focal paper in a scientific paper citation network. The SPNP for a focal patent (say, patent B) in a patent citation network calculates the number of pathways originating from one patent (say, patent A) to another one (patent C) in the network <italic>and</italic> passing through the focal patent (patent B). The higher the number of pathways traversing through the focal patent the higher the centrality of the focal patent, indicating the importance of the focal patent in the patent citation network. Since each patent can be interpreted as containing some original technological knowledge, the centrality provides a sense of the importance of the original knowledge introduced by the focal patent for the downstream patents. Triulzi et al [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] normalized the SPNP to account for the variations inherent in the patenting system (for example, citation practices between fields, and particularly over time), which make raw centrality values of patents across domains and between two different time periods non-comparable. To control for these variations, the computed centrality of a patent is compared with the expected value of the centrality of the same patent in appropriately randomized models of the citation network [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The centrality calculated was for the citation network of all US utility patents granted from 1976 until 2015. Triulzi et al further find that the mean normalized centrality of a patent set representing a specific technological domain is a reliable predictor of its annual rate of improvement (k). They arrive at this conclusion by a Monte Carlo cross-validation exercise between empirically observed k for the 30 diverse technological domains [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0198541.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and their corresponding mean normalized centrality of the patent sets for the same 30 technological domains.

This invention led to the possibility that the nuclease activity of FokI could be fused to alternative DNA binding domains to create so called &#x0201c;hybrid REs&#x0201d; with novel, and potentially rare DNA target sequences useful for genome engineering in large animal and plant genomes [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>A significant challenge in producing hybrid REs in bacteria was that they were potentially lethal to their host bacteria if the latter contained target sequences in their genome [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].

ZFN pairs provided greater DNA target specificity because they require correct binding of two separate zinc fingers to reconstitute the nuclease activity of the FokI dimer [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>In the past decade, patents 18, 19 and 20 describe the application of ZFN and TALEN genome engineering technologies for specific therapeutic purposes, such as to modulate PD1 gene expression for cancer immunotherapy (patent 18) or severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) related genes (patents 19 and 20). Patents 24, 25, 27 and 28 from Factor Bioscience all describe extending the therapeutic application of ZFN, TALENs or CRISPR by therapeutic delivery of a synthetic RNA encoding the genome editing enzymes rather than DNA. In this way, the therapeutic nucleic acid is not incorporated into the genome potentially reducing the risk of unwarranted mutagenesis and limiting the therapeutic exposure to the lifespan of the RNA molecule.</p><p>The 20 patents just discussed and particularly the 12 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198541.g006">Fig 6</xref>) that the technique identified as high persistence patents are clearly important patents as identified by other observers. The main path technique indicates that they are the most important in the overall development of genome editing prior to CRISPR. Therefore, we regard this small set of patents as the core technology preceding the CRISPR breakthrough but we do not regard all the rest of the 1373 patents in the set as unimportant since it is highly likely there are other quite important patents in the set.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>CRISPR roots patents</title><p>The CRISPR roots patent set is different from the genome engineering patent set as it does not focus on a specific technical area (genome engineering) but instead backwardly traces <italic>all</italic> patented knowledge sources that have contributed to the emergence of CRISPR technology.

Additionally, all citations outside this selected set were ignored for the genome engineering main path analysis whereas the CRISPR roots includes <italic>all</italic> citations from the initial set of patents.

Since this patent set is obtained starting with the citations by the currently published CRISPR patents, this knowledge network is constrained to end on the right at the CRISPR patents and the main path identifies patents that were particularly important in citations cascading back from these patents. The reasoning to develop this non-usual main path was simply to reduce the 1300+ patent set to the 50 most important ones so that it was possible to read and sort the patents.</p><fig id="pone.0198541.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0198541.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Main path for the CRISPR roots showing patents on this knowledge trajectory from the CRISPR patents (gen 0), the patents cited by the CRISPR patents (gen 1) and the patents cited by gen 1 patents but not by CRISPR patents (gen 2).</title><p>Three main paths (CR1, CR2, and CR3) have been identified.

The presence of CR1 and CR3 paths in the roots main path demonstrates the broader scope of the CRISPR roots compared with the genome editing patent set. The patents in these paths were not in the genome engineering set by design but are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198541.g007">Fig 7</xref> to play a prominent &#x0201c;spillover&#x0201d; role in the emergence of CRISPR.</p><p><xref rid="pone.0198541.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the ten patents with the highest normalized centrality (maximum = 1) from the CRISPR roots.

Thus, the x3 difference in the estimated k values is probably not only due to uncertain estimates. Since these two sets of patents have large differences in what is included, significant differences in k are not unreasonable and could arise in various ways. One factor that appears likely to explain a large part of the differential result is the significantly larger breadth of the patents in the CRISPR roots which was discussed in the preceding section as reflecting the &#x0201c;spillover&#x0201d; patents in the roots that are not in the genome editing patent set. Such patents were not included in the domains where the empirical correlation was established [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and would tend to distort k estimates for domains upwardly since patents cited from &#x0201c;farther afield&#x0201d; tend to be patents that are important in carrying information-that is have important new knowledge at their core- and thus have higher centrality than average. Since the genome engineering patent set has considerably lower average centrality (0.27) than the entire US patent set (0.5), including such patents in the set (as the roots set does) raises the overall k estimate. For example, the patents in <xref rid="pone.0198541.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> are the highest centrality patents from the roots set and were already seen as demonstrating breadth in the roots patent set.</p><p>Our second finding is that even the k value for the roots set is not very high in terms of what we now know about k values in various domains. Indeed, the average centrality of the genome engineering set is well below average (0.27) for USPTO patents and the average centrality of the CRISPR roots is higher (.43) but still below average for the entire US patent set which is equal to 0.5 [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Discussion and conclusions</title><p>Our first research objective was to determine what the patent record suggests relative to the relationship of CRISPR to prior technology- particularly pre-existing genome engineering.

The technologies playing an important and possibly essential role in CRISPR emergence include knowledge about PCR, knowledge from the osmotic device domain, from the ultrasound apparatus domain, from the crystal protein technology domain, and the drug delivery domain among many others. Such breadth is not unexpected from the prior knowledge of spillover but the specifics of the breadth is not usually determined. We note that qualitative histories tend to focus on the most direct technological path (or just the science) and thus do not begin to point to the technological breadth that may be essential to the emergence of highly novel and important technologies like CRISPR.</p><p>The results obtained in pursuit of our second objective (estimation of the rate of improvement for CRISPR) go well beyond anything done elsewhere. The estimate of the rate of technological performance improvement for CRISPR has been reported here and is the only estimate for <italic>any</italic> emerging technological domain to our knowledge. Since it is a first estimate of its kind, we must be careful to not over-claim significance and thus the following discussion should be considered preliminary until further patents emerge over time in the CRISPR domain and more importantly until other newly emerging technologies are studied by the techniques pioneered here. Although there has been some work on some emerging (but poorly defined) domains such as nanotechnology, this has not used the methods (main paths, roots investigation, rate estimation) applied herein to CRISPR. Most importantly, such domains typically have patents dating from many years back whereas the first CRISPR patent was in 2012. Studies of other emerging domains that we envision would concentrate on the initial 5&#x02013;10 years after the initial patent.</p><p>Regarding the relatively low rate of performance improvement estimated for CRISPR, there are two topics worthy of such an early discussion. One is the potential importance of this observation to the evolving CRISPR story and another one is possible specific kind of performance improvement that is being estimated. As an initial remark on the significance of the observation in the evolving CRISPR story we do not believe low performance improvement rates mean that CRISPR is less important than it has been declared to be [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, we find it probable that the performance improvement being estimated is important rather than something to be ignored. One speculation is that the rate of improvement may relate to an unimportant metric; however, logical analysis of known results make this appear unlikely. It is unlikely first because it is usual [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] that <italic>most intensive improvement rates in a domain are the same</italic> within the normal variation so important and less important metrics tend to improve at the same rate. Moreover, some logical metrics for such a domain are clearly important; for example, a metric such as the increase in benefit (for example quality life years in a case like CRISPR) divided by the constraint (for example cost) is a likely relevant intensive metric that is improving at 3.5% (or possibly 9%) per year. To improve such a metric as Qualy/$ for CRISPR therapies from a very low starting point today will take solving multiple problems of harmful side effects while improving the ease with which genome engineering can be applied to a variety of human diseases. Thus (remembering our caveat about conclusions being preliminary), it is likely that important CRISPR based therapies will be appearing over many decades&#x02013;not just in the next few years and that important developments in genome engineering will continue to build on and beyond CRISPR.</p><p>Our last conclusion from the research reported here is that the techniques used in the paper (main paths, comparing roots and the specific technological domain, k estimation) allow one to further understand specific technological developments very early after their emergence. However, we would like to stress that such objective methods are not a replacement for deep qualitative studies such as those by Lander, Doudna/Sternberg and Urnov [<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198541.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] but instead are a valuable supplement. The supplement in this case is the clear <italic>technological</italic> breadth of CRISPR, the core gene editing patents linked to CRISPR, and the indication&#x02013;even though preliminary- of relatively slow performance improvement of CRISPR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec012"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0198541.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>List of 58 patents used as a preset to find relevant UPC and CPC patent classes for genome engineering.</title><p>Included are the patent number, title, publication year, inventors and assignees for each patent.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0198541.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge research support from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany and the help of Erik Vogan of MIT&#x02019;s Industrial Liaison Office in initiating this research effort.
