Typically, such measurements rely on PCR followed by next-generation sequencing. However, PCR amplification can introduce significant quantitative error. We describe REcount, a novel PCR-free direct counting method. Comparing measurements of defined plasmid pools to droplet digital PCR data demonstrates that REcount is highly accurate and reproducible. We use REcount to provide new insights into clustering biases due to molecule length across different Illumina sequencers and illustrate the impacts on interpretation of next-generation sequencing data and the economics of data generation.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s13059-019-1691-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Next-generation sequencing</kwd><kwd>DNA library preparation</kwd><kwd>PCR-free</kwd><kwd>Illumina</kwd><kwd>Size bias</kwd><kwd>RNA-Seq</kwd><kwd>RAD-Seq</kwd><kwd>Genotyping by sequencing</kwd><kwd>ATAC-Seq</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000009</institution-id><institution>Foundation for the National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1TR000114</award-id><award-id>S10 OD018174</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beckman</surname><given-names>Kenneth B.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par2">Engineered constructs underlie many experimental techniques in genetics and genomics. For example, targeted perturbation of gene function using RNA interference or CRISPR/Cas9 allows for pooled genome-wide genetic screens that can be read-out through next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the small hairpin RNA (shRNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] or synthetic guide RNA (sgRNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] constructs, or associated sequence tags/barcodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Transposable elements are also commonly used to mutate or otherwise manipulate genetic loci, and similarly enable genome-scale saturation mutagenesis screens in which the transposon-genome junction is measured using NGS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Lineage tracing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and connectomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] approaches also rely on NGS-based quantification of molecular tags. In all of these approaches, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification is used to enrich for the sequence tags and to add adapters and other functionalities (e.g., sample-specific barcodes) required for sequencing. However, PCR introduces bias into these measurements. Sequence tags comprised of shRNAs, sgRNAs, transposon-genome junctions, or synthetic barcodes can all differ in primary sequence and biophysical properties, which, along with other variables such as template concentration and PCR conditions, can influence amplification efficiency in unpredictable ways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Adding unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) can mitigate some of this bias, but increases the complexity of both library preparation and analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Other approaches such as droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and NanoString analysis can be used to overcome the quantitative inaccuracies associated with measuring engineered genetic constructs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The NanoString nCounter instrument uses hybridization of fluorescently barcoded probes to count copies of target molecules in a sample. ddPCR achieves high accuracy by partitioning individual molecules into emulsion droplets and counting the number of droplets with and without amplification, thereby digitizing PCR and removing amplification bias from the quantification process. However, ddPCR and NanoString analysis, while highly accurate, lack the throughput and resolution afforded by NGS.</p><p id="Par3">We have developed a novel method, REcount (<italic>R</italic>estriction <italic>E</italic>nzyme enabled <italic>count</italic>ing) for quantifying sequence tags associated with engineered constructs that is straightforward to implement and allows for direct NGS-based counting of a potentially enormous number of sequence tags. In this approach, an Illumina adapter-flanked DNA barcode is liberated by digesting with <italic>Mly</italic>I (a type IIS restriction enzyme that produces blunt-ended molecules) and sequenced to directly count template molecule abundance (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). We demonstrate that REcount measurements are amenable to multiplexing through the use of five orthogonal restriction enzymes, an approach that likely is further generalizable to other enzymes.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>REcount enables accurate and precise measurements of plasmid pools. <bold>a</bold> Design of REcount constructs.

Specifically, molecules in DNA sequencing libraries are systematically and often substantially over- or under-represented on different Illumina sequencer models in a manner related to molecule length. Finally, we assess the impact of size bias across several common applications of NGS, including transcriptomic measurements (RNA-Seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]), reduced-representation genotyping (RAD-Seq/GBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]), and accessible chromatin profiling (ATAC-Seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Development and assessment of the REcount method</title><p id="Par5">In order to characterize the REcount method, we constructed a pool of 20 synthetic plasmids containing REcount barcodes, mixed at an equimolar abundance (5% per plasmid) based on fluorometric DNA concentration measurements. This pool was digested with <italic>Mly</italic>I and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. All 20 barcodes were detected at relative abundances ranging from 3.41 to 6.32% (CV&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.13), consistent with the targeted abundances of 5% per construct (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). To generate a more accurately pooled reference standard for subsequent experiments, we used this sequencing data as the basis for re-pooling the 20 plasmids and digested the new pool with <italic>Mly</italic>I and sequenced. The range of relative abundances of the re-pooled plasmids was narrower, ranging from 4.52 to 5.58% (CV&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.06), indicating that the initial sequencing data was predictive in improving the accuracy of pooling as assessed by REcount (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). To assess the reproducibility of these measurements, we digested and sequenced two additional replicates of the even plasmid pool. The replicate REcount measurements were highly reproducible with an average CV of 0.02 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b).</p><p id="Par6">Next, we compared REcount measurements of the even plasmid pool to PCR-based measurements, either of the barcode construct (BC) or another construct-specific sequence (V4). We tested amplification using 10, 20, 30, or 40 PCR cycles. While 40&#x02009;cycles of PCR is more than would typically&#x000a0;be used for NGS library preparation, we chose these conditions to bracket the range of low and high PCR cycle numbers. PCR-based measurements exhibited substantial construct-specific deviations from the expected 5% values, the extent of which increased with greater numbers of PCR cycles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, d). Furthermore, the construct-specific deviations from expected values were uncorrelated for the BC and V4 amplicon measurements, suggesting that the PCR biases were a function of template sequence (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2).</p><p id="Par7">ddPCR is a highly accurate method for measuring the copy number of molecules in a sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In order to independently measure the relative template concentrations in the even plasmid pool, we designed a pair of ddPCR assays targeting each barcode construct and validated the specificity of each assay using qPCR on each of the 20 individual plasmid templates (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The ddPCR-based measurements correlated well with the REcount measurements, both for the original and re-pooled even plasmid pools (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3). In contrast, the PCR-based measurements of both the BC and V4 amplicons were not well-correlated with the ddPCR measurements (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e, Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3). These results were corroborated with similar measurements of a pool of the same 20 plasmids mixed in a staggered manner, where PCR-based measurements had reduced correlation with ddPCR measurements and led to a systematic overestimation of the lower abundance constructs (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4). Taken together, these results indicate that REcount accurately reports on template abundance, while PCR-based measurements introduce increasing error with increased cycle numbers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Multiplexing REcount measurements through the use of orthogonal restriction enzymes</title><p id="Par8">One drawback of the REcount method is that the indices that specify sample identity in multiplexed sequencing, which are typically flexibly added by PCR, are hard-coded into the constructs. To overcome this limitation, we tested whether orthogonal restriction enzymes could be used to multiplex REcount measurements. We initially chose <italic>Mly</italic>I as the flanking enzyme because it could precisely liberate the desired Illumina adapter-flanked construct. We tested whether other restriction enzymes that do not cleanly liberate flush Illumina adapter ends could also be used for REcount measurements. Initially, we tested <italic>Bsm</italic>I, <italic>Bts</italic><sup>&#x003b1;</sup>I, and <italic>Bsr</italic>DI, each of which leaves 2-nt 3&#x02032; overhangs. We constructed a pool of 12 plasmids comprised of sets of three barcoded constructs flanked by either <italic>Mly</italic>I, <italic>Bsm</italic>I, <italic>Bts</italic><sup>&#x003b1;</sup>I, or <italic>Bsr</italic>DI (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). In addition, all 12 of these constructs contained a pair of <italic>Sbf</italic>I sites located such that digestion with <italic>Sbf</italic>I liberates all 12 Illumina adapter-flanked cassettes with additional overhangs of between 30 and 36&#x02009;bp upstream of the p5 flowcell adapter and between 40 and 50&#x02009;bp downstream of the p7 flowcell adapter. We digested this plasmid pool with each of the five enzymes individually and individually sequenced the digests and mapped the reads to a reference file containing all 12 expected barcodes. For <italic>Mly</italic>I, <italic>Bsm</italic>I, <italic>Bts</italic><sup>&#x003b1;</sup>I, and <italic>Bsr</italic>DI, the expected barcodes were detected for each respective enzyme (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b&#x02013;e, g&#x02013;j). All 12 barcodes were detected when the pool was digested with <italic>Sbf</italic>I, indicating that clustering and sequencing can occur even in the presence of large (30&#x02013;50&#x02009;bp) overhangs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f, k). We were not able to determine whether the length of the overhang affects the efficiency of clustering as each of these samples was sequenced in a portion of a MiSeq lane, together with other libraries. We observed differing amounts of off-target barcode detection in these orthogonal digests, ranging from &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.2% in the <italic>Bsm</italic>I digest to approximately 6% in the <italic>Bts</italic><sup>&#x003b1;</sup>I digest (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b&#x02013;e, g&#x02013;j).

Thus, we used REcount to characterize the size bias profiles of the Illumina iSeq, MiSeq, HiSeq 2500, HiSeq 4000, NextSeq, and NovaSeq sequencers. We synthesized 30 constructs, each of which contained an <italic>Mly</italic>I-flanked normalization barcode of consistent length (164&#x02009;bp), and a barcode-containing variable-length insert ranging from 22 to 1372&#x02009;bp, resulting in adapter-flanked molecules between 150 and 1500&#x02009;bp (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5).

Representative data from a single MiSeq run is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b. Since each normalization barcode is present at an equimolar ratio to the corresponding size standard (as they are on the same plasmid), this allows any inaccuracies in plasmid pooling to be accounted for. Within a sequencing platform, clustering size bias exhibits run-to-run variation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S6).

For the NextSeq and NovaSeq, the extent of the size bias between platforms ranged between three and five-fold for small or moderately sized molecules (150&#x02013;600&#x02009;bp) to up to more than 100-fold for molecules over 1&#x02009;kb.</p><p id="Par11">Differences were also seen between the HiSeq 2500 in Rapid Run (onboard clustering) and High Output (cBot clustering) modes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5). In addition, we observed an effect of molecule length on sequencing quality score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], with a general trend towards longer molecules having lower quality scores (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5). The magnitude of the effect of molecule length on sequence quality varied among the different instruments.</p><p id="Par12">The denaturation process can also affect the size bias observed on Illumina instruments. Denatured libraries are sometimes saved for re-sequencing in the case of a run failure (although Illumina&#x02019;s best practices recommend preparing freshly denatured libraries). To test whether freshly denatured libraries perform differently from frozen&#x000a0;previously denatured libraries, we sequenced a freshly denatured library on a MiSeq, and the same denatured library 1&#x000a0;day later, after a freeze-thaw cycle, on a second MiSeq. The freeze-thaw cycle had a substantial effect on the size bias profile of this library; in particular, there was a dramatic reduction in the fraction of 150-bp molecules observed, resulting in a corresponding upward shift of the curve (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e). It is likely that this shift reflects differential re-annealing of 150-bp fragments (which are in molar excess due to the presence of the large number of similarly sized normalization barcodes), or other small library molecules in the sequencing pool. This observation suggests that some of the difference in clustering size bias observed between the different platforms may be due to differences in denaturation conditions, the amount of time between loading the library and clustering, and whether the clustering process takes place in a chilled compartment (such as on the MiSeq) or not (such as the HiSeq&#x000a0;2500 and NextSeq). Consistent with this idea, the variation between HiSeq&#x000a0;2500 and HiSeq 4000 flow cells is much larger than the variation between the lanes on the same flow cell (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S6).</p><p id="Par13">It is also likely that a portion of the variability between flow cells is due to differences in the size distributions of the libraries being sequenced together with the synthetic size standards, as competition for clustering will occur between all molecules in the sequencing lane. We observed a shift in the curve corresponding to a decreased representation of the larger size standards when they were sequenced together with a library containing a significant amount of material that was smaller than 300&#x02009;bp on the HiSeq 4000 (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S6). Although the size standards were sequenced together with different libraries across the different instruments, this context-dependent clustering is not sufficient to explain the large differences we see between different instruments. For example, libraries with similar average sizes and distributions yielded dramatically different measurements of size bias on the NextSeq versus the HiSeq 4000 (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S6).</p><p id="Par14">Surprisingly, we also detected an instance of construct-specific size bias, specifically on the HiSeq 2500 platform in Rapid Run mode (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S6). In contrast to the iSeq, MiSeq, HiSeq 2500 High Output, HiSeq&#x000a0;4000, NextSeq, and NovaSeq where no systematic construct-specific biases were observed, the size bias curves for the 16S, GAPDH, and alpha-Tubulin constructs separated as size increased, with 16S showing much less of a drop-off with increased molecule size. One possible explanation for this difference is that the 16S rRNA gene has a substantial secondary structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], which may serve to shorten the effective length of the molecule during the clustering process. This phenomenon may be due to differences in the clustering process or temperature on this platform, which may be less effective at dissociating the secondary structure of the 16S rRNA gene (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://support.illumina.com/bulletins/2016/10/considerations-when-migrating-nonillumina-libraries-between-sequencing-platforms.html">https://support.illumina.com/bulletins/2016/10/considerations-when-migrating-nonillumina-libraries-between-sequencing-platforms.html</ext-link>). The HiSeq and MiSeq also have different recommended NaOH concentrations for denaturing libraries. It is possible that long molecules, particularly those with highly stable secondary structure, are incompletely denatured under the HiSeq denaturing conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Characterizing the effects of size bias on data generation across different Illumina sequencers</title><p id="Par15">In order to determine the effects of size bias on the interpretation of NGS results, we sequenced a number of different types of libraries across multiple Illumina sequencers. First, we examined an RNA-Seq library. Since RNA-Seq library preparation involves random shearing of cDNA molecules, we did not expect to see an effect of size bias on the gene expression counts. In addition, the range of fragment sizes in this library was relatively tight, resulting in only minor differences in the observed insert sizes between the NextSeq and NovaSeq platforms (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Consistent with expectations, the gene expression measurements for the RNA-Seq library were highly correlated between the NextSeq and the NovaSeq (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Instrument-specific size biases have minimal effect on RNA-sequencing data. <bold>a</bold> Fragment size distributions for an RNA-Seq library sequenced on the NovaSeq and the NextSeq. <bold>b</bold> Correlation of expression values (FPKM) for this library across the two instruments</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13059_2019_1691_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par16">Next, we examined the effects of cross-platform size biases on two different types of libraries (RAD-Seq and ATAC-Seq) that were made using techniques which do not involve random shearing, and for which the size&#x000a0;of fragments represented in the sequencing library are related to the underlying biology being measured. RAD-Seq (also commonly referred to as genotyping by sequencing (GBS) or sequencing-based genotyping (SBG)), is a reduced-representation genotyping method in which adapters are ligated to restriction fragments which are then sequenced to identify sequence polymorphisms in a reproducible subset of genomic loci. We made RAD-Seq libraries from 11 strains of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and sequenced these libraries on both the HiSeq&#x000a0;2500 and the NextSeq. In contrast to the RNA-Seq library, these RAD-Seq libraries had a much wider size distribution (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S7). As observed with the REcount size standards, the size distribution of molecules sequenced on the HiSeq&#x000a0;2500 skewed larger than that on the NextSeq (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). This resulted in a larger number of markers and loci detected on the HiSeq compared to the NextSeq when using identical read depths and filtering parameters (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b, c). When these data were processed together, the differences in the size distribution also resulted in an elevated rate of missing genotype calls for the NextSeq samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d) and a sequencer-dependent shift in the PCA plot (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e). This shift was in general smaller than the differences between different genetic backgrounds and could be eliminated by filtering the VCF file to remove variants that were genotyped in less than 95% of the samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>f). Thus, in the case of RAD-Seq, size bias introduces a measurable, but correctable, bias.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Instrument size biases affect genotyping marker observations in RAD-Seq data. <bold>a</bold> Average read counts for 11 RAD-Seq samples sequenced on the HiSeq or NextSeq. <bold>b</bold> Number of markers observed in filtered VCF file for the 11 RAD-Seq libraries. <bold>c</bold> Number of loci observed in filtered VCF file for the 11 RAD-Seq libraries. <bold>d</bold> Fraction of missing genotype calls for each sample in the unfiltered VCF file. <bold>e</bold> PCA plot generated using the unfiltered VCF file. <bold>f</bold> PCA plot using the filtered VCF file.

Since the samples sequenced on the HiSeq had a wider distribution of fragment sizes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a), this resulted in more markers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b), but a lower average coverage (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S8). Thus, the sharper attenuation of clustering based on fragment size observed on the NextSeq can lead to more uniform coverage of a set of markers, and could potentially allow for higher levels of multiplexing. However, it should be noted that size selection could also achieve a similar effect with RAD-Seq libraries.</p><p id="Par18">ATAC-Seq represents another commonly used library preparation method where a wide range of DNA fragment sizes are sequenced. In this technique, library insert size is also intimately linked to the underlying biology, as the fragment sizes represent the chromatin state of the corresponding DNA. In cases such as this, size selection cannot be used to harmonize fragment sizes between different libraries, as size selecting could introduce bias into the resulting data by skewing the proportions of nucleosomal and non-nucleosomal reads. We sequenced six ATAC-Seq libraries representing three replicates each of mouse ES-derived mesodermal precursor cells (PDGFR&#x003b1;+FLK1&#x02212; sorted cells) expressing or not expressing the PAX3 transcription factor on both the HiSeq&#x000a0;2500 and the NextSeq. As with the REcount size standards, larger-sized fragments were more highly represented on the HiSeq&#x000a0;2500 than on the NextSeq (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S9). This resulted in a significant difference in the proportion of non-nucleosomal, di-nucleosomal, and tri-nucleosomal reads between the two sequencers, while the proportion of mono-nucleosomal reads was unaffected (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). It should be noted that for ATAC-Seq, reduced clustering efficiency for larger-sized fragments as well as PCR amplification bias during library preparation both likely serve to skew the representation of nucleosome-associated reads.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Effect of instrument size bias on ATAC-Seq data. <bold>a</bold> Average insert size for 6 ATAC-Seq libraries sequenced on the HiSeq or NextSeq. <bold>b</bold> Percentage of reads at a subsampled depth of 20 million reads per sample classified as non-, mono-, di-, and tri-nucleosomal. <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6 libraries. ***denotes <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01 using a t-test. n.s. denotes no significant difference. <bold>c</bold> Distribution of mapped reads at the <italic>Fgfr4</italic> locus.

Sequencing reads were mapped to the mouse genome, subsampled to a depth of 20 million reads per sample, and peaks that were enriched in PAX3-expressing cells were called using MACS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] either for all reads or for the non-nucleosomal reads (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S10). In both cases, at the <italic>Fgfr4</italic> locus, PAX3-dependent enhancer peaks were more prominent when the samples were sequenced on the NextSeq. This difference was likely due to the over-representation of smaller (non-nucleosomal) fragments on the NextSeq relative to the HiSeq&#x000a0;2500, which correspond to transcription factor binding sites. Using a consistent read depth and parameters, this cross-platform difference resulted in PAX3-responsive peaks being called with MACS for the NextSeq samples and not the HiSeq samples.</p><p id="Par20">Thus, sequencer-specific size bias can influence biologically relevant conclusions in some instances. It is possible in this case that increased read depth on the HiSeq&#x000a0;2500 or alterations of the MACS peak-calling parameters could resolve this difference. Nonetheless, in cases such as ATAC-Seq, where biologically meaningful information is encoded in the size structure of the sequencing library, care should be taken to account for and minimize the effects of sequencer-specific size bias in data generation (for instance, by carrying out all experiments on the same sequencing platform, and by choosing an instrument with a desirable size bias profile).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par21">In summary, we describe REcount, a novel method for obtaining highly accurate and precise PCR-free NGS-based measurements of engineered constructs. In future studies, similar constructs could be incorporated into shRNA, CRISPR, and transposon libraries to improve quantification of these molecules in pooled genetic screens. Currently, such measurements are prone to bias introduced by PCR, as we observed for both the BC and V4 amplicons (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4), as well as other PCR artifacts such as PCR chimeras which can cause barcode-construct mis-associations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Sequence-specific amplification biases are often mitigated by including input controls, which are thought to accurately model amplification biases. However, amplification biases can be impacted by template concentration and by the context of the other molecules in the amplification reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and can limit the sensitivity of these assays by compressing the dynamic range (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4). One challenge of employing REcount in these contexts is the large amount of genomic DNA relative to the PCR-free barcode construct. However, we have successfully quantified&#x000a0;transposon pools from isolated <italic>E. coli</italic> genomic DNA using this approach (data not shown).</p><p id="Par22">We further demonstrated that multiplexing of REcount measurements is possible using orthogonal restriction enzymes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The fact that multiple restriction enzymes can be used to liberate REcount constructs, including <italic>Sbf</italic>I which leaves 30&#x02013;50-bp overhangs on the Illumina adapters, strongly suggests that many other restriction enzymes could be employed for making multiplexed REcount measurements. Thus, REcount allows for potential multiplexing strategies involving orthogonal digestion of distinct subpopulations of molecules or of concatemerized barcode arrays. It is also possible that substituting recombinases for restriction enzymes could lead to more flexible barcoding strategies.</p><p id="Par23">We used REcount to measure size bias on several different Illumina sequencers. We found that size bias can vary between runs and instruments and that the denaturation procedure can affect size bias (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Due to the competitive clustering of molecules of different sizes, it is likely that a portion of the variability between runs and lanes is due to differences in the size distributions of the libraries being sequenced together with the synthetic size standards. Such context-specific effects may be more prominent on patterned flow cell instruments, where library molecules compete for a defined number of clustering sites. Thus, the shape of the size bias curve is likely sensitive to both the size distribution of the libraries being sequenced along with the size standards, as well as the proportion of the lane devoted to the size standards.</p><p id="Par24">As expected, we did not see effects of sequencer-specific size biases on randomly sheared RNA-Seq libraries (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In instances where library fragment sizes were generated in a non-random manner (RAD-Seq and ATAC-Seq libraries), we did see differences in the data generated on instruments with different size bias profiles. In the case of the RAD-Seq libraries, the instrument-specific signal could be removed by filtering out markers which did not appear in both sets of samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). However, the choice of instrument influenced the evenness of marker coverage and thus can affect the economics of sequencing. In the case of ATAC-Seq, differences in size bias between the HiSeq&#x000a0;2500 and the NextSeq led to differences in the proportions of nucleosomal and non-nucleosomal reads and differences in peak calling for a known PAX3-responsive enhancer element (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).</p><p id="Par25">In sum, these results indicate that care should be taken when interpreting quantitative measurements or comparing data across different platforms. This is particularly true in cases where library size distributions are non-random such as in several chromatin profiling methods (e.g., ATAC-Seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], FAIRE-Seq/MAINE-Seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]), approaches that use restriction digestion to fragment DNA (e.g., RAD-Seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]), amplicons that vary in length (e.g., fungal ITS sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]), or techniques such as TAIL-Seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] that explicitly seek to measure molecule length. In addition, because the fragmentation pattern of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is dependent on the chromatin state of the tissue of origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], it is also possible that sequencer size bias could influence the measurement of mutant allele fractions in cfDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Constructs such as those described here could be routinely spiked into Illumina sequencing runs to monitor size bias, similar to the use of PhiX to report on sequencing error rates and other base-calling metrics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par26">We demonstrated that REcount-based measurements of defined plasmid pools are more accurate than PCR-based measurements, that replicate measurements have high precision, and that the technique is amenable to multiplexing through the use of orthogonal restriction enzymes.

We identified sample denaturation as a factor that can influence size bias. We showed that while a randomly sheared RNA-Seq library does not exhibit sequencer-specific quantitative bias in gene expression counts, sequencer size bias can influence both the interpretation of results and the economics of sequencing in cases where library fragment distributions are non-random, such as in RAD-Seq and ATAC-Seq. The quantitative measurements of size bias that we present and the synthetic standards we have developed provide tools for monitoring and accounting for size bias in Illumina sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Synthesis and cloning of REcount plasmids</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Even and staggered pool plasmids</title><p id="Par27">The plasmids comprising the even and staggered pools were designed to include a portion of the 16S rRNA gene from 1 of 20 different bacterial species, modeled on the Human Microbiome Project mock microbial communities (HM-276D and HM-277D, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]), with a 3-bp &#x0201c;TCT&#x0201d; sequence tag added at an analogous position in each construct.

For the analysis of quality scores (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5), the data for all runs on a given platform was concatenated into a single fastq file, then split into individual fastq files for each individual construct, based on the 20-bp sequence barcodes in each construct. Next, the reads were trimmed to 50&#x02009;bp using cutadapt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], so that all constructs and sequencing runs could be compared in a standardized manner. Mean quality scores were calculated for each construct that was represented by at least 100 reads in the data set. This analysis was carried out using a custom Python script (Supplemental File: REcount_split_fastq_Q-score_plots.py), which is available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/darylgohl/REcount/tree/master/Q-score_Analysis">https://github.com/darylgohl/REcount/tree/master/Q-score_Analysis</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>RNA-Seq data analysis</title><p id="Par51">Data quality was assessed using FastQC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>).
