To understand the role of CD133 expression in colon cancer, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of CD133 in colon cancer cells. In this study, we generated CD133<sup>knockout</sup> colon cancer cells (LoVo) using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system. CD133<sup>+</sup> colon cancer cells (LoVo) were infected with the lentiviral vector carrying CD133 gRNA and purified cell by culturing single cell colonies. CD133<sup>knockout</sup> cells was validated by western blot and flow cytometry analysis. In functional study, we observed a significant reduction in cell proliferation and colony formation in CRISPR-Cas9 mediated CD133 <sup>knockout</sup> cells in compare with control (P &#x0003c; 0.001). We also found the anticancer effect of stattic was dependent on CD133 expression in colon cancer cells. Although CD133<sup>knockout</sup> cells could not completely block the tumorigenic property, they showed remarkable inhibitory effects on the ability of cell migration and invasion (P &#x0003c; 0.001). In addition, we examined the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related protein expression by western blot. The result clearly showed a loss of vimentin expression in CD133<sup>knockout</sup> cells. Therefore, CRISPR-Cas9 mediated CD133<sup>knockout</sup> can be an effective treatment modality for CD133<sup>+</sup> colon cancer through reducing the characteristics of cancer stem cells.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, No.2016R1D1A1A09918958 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nrf.re.kr/index">https://www.nrf.re.kr/index</ext-link>).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and available from Dryad using doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8rm2dn0">10.5061/dryad.8rm2dn0</ext-link>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and available from Dryad using doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8rm2dn0">10.5061/dryad.8rm2dn0</ext-link>.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered to be small subsets of tumor cells which exhibit stem-cell-like characteristics and are closely related to self-renewal, tumorigenesis, multi-directional differentiation potential, metastasis initiation, and therapeutic resistance [<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Identification of different subgroups of CSCs by using the expression of cell surface antigens (surface markers) is the most convincing method today [<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Furthermore, these cancer stem cell markers play an important role in biological functions [<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. CD133, a putative CSC marker, has been receiving much attention as a candidate for target therapy [<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220860.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. CD133 expression was reported to be related with poor prognosis, metastasis, and recurrence in colon cancer [<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, controversial results have been reported that both CD133<sup>+</sup> and CD133<sup>-</sup> cells could initiate colon cancer [<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In our previous study, we found that inhibition of cell proliferation after CD133 siRNA transfection was closely related to decreased survivin expression [<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220860.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recently, we found activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is upregulated by interleukin (IL)-6 and blocking of the STAT3/CD133/survivin signaling pathway showed anticancer effect in colon cancer <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220860.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the mechanism involved in CD133 deficiency and changes in invasive ability in cancer cells was not described. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as a misactivation of the embryonic dedifferentitation program, is a critical process in malignant progression [<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Epithelial cells lose polarity, resulting in decreased adhesion and enhanced migration or invasion [<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Turano <italic>et al</italic>. reported atypical nuclear localization of CD133 in a majority of colon cancer cells with more mesenchymal phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated nuclease 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) provides a new genome editing tool that precisely manipulates specific genomic loci and helps elucidate target gene function or disease [<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. CRISPR-Cas9 system can edit a specific gene through cutting double-strand DNA, and host cell responds to this double stand breaks by non-homologues end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) [<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing has been used in many cell lines and organisms and is an effective translational tool for gene editing studies [<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To identify the essential cancer cell genes, a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout library of the guide sequence has been established [<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, CRISPR-Cas9 system has been a powerful and efficient gene editing tool in biomedical research.</p><p>In this study, to determine the role of CD133 in colon cancer, we established a CD133<sup>knockout</sup> colon cancer cell line using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system and analyzed whether CD133 knockout contributed to attenuate the abilities of colon cancer cells, including colony formation, cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Material and method</title><sec id="sec003"><title>I.

CRISPR-Cas9 system guided gene targeting is highly specific and stable. In our previous report, we found CD133 was required for cell proliferation and biological behaviors of colon cancer cell via down-regulating CD133 expression by siRNA transfection [<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220860.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but there was a limitation due to the transient inhibitory effect of siRNA. Moreover, knockdown using siRNA could not completely turn off the target genes, and the interventions of cells with residual gene function cannot be excluded. The potential side effects caused by ectopic RNA or transfection reagents could be effect on the experimental result. In this study, we generated a CD133<sup>knockout</sup> colon cancer cell line by using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system.</p><p>As expected, experimental results of CD133<sup>knockout</sup> cells by CRISPR-Cas9 were similar to the results of our previous experiments with CD133-siRNA. We could get more consistent and convincing results because we were able to purify the CD133 knockout cells using the culture of a single cell colony. In spite of CD133 knockout, CD133<sup>knockout</sup> cells were still made colony, but the colony number was remarkably decreased. Recently, we found activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is upregulated by interleukin (IL)-6 and blocking of the STAT3/CD133/survivin signaling pathway showed anticancer effect in colon cancer <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220860.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As observed in vitro result of the current study, the anticancer effect of stattic (STAT3 inhibitor) showed only in CD133<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220860.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). These results confirmed our previous report, where activated STAT3 was shown to upregulate CD133 expression in colon cancer cells. However, the effect of YM155 was not dependent on CD133 expression.</p><p>We found CD133 knockout by CRISPR-Cas9 extensively inhibited cell migration and invasion of colon cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220860.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Additionally, loss of vimentin expression was observed in CD133<sup>knockout</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220860.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Upregulation of mesenchymal markers, like vimentin, and loss of function of adherent junction protein E-cadherin are typical changes, indicating EMT of cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. CD133<sup>+</sup> cells seemed to have more phenotypes toward mesenchymal cells in colon cancer progression [<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We had reported that CD133 expression was common in the invasive part of adenocarcinoma, which is in contrast to its rare expression in adenoma in the surgically resected clinical sample [<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220860.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The previous studies reported that EMT contributed to the cancer cell invasion and metastasis in several malignant tumors, and several transcription factors which induce EMT might drive solid tumor progression, including colon cancer [<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Zhang et al described that the induction of CXCR4<sup>+</sup> expression by SDF-1 increased EMT and invasive behavior in cancer stem cells[<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Recently, Dinicola <italic>et al</italic>. proved that triggering EMT by nicotine led to increased migration and invasion of colon cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Vimentin has been known as an essential regulating factor of EMT and hypoxia-inducible facot-1 (HIF-1) has been described as a major transcriptional regulator of vimentin [<xref rid="pone.0220860.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Decreased cell migration and invasion abilities might be related to loss of vimentin expression in CD133<sup>knockout</sup> cells, as seen in the current study. These findings reflected that CD133 could play a critical role in tumor progression by regulating the expression of EMT-related molecules in colon cancer. Therefore, we propose further studies to investigate how CD133 and other factors interact with vimentin expression.</p><p>In conclusion, CD133<sup>knockout</sup> cells showed remarkable inhibitory effects on tumorigenic property in colon cancer, including cell proliferation colony formation capacity, migration, and invasion. Therefore, modulating CD133 expression can be an effective treatment strategy for CD133<sup>+</sup> colon cancer by inhibiting characteristics of cancer stem cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by a Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (No.2016R1D1A1A09918958).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0220860.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Kusoglu</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Biray Avci</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>. <article-title>Cancer stem cells: A brief review of the current status</article-title>. <source>Gene</source>. <year>2018</year>;<volume>681</volume>:<fpage>80</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>5</lpage>.
