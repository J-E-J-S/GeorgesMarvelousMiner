Here we introduce the use of targeted multiplex proteomics (TMP) as a tool to simultaneously measure a panel of 54 proteins involved in oncogenic, tumour suppression, drug metabolism and resistance, in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). TMP provided valuable diagnostic information by unmasking an occult neuroendocrine differentiation and identifying a misclassified case based on abnormal proteins phenotype. No significant differences in protein levels between unpaired primary and metastatic samples were observed. Four proteins were found differentially expressed in <italic>KRAS</italic>-mutant as compared to wild-type tumours (overexpressed in mutant: KRAS, EGFR; overexpressed in wild-type: TOPO1, TOP2A). Survival analyses revealed the association between mesothelin expression and poor overall survival, whereas lack of PTEN protein expression associated with lower progression-free survival with anti-EGFR-based therapy in the first-line setting for patients with <italic>RAS</italic> wild-type tumour. Finally, outlier analysis identified putative targetable proteins in 65% of patients lacking a targetable genomic alteration. Our data show that TMP constitutes a promising, novel molecular prescreening tool in mCRC to identify protein expression alterations that may impact on patient outcomes and more precisely guide patient eligibility to clinical trials with novel targeted experimental therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Colon cancer</kwd><kwd>Colon cancer</kwd><kwd>Predictive markers</kwd><kwd>Molecular medicine</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Simultaneous and accurate measurement of many proteins in experimental samples is very important in descriptive and predictive biological research, including comprehensive proteomic surveys, protein network studies, validation of genomic alterations and clinical biomarker development.</p><p id="Par3">The accepted &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; for protein measurement is immunoassay, which uses either one (as in immunohistochemistry or IHC) or two (competitive immunoassays) antigen-specific antibodies. Antibody-antigen binding can be measured across multiple matrices such as in fluids, on the surface of cells, within cells or tissues and in organs. The most widely used platform for tissue-based biomarker analyses is IHC, which facilitates the qualitative expression of proteins while preserving tissue architecture. Despite being a relatively easy and inexpensive approach, IHC has its limitations including reproducibility issues and very poor multiplexing capabilities. It is at best a semiquantitative method and is minimally effective for comprehensive analyses.</p><p id="Par4">Targeted proteomics using selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (SRM-MS) has emerged as a promising and highly sensitive method for the quantification of multiple proteins within the same tissue sample in an antibody-free setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

Isolated tumour cells were then solubilized to tryptic peptides using Liquid Tissue&#x000ae; technology as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. All samples were qualified as evaluable according to the expression levels of the two housekeeping proteins actin and tubulin. We based the selection of the target proteins included in our TMP panel on a literature search for predictive biomarkers of response to targeted/chemo/immunotherapy and also included differentiation proteins with diagnostic value. Among 54 target proteins analysed, 18 (33%) were below the limit of detection of SRM-MS (non-detectable) (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). FGF receptors (FGFR1-3), IGF1R, HGF, and PDL1 were among non-detectable proteins. Thirty-six proteins (67%) were detectable in at least one sample. Levels of expression (amol/&#x003bc;g) of detectable proteins for each individual patient are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> as heatmaps (see also supplementary figure 1 for aggregated data). The threshold for the definition of high protein expression varied by protein. We used predefined criteria when supporting literature was available: &#x02265;4,000&#x02009;amol/&#x003bc;g for EGFR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, &#x02265;750 amol/&#x003bc;g for HER2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and &#x02265;1500&#x02009;amol/&#x003bc;g for cMET<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. These thresholds were shown to be predictive of protein overexpression and/or gene amplification detected by standard IHC and fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. For the remaining ones, SRM-MS levels above the upper 95% confidence interval of the mean were defined as high expression (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Targeted multiplex proteomics heatmap.

Analysis of differentiation markers showed a lack of expression of P63 and TTF1 in all but 2 cases (4%), consistent with the colorectal origin of our samples. One tumour (ID-87) with P63 expression also showed very high levels of EGFR and KRT5, highly suggestive of squamous cell differentiation. Upon histopathological review, the case turned out to be an anal squamous cell carcinoma and, therefore, excluded from further analyses. The only case in our dataset expressing TTF1 was a liver metastasis (ID-51). Thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1) has been considered a highly sensitive and specific marker for primary lung adenocarcinoma. As it is not usually expressed in CRC, TTF1 is used for the differential diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinomas of colorectal versus lung origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The subsequent IHC workup on ID-51 showed strong TTF1 nuclear positivity, KRT20 positivity and KRT7 negativity, a profile pointing to colorectal origin, which was supported by clinical assessment. Five tumours showed detectable levels of CHGA, a marker of neuroendocrine differentiation. IHC analyses confirmed the presence of CHGA positive cells in otherwise conventional adenocarcinomas of the colon, and outlined an occult neuroendocrine differentiation in one case (ID-08) with very high levels (10-times higher than those of the lowest detectable case) (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2A</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">Since samples from both primary tumours (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;25) and metastatic disease (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;24) were included in our cohort, we investigated differences in protein expression levels according to the tissue of origin.

Confirmatory IHC analyses showed that KRT7 expression prevailed in tumour buds present in both primary and metastatic samples as has been previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Worthy of note, entrapped normal epithelial cells from the lung were the main contributor of KRT7 expression in sample ID-53 (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Protein expression in <italic>RAS</italic>-mutated and wild-type tumours</title><p id="Par10">Understanding that <italic>RAS</italic> mutation is a validated stratification factor in mCRC, we then examined differences in proteins levels in <italic>RAS</italic>-mutated (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;21, 43%) versus wild-type cases (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;28, 57%).

However, in aggregate, these predictors are positive in less than 10% of mCRC population, indicating the need for more informative molecular screening approaches. Similarly, the decision to administer standard chemotherapies in the metastatic setting (e.g. FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) remains empirical and does not rely on tumour biomarkers, which could be revealed by a novel multiplatform profiling strategy like ours.</p><p id="Par18">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the potential impact of quantitative targeted proteomics in the context of precision oncology in mCRC. A comprehensive molecular profiling of CRC samples has been previously conducted with a multiplatform approach that includes sequencing, IHC, fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and chromogenic <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization to investigate targetable biomarker aberrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Authors found major differences in the expression of selected proteins across different metastatic sites, reflecting inter-metastatic tumour heterogeneity, although the limited overlap in term of proteins analyzed (only 15 in total) and the different methodology used for protein expression (IHC vs SRM-MS in our study) hampered any comparative analysis.</p><p id="Par19">In our study, we investigated quantitative protein biomarker profiles of mCRC and integrated the results obtained with available clinical, pathological and genomic data towards advancing insights into predictive and prognostic markers. Our TMP panel included proteins involved in oncogenic, tumour suppression, drug metabolism and resistance as well as tumour differentiation markers that could aid in the standard diagnostic decision-making processes as well as the selection of novel targeted drugs and immunotherapies (antibody-drug conjugates or ADC).</p><p id="Par20">The major impact of the use of TMP in mCRC may translate in more precisely matching patients to experimental therapies. Recruitment rates in early clinical trials based on genomic markers or targeted IHC in metastatic CRC does not exceed 15%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. We expect that proteomics-guided drug development will expand treatment options for patients who are eligible to participate in early phase clinical studies, particularly in view of the increasing array of ADCs and immunotherapeutic approaches, thus repurposing proteomics as an important contender in precision oncology.</p><p id="Par21">Until validated thresholds for individual biomarkers become available, outlier expression may be a valuable marker for testing novel experimental therapies in the metastatic setting as well as an enrichment strategy for clinical trials. In our present study, we found 29 outliers in 21 patients without any targetable genomic alteration, 12 of which are potentially useful in more precisely guiding the selection of an investigational ADC therapy (GPNMB, MSLN, and TROP2) or refining a chemotherapy strategy (TOPO1 and TOP2A).</p><p id="Par22">With regards to novel prognostic markers and therapeutic targets, our TMP analysis identified MSLN expression in 30% of metastatic CRC. MSLN is a cell-surface glycoprotein whose expression in normal human tissues is restricted to mesothelial cells. Given that it is highly expressed by many solid tumours (mesotheliomas, pancreatic, gastric and ovarian cancers among others), it represents an attractive target for ADC development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In mCRC, the value of MSLN expression has not been thoroughly investigated. The prognostic association we found between MSLN and poor prognosis has been previously reported in the literature with both tumour and plasma MSLN levels in early-stage CRC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> thus strengthening the role of this protein in CRC biology. This supports its investigation as a therapeutic target in this yet unexplored tumour indication.</p><p id="Par23">We also investigated the value of TMP in patient selection for standard-of-care targeted agents. We recognize the difficulties in identifying predictive markers for anti-EGFR and standard therapies in our cohort since these therapies are administered in combination regimens and the small sample size that together do not allow for the proper study of interactions among different markers and therapies. We did, however, identify an association between a lack of PTEN protein expression and shorter time to progression in the first-line setting with chemotherapy plus anti-EGFR in <italic>RAS</italic> wild-type patients. Previous retrospective studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> showed that this association could well be linked to a prognostic effect of PTEN in this subset of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> as opposed to a predictive value<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par24">Exploratory analysis of proteomics data allowed us to assess the value of complementary data provided by this approach in the context of the molecular diagnostic evaluation of mCRC patients. First, TMP may assist in refining conventional histopathological diagnosis, identifying misdiagnosed cases, and revealing uncommon differentiation that may help clinicians to prioritize alternative treatment regimens. For example, we could confirm an occult neuroendocrine differentiation in one case as well as an atypical proteomics profile which facilitated the identification of a patient sample erroneously submitted as colorectal adenocarcinoma for molecular analyses. Second, primary tumour molecular profiling is generally used for treatment decision even in the metastatic setting where cancer may have acquired new alterations or lost those originally present during carcinogenesis. Our analysis failed to reveal significant differences in protein expression levels between unmatched primary and metastatic samples (continuous protein levels), thus supporting current profiling strategies at least for the targets included in our panel. Finally, comprehensive proteomics analysis may also expose biological differences in clinically or molecularly-defined groups. We examined differences in the biomarker profiles based on <italic>RAS</italic> mutation status. KRAS protein levels were significantly higher in <italic>RAS</italic> mutant vs wild-type CRC, independently of the mutation type. This is not surprising as <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations occurring in codons 12 and 13 of exon 2 induce stabilization of the protein in a constitutive activation state which, in theory, could also facilitate the detection of higher levels of the total protein in mutant tumours as compared to wild-type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. We also found that TOPO1 and TOP2A expression levels were lower in <italic>RAS</italic>-mutated tumours, an association not previously reported in the literature, and that reinforces differences in the biology of these tumours. Higher TOPO1 expression in <italic>RAS</italic> wild-type may favour irinotecan over oxaliplatin in this molecular subgroup, and many trials are assessing irinotecan plus anti-EGFR therapy re-challenge after an initial response in <italic>RAS</italic> wild-type mCRC. Similarly, high TOP2A levels may suggest an increased sensitivity to topoisomerase II inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> in <italic>RAS</italic> wild-type CRC and prompt the exploration of agents not routinely considered as standard-of-care. These results certainly merit further consideration in future clinical trials.</p><p id="Par25">In conclusion, this study opens the door to the application of targeted multiplex proteomics in CRC with a potential impact on patient stratification for precision medicine. Our results reinforce the inter-tumour heterogeneity of CRC with unique protein alterations in individual cases that can guide enrolment in early clinical trials and co-development of biomarkers and drugs. We expect that an expanded TMP panel with proteins that represent targets for ADCs and immune checkpoints may bring novel insights on potential combinatorial immunotherapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Patient selection</title><p id="Par26">Samples of histologically confirmed invasive CRC diagnosed at Vall d&#x02019;Hebron University Hospital (Barcelona, Spain) were retrospectively identified by a study pathologist.
