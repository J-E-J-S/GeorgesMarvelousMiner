Here, we identified and analyzed regulatory mutations having transcriptional consequences in lung adenocarcinoma-derived cell lines. We phased the mutations in the regulatory regions to the downstream heterozygous SNPs in the coding regions and examined whether the ChIP-Seq variant tags of the regulatory SNVs and the RNA-Seq variant tags of their target transcripts showed biased frequency between the mutant and reference alleles. We identified 137 potential regulatory mutations affecting the transcriptional regulation of 146 RefSeq transcripts with at least 84 SNVs that create and/or disrupt potential transcription factor binding sites. For example, in the regulatory region of <italic>NFATC1</italic> gene, a novel and active binding site for the ETS transcription factor family was created. Further examination revealed that 31 of these disruptions were presented in clinical lung adenocarcinoma samples and were associated with prognosis of patients.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Recent advances in the next generation sequencing technology have widened our view on cancer genomes. Substantial number of so-called driver genes have been identified, and how mutations (single nucleotide variations; SNVs) in those genes disrupt the gene functions and drive carcinogenesis processes has been elucidated in a large number of cancers. For example, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has reported genomic mutations in 33 different types of cancers in their initial paper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. They have revealed comprehensive patterns of mutation features in key pathways of many cancer types, including lung adenocarcinoma, that could be used as anti-cancer drug targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and other large-scale research projects, SNVs within coding regions functionally changing the activities of tyrosine kinase and other signaling molecules have also been intensively examined for their possibility as cancer driver mutations.</p><p id="Par3">During the rapid progression in cancer genome analyses, previous studies have mainly focused on the mutations in the protein-coding regions which would invoke alterations in amino acid sequences. On the other hand, SNVs in non-protein-coding regions have not been focused on until recently. Despite the general lack of sufficient annotations on the mutations in the non-coding regulatory regions such as promoter and enhancer elements, recent studies have reported that such &#x0201c;regulatory mutations&#x0201d; should be no less important than coding mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. For example, TERT promoter mutations have been identified in a large number of patients with melanoma and other types of cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. These mutations changed the binding elements of oncogenic transcription factors and consequently enhanced TERT expression. In the ICGC study of liver cancer, whole-genome sequencing analysis of a 300 patients cohort have characterized comprehensive patterns of non-coding and structural alterations that could influence gene expression in cancerous cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Indeed, there have been several pioneering studies that have attempted to comprehensively identify such regulatory mutations. For example, in colon cancer, integrative analysis of genome and transcriptome data has been conducted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, there have been relatively rare cases in which the mutations in the potential regulatory regions could be systematically associated with the aberrant expression of their target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The roles of regulatory mutations could at least be examined when attempting to understand the aberrations occurring at the transcriptional level in the cancer. Deeper insights into these transcriptional signatures of the cancers may lead to comprehensive elucidations of yet undiscovered mechanisms underlying carcinogenesis, metastasis or drug-resistance, which may be related to the prognosis of patients or the identification of novel targets for pharmacological interventions. In our previous study, we generated a multi-omics sequencing catalogue of lung cancer cell lines, including whole genome, epigenome (DNA methylation and eight histone modifications) and transcriptome sequencing data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. We detected a number of somatic SNVs in regions considered to have promoter or enhancer functions. We attempted to distinguish functionally relevant regulatory SNVs from other neutral passenger SNVs. However, in our previous study, it was difficult to directly analyze the potentially functional regulatory SNVs regarding their transcriptome consequences. The difficulty was mostly derived from the fact that short-read sequencers had provided limited information. For most of the cases, it was impossible to associate the SNVs in the regulatory regions to SNVs in the downstream transcribed regions on the same allele, because the distance between them was beyond the reach of short-read sequencers.</p><p id="Par5">To complement the drawback inherent to current short read sequencing technologies, we employed the recently developed GemCode technology (10x Genomics). This enables phasing of the human genome by intensively utilizing molecular barcoding technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In this method, large DNA fragments are confined in oil droplets together with gel-embedded barcodes (GEMs). By hybridization extension, each unique barcode is added to the DNA fragments within the droplet. Barcoded large DNA fragments are, then, mixed, sheared and then subjected to sequencing using Illumina short read sequencers. Long-read sequences originating from the large DNA fragments within a single droplet can be computationally assembled depending on the unique barcode and, by comparing variants on the different barcoded fragments, a large area of the genome could be anchored by those variants (SNPs) and thus &#x0201c;phased.&#x0201d; The reads used for anchoring the fragments are called &#x0201c;linked reads&#x0201d; and play a key role in this &#x0201c;synthetic long read sequencing&#x0201d; method.</p><p id="Par6">Earlier studies mostly relied on genome-wide associations or chromatin immunoprecipitations to identify regulatory SNVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In this study, we included phasing of regulatory SNVs (which we identified in our previous study using Illumina sequencing) with their transcribed regions via GemCode technology. We also examined whether those SNVs have altered regulatory functions by examining any bias in allele expressions of downstream transcripts by RNA-Seq. For this purpose, we conducted a single-allele resolution expression analysis using ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq data (see below for more details). We also generated and utilized TSS-Seq data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> to precisely determine the transcriptional starting sites (TSSs) in the target cells, which were essential for defining the regulatory and transcribed regions, as well as considering novel regulatory regions. Here, we describe the analysis of the functional consequences of SNVs located in possible transcriptional regulatory regions with regards to allele expression of their regulated transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>10x GemCode synthetic long read sequencing enables phasing of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines</title><p id="Par7">In our previous study, we constructed a multi-omics sequencing catalogue of a series of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. We have investigated what types of genomic, epigenomic and transcriptional aberrations are present in a total of 23 cell lines; these aberrations span diverse driver mutation patterns in the protein-coding regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. We also identified an average of 46,407 mutations in the regulatory regions identified by eight active or repressive histone markers (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K9/14ac, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3 and Pol II) for each cell line (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). To further characterize these potential regulatory SNVs, we first attempted to associate regulatory SNVs with their transcribed regions based on the &#x0201c;phasing.&#x0201d; For this purpose, we applied the synthetic long read sequencing technology (10x Genomics GemCode) to the lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A and B</xref>). We limited the target SNVs for the phasing to those called from whole-genome sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> (see Material and Methods for the re-mapping procedure to the UCSC hg38; see also Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> for more details). An average of 4,038,252 SNVs were used per cell line. For the GemCode system, we employed target-capture sequencing for whole-exome and regulatory regions (113.7&#x02009;Mb), which were designed to include exons, promoters, enhancers and differentially methylated DNA regions based on the ENCODE project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. An average of 45,679,789 paired-end reads (53x average depths for the bait regions) were obtained per cell line (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

From the GemCode analysis, we obtained an average of 7,004 phased blocks per cell line with mean length of 55&#x02009;kb (maximum length: 1.7&#x02009;Mb; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Each phased block spanned an average of 13 SNVs (maximum: 702) and contained 3 haplotypes on average (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B and C</xref>). An average of 3,884 (89,333 total) regulatory SNVs were associated with 1,742 (40,073 total) phased blocks, which were 130&#x02009;kb in length on average. In these phased blocks with regulatory SNVs, an average of two regulatory SNVs were associated with a total of 33 SNVs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). We further selected cases in which the regulatory SNVs were associated with the SNVs in the transcribed regions of the RefSeq transcripts. An average of 3,391 (78,006 total) regulatory SNVs in 1,389 (31,967 total) phased blocks per cell were associated with the SNVs in the transcribed regions of 3,018 RefSeq transcripts.

Namely, the C allele (reference allele) was phased to the T-A-C allele, while the CA allele (mutant allele) was phased to the C-G-G allele in the transcript region. Of note, we analyzed the phased blocks and found that these cells have an average of three haplotypes per cell line which was comparable to the public COSMIC database, which reported an average ploidy of 3.04 for 17 of 23 cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).

Due to its limited sequencing yield, we could map a total of 674,333 and 511,982 of mostly 2D reads from H1975 and RERF-LC-KJ, and 5,620,315 1D and 1D<sup>2</sup> reads from LC2/ad to the UCSC hg38 human reference genome, which collectively covered 46%, 36% and 93% of the genome, respectively.

If the SNPs/SNVs-containing RNA-Seq tags were differentially represented between the alleles, it should be regarded as an indicator of those alleles being under mutually distinct regulations. When all the cell lines were taken together, we identified 107,155 (18,330 per cell line) SNVs in the coding regions of 29,251 RefSeq transcripts (1,271 per cell line) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>).

It is true that the lineage-specific imprinting of these genes may also contribute to the unique patterns of genomic or transcriptional aberrations in lung adenocarcinoma compared with cancers of other lineages. However, for simplicity, we removed all of these cases in this study. For this purpose, we removed transcripts in which allele-biased expression was observed in more than 1/3 of the cell lines regardless of the diverse mutation patterns in the regulatory regions. A total of 124 transcripts in 76 genes were classified as imprinted transcripts (also see Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S6</xref> for the list and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref> for GO analysis). The cases that were removed as possible &#x0201c;lineage or sex-imprinting&#x0201d; cases are also exemplified by the <italic>BCLAF1</italic> and <italic>MAP2K3</italic> genes in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>. We further examined the cases of possible X chromosome inactivation/mono-allele in female and male cell lines. Cell lines of female origins showed a remarkably higher number of heterozygous variants on X chromosome (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>) compared to those of male origins. We also noted that one cell line of unknown origin (RERF-LC-OK) is likely of female origin, based on the collected information. Interestingly, most of the cell lines, either male or female, did not exhibit complete imbalance/mono-allele patterns. Complex phenomenon(s) such as aneuploidy, copy number aberrations in male cell lines, or re-activation of the X chromosome in female cell lines may have taken place. Those aberrations may have occurred at the carcinogenesis stages of the cells or may have been induced during the long culture history of the cells.</p><p id="Par14">We also looked for cases of known imprinting genes by referencing previously reported human imprinted genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and found a total of 67 transcripts in 17 genes.

Active chromosome markers (Pol II and H3K9/14ac) were found only on the &#x0201c;T&#x0201d; allele, while the &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; allele was silent.

No significant correlations between the patterns of the regulatory mutations and driver genes were found.</p><p id="Par21">We next examined whether the regulatory mutations affect that sequence contexts of specific regulatory motifs. We found that 29 regulatory mutations were located in CpG sites, which may affect DNA methylation status in the regulatory regions (upper panel, Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>).</p><p id="Par22">In several cases, the regulatory mutations were also located in transcription factor binding sites. We examined the ChIP-Seq data of transcription factors (TFs) in A549 cell line using the ENCODE dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and found that 49 of the identified regulatory mutations overlapped with the ChIP-Seq peaks (middle panel, Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>; also see Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S7</xref>). For example, A427 cell line had an SNV in the promoter region (chr17:5191978&#x02009;C&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;G) of the <italic>ZNF594</italic> gene and the mutant allele was transcriptionally silent (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9</xref>). This regulatory SNV overlapped with several TF ChIP-Seq peaks including <italic>POLR2A</italic>, <italic>TAF1</italic> and <italic>MYC</italic>, according to the ENCODE dataset. This SNV is also located at 110&#x02009;bp upstream of the transcription start site (chr17:5191868) as defined by TSS-Seq, suggested that the core promoter activity was silenced.</p><p id="Par23">For more comprehensive analyses, we examined transcription factor binding consensus sequences using the TRANSFAC database, looking for possible disruption or acquisition of new motifs in the &#x000b1;10&#x02009;bp region of the identified regulatory SNVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and found 84 such regulatory SNVs (lower panel, Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>; also see Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S7</xref>). For example, H1650 cell line harbored a promoter mutation (chr1:110389770, G&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;GAA) and this mutation created a binding motif for the AP-4 transcriptional factor (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). The mutant allele was transcriptionally silenced; thus this newly acquired TF binding might work as a transcriptional repressor. In another example, in RERF-LC-Ad1 cell line, a regulatory SNV (chr18:79395018&#x02009;C&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;G) was found in the region of <italic>NFATC1</italic> gene. In this cell line, this gene showed almost complete allele-specific transcription from the mutant allele (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>). The location of this SNV overlapped with the binding location of <italic>RNF2</italic> based on the A549 cell line analysis of the ENCODE data (left, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9C</xref>). The <italic>RNF2</italic> gene encodes one of the polycomb group proteins and has a role in transcriptional repression, which suggests that <italic>NFATC1</italic> should be transcriptionally repressed via the recruitment of <italic>RNF2</italic> in A549 cell line (or other cell lines with wildtype <italic>NFATC1</italic> alleles). On the other hand, in this cell line, the regulatory mutation generated a novel binding site of the ETS family of transcription activators (CG<underline>G</underline>AAG, Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>).</p><p id="Par24">To biologically validate this novel transcription factor binding site, we performed the luciferase assay of mutant and wildtype alleles and detected 3 fold increases in enhancer activity of the mutant allele compared to the wildtype allele (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4F and G</xref>). To solidify this result, we also conducted ChIP-qPCR for <italic>ETS1</italic>, a major transcription factor in the ETS family, targeting the region &#x000b1;100&#x02009;bps around the regulatory SNV. We detected 4&#x02013;6 folds enrichments of the <italic>ETS1</italic> binding in the location of the regulatory SNV (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4F and H</xref>). Sanger sequencing of qPCR products also showed bias towards the mutant allele (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4I</xref>). We believe that these results ensured our notion regarding the creation of the ETS family binding site and supported the validity of our approach.</p><p id="Par25">The <italic>NFATC1</italic> gene itself is also a transcription factor that is associated with immune responses. Even though expression level of the <italic>NFATC1</italic> gene in RERF-LC-Ad1 cell line is not particularly high (right, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9C</xref>), previous studies reported that <italic>NFATC1</italic> promoted migration of the tumor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and aberrant activations also correlated with tumor migration and invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

Among these, 104 SNVs were further characterized to change the binding consensus of transcription factor binding sites as defined by TRANSFAC or overlap with previous ENCODE ChIP-Seq analyses of transcription factors and chromatin remodeling factor binding. Particularly, we identified several regulatory aberrations that may also occur in clinical samples using TCGA datasets and a number of these aberrations also associated with prognosis of patients. We believe this is the first comprehensive attempt to systematically identify and characterize the SNVs having regulatory roles, and by using cell lines as starting materials, we were able to obtain large amount of multi-omics and long read data with relatively ease.</p><p id="Par28">Despite the general success, we also noticed that the collected dataset is still far from complete. First, the population of the successfully characterized SNVs was limited to 137 out of a total of 1,794 SNVs (7.6%). These drops were mostly derived from the lack of solid information on phasing. In this study, to expedite the analysis, we utilized a hybridization capture method with bait covering only exon and regulome regions. However, recent analyses gradually revealed that many of the enhancer elements are tissue-type or occasionally cell-type specific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, thus, it was difficult to cover all the regulatory regions using singly designed capture panels. Additionally, we found that the GemCode Long Ranger software is not optimized for phasing non-diploid genomes as described in their original publication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. To circumvent the potential multi ploidy-related problem, we employed the re-assemble method by directly inspecting the phasing information using Molecular Indexes (MIs; see Materials and Methods for details) in 10x Long Ranger results. We achieved an average of 13 SNVs phased in 55&#x02009;kb length block and 33 SNVs and 130&#x02009;kb in the blocks of interest (i.e. regulatory SNVs), which we believe should be adequate for further analysis. Also, we observed an average of three haplotypes per cell line, which is comparable to reports in the COSMIC database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). However, at individual cell line level, some discrepancies were observed. The discrepancy may have been derived from both over- and under-estimations of the haplotypes. Overestimation could arise from the conservative merging of the &#x0201c;local&#x0201d; SNPs, unless sufficient evidence supported the &#x0201c;merging&#x0201d; of the possible haplotypes, we left the haplotypes &#x0201c;un-merged.&#x0201d; Underestimation may have happened when only a part of the haplotypes were represented by the detected SNPs. At the same time, we employed generally strict parameters to avoid miss-identifications and strictly utilized only SNPs to SNPs associations which were not subjected to the problems of haplotype assembly. Indeed, we took a conservative approach, since we were concerned that the genes which may have the largest biological significance would reside in the regions of aneuploidy or regions with complicated copy number aberrations. To more thoroughly address this issue, carefully designed novel algorithms that incorporate other modes of detection should be developed.</p><p id="Par29">Second, the currently available information of the transcription binding sites is still limited. We could examine the 50 ENCODE ChIP-Seq datasets that encompass a total of 41 types of transcription factors. Still, 24% of the identified potential regulatory SNVs remained elusive regarding their responsive trans-factors even though putative involvement of particular transcription factors is inferred from the binding consensus searches.</p><p id="Par30">We consider this work a proof of concept study that could serve as a gateway towards better understanding of transcriptional regulatory aberrations in cancers. Indeed, in-depth understanding of the biological relevance of the aberrant transcriptional regulation, namely, how a large number of non-coding mutations that are being detected in cancer genomes collectively contribute to the etiology of cancers, may also serve as a potential approach for developing better therapeutic methods based on these completely novel concepts. Further technical development will allow us to directly collect transcriptome and epigenome data from clinical samples and long read technologies are also making rapid progress, which would enable more comprehensive studies. By first providing a link between the untracked regulatory alterations and the aberrant transcriptomic consequences in cancers, this study has provided a stepping stone towards that goal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Cell lines</title><p id="Par31">All human lung cancer cell lines and small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) were cultured and harvested as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Synthetic long reads library preparation by 10x GemCode</title><p id="Par32">From the 23 cell lines, high molecular weight DNA was extracted and quantified using Qiagen MagAttract HMW kit according to manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations (10x Genomics, Qiagen #67653).

First, relationships between heterozygous SNVs called in conventional whole genome sequencing and MIs from the 10x GemCode were established by constructing an index of SNVs with respect to the MIs (i.e., which grouping of SNVs were supported by each MI) and vice versa (how many MIs were supporting each SNV) by cross-referencing lists of SNVs called by GATK from whole genome sequencings to the 10x GemCode Long Ranger (version 1.3) bam file. Using an exhaustive approach, we merged compatible MIs together to form a &#x0201c;preliminary haplotype&#x0201d;; MIs were deemed compatible if at least one SNV position overlapped and the nucleotide base matched. MIs with different bases were not merged into the same &#x0201c;preliminary haplotype&#x0201d; but would be designated another &#x0201c;preliminary haplotype&#x0201d; in the same phase block; this process would be done exhaustively until every MI was considered and each MI could be a member of more than one haplotype. Only reads with score&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;20 and SNVs with score&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;20 (if applicable) were considered.</p><p id="Par44">Due to randomness in the distribution of barcoding coverage, it was possible that two adjacent SNVs in the same phase block would not share a preliminary haplotype even after all possible merging. Practically, this would result in phase block with multiple short and isolated preliminary haplotypes, which would not be very useful. To address this, we performed a second merging of the preliminary haplotype in the same phase block to create a final &#x0201c;haplotype&#x0201d; for that phase block via a greedy approach. First, by comparing each &#x0201c;preliminary haplotype&#x0201d; to the associated phase block overall coverage, each preliminary haplotype&#x02019;s missing genomic positions (if any) were determined; then, for preliminary haplotypes with missing positions (starting from those with the fewest) we searched for the most similar haplotype that could fill the gaps. Similarity was determined by the number of compatible SNVs subtracted by the number of un-compatible SNVs, 0 was set for pairs without SNVs occupying the same genomic positions. The process would be repeated until the final haplotype was compete (no missing positions) and no more preliminary haplotypes remained. The results (final haplotypes) were then used in further analyses (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> for graphic representation).</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Analysis of HiC data</title><p id="Par45">HiC data of A549 cell line (ENCSR662QKG) was obtained from the ENCODE/GGR dataset (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.encodeproject.org/">https://www.encodeproject.org/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.
