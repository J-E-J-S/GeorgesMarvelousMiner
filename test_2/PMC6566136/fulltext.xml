They show potent and selective killing activity against major fungal pathogens and low toxicity to other eukaryotic and bacterial cells. These properties make them a promising alternative to fulfill the need of novel antifungals with potential applications in crop protection, food preservation, and medical therapies. However, the difficulties of cost-effective manufacturing of PAFs by chemical synthesis or biotechnological production in microorganisms have hampered their development for practical use. This work explores the feasibility of using rice seeds as an economical and safe production system of PAFs. The rationally designed PAF102 peptide with improved antifungal properties was selected for assessing PAF biotechnological production. Two different strategies are evaluated: (1) the production as a single peptide targeted to protein bodies and (2) the production as an oleosin fusion protein targeted to oil bodies. Both strategies are designed to offer stability to the PAF peptide in the host plant and to facilitate its downstream purification. Our results demonstrate that PAF does not accumulate to detectable levels in rice seeds when produced as a single peptide, whereas it is successfully produced as fusion protein to the Oleosin18, up to 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of peptide per gram of grain. We show that the expression of the chimeric <italic>Ole18-PAF102</italic> gene driven by the <italic>Ole18</italic> promoter results in the specific accumulation of the fusion protein in the embryo and aleurone layer of the rice seed. Ole18-PAF102 accumulation has no deleterious effects on seed yield, germination capacity, or seedling growth. We also show that the Oleosin18 protein serves as carrier to target the fusion protein to oil bodies facilitating PAF102 recovery. Importantly, the recovered PAF102 is active against the fungal phytopathogen <italic>Fusarium proliferatum</italic>. Altogether, our results prove that the oleosin fusion technology allows the production of PAF bioactive peptides to assist the exploitation of these antifungal compounds.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PAF</kwd><kwd>antifungal</kwd><kwd>pathogens</kwd><kwd>fungi</kwd><kwd>rice</kwd><kwd>seed</kwd><kwd>oil bodies</kwd><kwd>protein bodies</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn1">SEPSAPE</funding-source><award-id rid="cn1">EUI2008-03769</award-id><award-id rid="cn1">EUI2008-03619</award-id><award-id rid="cn1">BIO2015-68790-C2-2-R</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn2">Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovaci&#x000f3;n y Universidades</funding-source><award-id rid="cn2">SEV-2015-0533</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="46"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="8666"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infections caused by fungi pose a serious threat to human and animal health and to food security and safety (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Fisher et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). Invasive fungal diseases have significantly increased in recent decades and are important causes of mortality, particularly in immunocompromised patients, killing about one and a half million people every year. This value exceeds the death rate for malaria or breast cancer (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Brown et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). Plant disease epidemics caused by fungi and fungal-like oomycetes are an old problem that have been further exacerbated by intensive agricultural practices, globalization, and climate change (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Bebber and Gurr, 2015</xref>). Today, crop-destroying fungi account globally for yield losses of ~20%, with further 10% postharvest losses (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Fisher et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). In addition, food safety is challenged by mycotoxigenic fungi that contaminate food and feed with detrimental toxins for human health. The limited number of licensed antifungals currently available, together with the unprecedented rise of multidrug-resistant pathogenic fungi, makes crucial the development of novel antifungal compounds to combat fungal infections (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Perfect, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Fisher et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are being actively explored to fulfill the need of novel antifungals with potential applications in crop protection, food preservation, and medical therapies.</p><p>AMPs are peptides and small proteins produced by most living organisms that exhibit lytic or inhibitory activity against microorganisms (<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Zasloff, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Gallo, 2016</xref>). However, most AMPs are obtained at low yields from natural sources, and some of them show properties, such as low stability or low specificity, that might compromise their applications. Their peptidic nature enables the rational design of novel molecules with improved properties to be produced at high yields through biotechnological systems. PAF102 was designed as a novel antifungal peptide with improved properties and optimized to be produced in biofactories (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-Garc&#x000ed;a et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). PAF102 is a modified concatemer of the hexapeptide PAF26 (RKKWFW), which was identified through a combinatorial approach as a Peptide with specific AntiFungal activity (PAF) (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-Garc&#x000ed;a et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Mu&#x000f1;oz et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). PAF102 shows potent antifungal activity against economically relevant phytopathogens and very low toxicity to other eukaryotic cells, including human erythrocytes. The antifungal mechanism of PAF102 is similar to that of the parental PAF26, and it involves the interaction with the fungal cell envelope, followed by cell penetration and intracellular effects that cause cell death (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Mu&#x000f1;oz et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-Garc&#x000ed;a et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). This mode-of-action is different to the one of licensed antifungal drugs; thus, PAF peptides might be an alternative to combat fungal pathogens. However, the difficulties of cost-effective manufacturing of PAFs by chemical synthesis, or by conventional microbial-based production systems associated to host toxicity, have hampered their development for practical use.</p><p>Plants provide a platform for the production of AMPs that offer advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness and scalability as they are economical and easy to grow, as well as of safety because of the low risk of contamination with human and animal pathogens (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Twyman et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Particularly, rice seeds have been reported as efficient bioreactors of AMPs, including natural or rational designed peptides (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Bund&#x000f3; et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Montesinos et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). AMP production is favored by limiting their accumulation to seeds that avoids the negative impacts on plant performance reported in some cases when accumulated in vegetative tissues (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Coca et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Nadal et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Company et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Several seed-specific promoters are now available to drive strong expression of <italic>AMP</italic> genes either in the rice endosperm or embryo (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Qu and Takaiwa, 2004</xref>). Among endosperm-specific promoters are the ones from the seed storage proteins glutelins and globulins, including the <italic>GluB1</italic>, <italic>GluB4</italic>, and <italic>Glb1</italic> promoters; and among embryo-specific promoters are the ones from the oleosin proteins, such as the <italic>Ole18</italic> promoter. Another factor that favors the production of AMPs in seeds is their confinement into storage organelles, such as protein bodies (PBs) or oil bodies (OBs) (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Bund&#x000f3; et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Montesinos et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Storage organelles offer a stable environment for packing a large amount of AMPs, together with host cell protection from AMP exposure. Proteins can be targeted to PBs through signal peptides linked at their N-terminus and/or KDEL sequence at their C-terminus, together through intrinsic physicochemical properties in certain storage proteins (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Khan et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Takaiwa et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). OB targeting is achieved using oleosin proteins as carriers (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">van Rooijen and Moloney, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Montesinos et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Oleosins are the most abundant structural proteins of plant seed OBs, whose lipophilic character and secondary structure determine their association to OBs (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Abell et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>). Both PBs and OBs have served to stabilize AMPs in rice seeds and to reach high yields (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Bund&#x000f3; et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Montesinos et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>This work explores the feasibility of using rice seeds as a platform for the production of cell-penetrating antifungal PAF peptides, exemplified as PAF102. Two different strategies are evaluated: (1) the production as a single peptide targeted to PBs or (2) the production as an oleosin fusion protein targeted to OBs. Here, we report that PAF103, a His-tagged and KDEL-extended PAF102, was not accumulated to detectable levels in rice seeds, whereas PAF102 was successfully produced as fusion to the Ole18 protein in rice seeds. We demonstrate that the Ole18-PAF102 fusion protein was accumulated in OBs without affecting seed yield or germination capacity. We also show that biologically active PAF102 can be recovered from rice OBs. Our results demonstrate that the oleosin fusion technology is a good strategy for the production of PAF antifungal peptides.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec3"><title>Preparation of Plant Expression Vectors</title><p>Four different constructs were prepared for the expression of the synthetic <italic>PAF</italic> genes in rice seeds (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).

This implies that the specificity of these peptides relies in the interaction with the fungal cell envelope and the subsequent internalization. Once the peptide is inside the cell, it might be active and killing other cells different than fungal cells, such as bacteria cells. We speculate that the peptide produced in any cell factory could be toxic when it accumulates intracellularly, unless fused to a carrier such as the oleosin, as demonstrated in this study. The fusion of PAF102 to the Ole18 protein targeted the peptide to the OBs, where it remains stable during long-time storage and accumulates to high amounts of up to 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/g of seeds for such small peptides (3.9&#x000a0;kDa).</p><p>The production of PAFs as single peptides was approached using three different promoters, namely <italic>pGluB1</italic>, <italic>pGluB4</italic>, and <italic>pGlb1</italic>, which drive strong endosperm-specific expression. Our approach was based on targeting the peptide to PBs with the three corresponding seed storage protein signal peptides and the KDEL extension to produce the derivative PAF103. These SPs are known to guide protein sorting into PBs, including antimicrobial peptides (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000fc;ntz, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Yang et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Ibl and Stoger, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Bund&#x000f3; et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Montesinos et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Takaiwa et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). The KDEL extension was introduced because it normally increases protein accumulation levels in PBs (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Takagi et&#x000a0;al., 2005b</xref>; <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Takaiwa et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). The two glutelin promoters, namely <italic>pGluB1</italic> and <italic>pGluB4</italic>, have been reported to direct expression to the outer endosperm and have been successfully used to express the <italic>Cecropin A</italic> gene, encoding a small, linear, and cationic antimicrobial peptide (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Bund&#x000f3; et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). The globulin promoter directs the expression to the inner endosperm and worked better than <italic>pGluB1</italic> and <italic>pGluB4</italic> for the expression of the <italic>BP178</italic> gene, encoding also a synthetic small, linear, and cationic antimicrobial peptide (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Montesinos et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Although we showed that all the three promoters directed the expression of the gene to the rice seeds, we could not detect the product using different methods. Failed detection supports that the peptide did not accumulate in the rice seed. Given that all the rice plants expressing the <italic>PAF</italic> transgenes showed normal growth and development, and no altered seed filling and yield, cytotoxic effects seem not to be responsible for the lack of PAF accumulation. The most plausible reason is peptide instability in plant tissues. Further experiments are needed to understand why these peptides are not accumulated in rice seeds. Whatever was the reason, our results clearly show difficulties to produce PAFs as single peptides in rice seeds.</p><p>A better strategy for the production of this type of peptides is the fusion to the Ole18 protein. The fusion protein guided by the oleosin is embedded in OBs where peptides are immobilized and inactivated. Our assays clearly show that Ole18-PAF102 does not exhibit <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against fungi, but as soon as it is released from the Ole18 it becomes active. The immobilization in OBs confers protection and offers stability to PAF102, allowing its accumulation. In our experiments, the amount of PAF102 reached up to 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/g of seed, which taking into account the low molecular weight of the peptide (3.9&#x000a0;kDa), corresponds to 5.1 nmoles/g of seed. This yield is a little lower than the one obtained with cecropin A using the same production strategy (8 nmoles/g) (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Montesinos et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>), but still on the average of reported yields for small peptides in rice seeds (0.03&#x02013;10 nmoles/g of seed) (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Yasuda et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Takagi et&#x000a0;al., 2005a</xref>,<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>, <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>, <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Wakasa et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>), or even proteins, such as lysozyme yielding up to 80&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/g (5.6 nmoles/g of seed) when produced from a single expression cassette or 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/g (10.5 nmoles/g of seed) from two independent expression cassettes (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Hennegan et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). Most of these recombinant proteins were produced in the rice endosperm, which accounts for most of the grain volume (90%), whereas our strategy of protein accumulation in OBs is restricted to the rice embryo and the aleurone layer that represents only 10% of the rice grain volume. It would be interesting to explore the production of PAF102&#x000a0;in OB-rich seeds such as safflower, sesame, rapeseed, soybean, or sunflower. These oily seeds have been used to produce recombinant proteins using the oleosin fusion technology (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Parmenter et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Boothe et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Nykiforuk et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). Reported yield ranges from 0.13% of total protein for insulin in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> seeds (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Nykiforuk et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>), 0.27% for hirudin in <italic>Brassica napus</italic> seeds (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Parmenter et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>), to 0.55% for human growth factor protein in safflower (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Boothe et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). Taking into account that rice grain is not particularly rich in OBs, and our PAF yield in rice is 0.025% of seed proteins, we predict that commercial relevant values might be reached in oily seeds. Therefore, our proof-of-concept study indicates that the technology of oleosin fusion might be the best strategy to produce PAF peptides with the projection to improve yields in oily crops.</p><p>In addition to offer stability, OB accumulation facilitates the purification of PAFs from plant material by simple flotation in dense sucrose solutions. However, the PAF102 immobilized in the OBs was not active and required to be released from the Ole18 for activity. Equally, the antimicrobial peptide CecA did not exhibit activity while immobilized on the OBs (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Montesinos et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>), whereas other proteins have been reported to be active while associated to OBs, such as the &#x000df;-glucuronidase (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">van Rooijen and Moloney, 1995</xref>), a xylanase (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Liu et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Hung et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>), the D-hydantoinase (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Chiang et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>), or the D-psicose-3-epimerase (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Tseng et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>), among others. The lack of activity shown by the antimicrobial peptide PAF102 while immobilized in OBs might be related to its mode of action. Being attached to OBs might prevent the PAF102 internalization into fungal cells, a process that is required for its antifungal action (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Mu&#x000f1;oz et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-Garc&#x000ed;a et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Appropriately, antifungal activity was recovered upon release from OBs by TEV protease digestion, exhibiting equivalent activity against <italic>F. proliferatum</italic> to the synthetic peptide. Therefore, our results show that biologically active PAFs can be produced <italic>in planta</italic>.</p><p>Although rice seeds are starchy more than oily, and they might not be the best host for production of oleosin fusion proteins, they offer unique opportunities as bioreactors since the rice gene transfer technology is well developed, cropping conditions are easy and well-established worldwide, and high grain yield can be obtained (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Stoger et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Takaiwa et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, the accumulation in seeds provides long-term stability during storage at room temperature, up to 3&#x000a0;years in the case of PAF102. Seeds can be stockpiled without the need to synchronize production with product demand. Additionally, the OBs are restricted to the embryo cells and aleurone layer in the rice grain. Thus, the production of the Ole18-PAF fusion protein driven by the <italic>Ole18</italic> promoter was only found in these specific tissues. Along with the embryo, the seed coats, including aleurone and pericarp, are separated during rice milling to obtain the white refined grain and remain as the rice bran by-product. Consequently, downstream purification is facilitated using the PAF102-enriched rice bran as the starting plant material. The use of rice bran for the production of PAFs could add an extra value to this by-product assisting their exploitation to bring them to market.</p></sec><sec id="sec19"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Mouse polyclonal antibodies were produced at the Laboratory Animal Facilities (registration number B9900083) of the Center for Research and Development (CID) from Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), in strict accordance with the bioethical principles established by the Spanish legislation following international guidelines.
