Wound slough isolated from human chronic wounds and transferred to mice was recently shown to create polymicrobial infection in mice, and there is potential this tool may be improved by cryogenic preservation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the application of cryogenic preservation to transferring polymicrobial communities, specifically by quantifying the effects of cryopreservation and wound microbiome transplantation. Slough from an established murine polymicrobial surgical excision model and five patients were subjected to three preservation strategies: refrigeration until infection, freezing in liquid nitrogen, or freezing in liquid nitrogen with glycerol solution prior to infection in individual mice. Four days following inoculation onto mice, wound microbiota were quantified using either culture isolation or by 16s rRNA gene community profiling and quantitative PCR. Cryogenic preservation did not significantly reduce bacterial viability. Reestablished microbial communities were significantly associated with patient of origin as well as host context (i.e., originally preserved from a patient versus mouse infection). Whereas preservation treatment did not significantly shape community composition, the transfers of microbiomes from human to mouse were characterized by reduced diversity and compositional changes. These findings indicated that changes should be expected to occur to community structure after colonization, and that compositional change is likely due to the rapid change in infection context as opposed to preservation strategy. Furthermore, species that were present in higher relative abundance in wound inoculate were more likely to colonize subsequent wounds, and wound inoculate with higher bacterial load established wound communities that were more compositionally similar. Results inform expectations for the complementation of chronic wound in vivo modeling with cryogenic preservation archives.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Raw sequence data were deposited with the NCBI (Accession number: SRA676483).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>Raw sequence data were deposited with the NCBI (Accession number: SRA676483).</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic wounds and associated treatment continues to be a burden on patients and the healthcare system, frequently resulting in high financial costs, recalcitrant infections, and devastating outcomes such as amputation [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221565.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Wound etiologies can vary [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], but there is general agreement that infection by various microbial species directly interfere with the normal healing process and cause wounds to persist [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The treatment of wound infections is complicated by biofilm formation, which is characterized by enhanced resistance to host immune responses and antimicrobial perturbation [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221565.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

Wound microbiomes are usually polymicrobial in nature, with diversity in the community composition of bacterial and fungal species [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221565.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221565.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221565.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221565.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The importance of addressing the multitude of species present within a wound is supported by studies demonstrating significant temporal variation in wound community structure and the ability for relatively low abundant species to later dominate the wound microbiome [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221565.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Approaching the care and research of chronic wound infections as dynamic polymicrobial biofilms is thus necessary to understand the complex dynamics underlying chronic wound microbiomes.</p><p>In practice, the investigation of chronic wounds and polymicrobial infections is met with various challenges.

Several chronic wound <italic>in vivo</italic> models have been employed to study infection dynamics including various murine models [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221565.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the rabbit ear model [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221565.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221565.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], the porcine model [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and an <italic>ex vivo</italic> skin explant model [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

There are purposes for working from stocks of carefully archived strains, but a limitation is that doing so may not accurately reflect the dynamics of chronic wound biofilm phenotypes nor their communities [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221565.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The ability of patient-isolated samples to re-establish polymicrobial biofilm communities in a murine model was recently investigated [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] where it was reported that 81% of wound isolates were able to reproduce polymicrobial infections between mouse and patient, though the compositional similarity between the microbiota of these samples was not thoroughly evaluated in that work. Furthermore, a technical challenge associated with studies integrating clinical and live animal approaches is the ability to isolate wound slough at the clinic, transport samples, and then perform infection procedures in a timely manner [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The archival of question-relevant tissue enables experimental designs that address complex biological patterns, such as those that are temporal in nature or otherwise difficult to survey [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221565.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In particular, cryogenic biobanking of tissues enhances genomic, transcriptomic, and metagenomic research by preserving sample quality through time [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221565.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Cryopreservation at -80&#x000b0;C has been demonstrated to maintain bacterial cell preparation viability up to 10 years and storage in vapor phase liquid nitrogen (&#x0003c; -139&#x000b0;C) up to 30 years [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The benefit of archiving samples at ultra-cold temperatures is that molecular activity is minimal below -139&#x000b0;C, thus reducing chemical reactions and promoting cellular integrity [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Cell wall structure has been indicated to affect cell viability, with Gram-negative bacteria being less viable than Gram-positive species after freezing [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. To counteract this selective effect, the use of cryoprotectants (e.g., glycerol) or initial ultra-cooling by liquid nitrogen has been advised [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221565.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, the above referenced work was based on monoclonal cultures, and it is currently unknown how polymicrobial communities respond to freezing. Thus, the aim of the current study was to investigate microbiome community viability following cryogenic preservation, as well as to characterize sources of variation in microbiome community composition following re-establishment in a murine model after cryogenic archival by using a pre-established wound community in mice and communities from patient wounds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Had freeze treatments posed a significant reduction on the viability of sampled microbiota, a demographic bottleneck for bacterial lineages would have resulted in a loss of microbial species in wound models, and no significant reduction in alpha diversity was observed across preservation strategies. However, a significant loss of diversity was recorded in the process of transferring wound communities from human to mouse indicating host-specific effects on species establishment. A related potential hypothesis when reestablishing polymicrobial communities is that the cryogenic process may select for specific lineages that are robust to freezing and thawing. Literature has suggested that the cell wall characteristics of Gram negative bacteria may reduce species viability after freezing [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In the current study, variability in colonization success could not be attributed to Gram stain or aerotolerance, and it is possible that biofilm material provides a protective effect. A refined assessment of cryogenic selection on bacterial lineages could be later achieved by PMA-Seq [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Finding mice microbiota to be different from their respective patient microbiota is unsurprising given the change in host context from human to mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221565.g003">Fig 3</xref>). However, patient of origin consistently explained more variation than preservation type and mice of same patient origin were most similar to each other. These findings indicate colonization by slough is achieved, however the colonization process may be expected to vary among replicates, and commonly only a few species detected in the patient wounds were later detected in the mouse wounds. The relatively small sample size of patients included in this study did not allow for a complete sampling of microbes routinely observed in the wound clinic, but microbes observed in the current study are commonly reported [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> appeared to dominate most mouse wounds, even when only present in relatively minute proportions of the prior patient community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221565.g003">Fig 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221565.s002">S1 Table</xref>). This is consistent with prior work which saw <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> average relative abundance more than doubled from patient to mice [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Differences in observed wound microbiota could have also been due to wound heterogeneity within biofilm material, however inoculum load explained a significant portion of variation in community similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221565.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Furthermore, patient of origin was also found to significantly explain variation in bacterial load among mice, indicating a positive relationship between the bacterial load in patient isolate and the load after colonization in mice.</p><p>Bacterial load and the prior relative abundance of individual species were positively associated with colonization success (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221565.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221565.g005">5</xref>). Bacterial load has been previously documented to impact viability after freezing [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and infection into animal models [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] with monoclonal samples. Results presented here show that bacterial load can also serve as a predictor of colonization success in polyclonal samples, as increased bacterial bioburden yielded model wounds that were more similar to the original patient while samples with low bioburden yielded less similar infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221565.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). However, the relationship between bioburden and wound similarity is related to the observation that increased bioburden was negatively associated with alpha diversity in patient isolate. This pattern may be driven by species interactions that limit absolute abundances in increasingly complex communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221565.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Furthermore, a similar pattern was recently documented in polymicrobial cystic fibrosis sputum samples where infectious community types were found to have differential bioburden [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]; here the association between bioburden and biodiversity appears novel in the context of wound infection.</p><p>The prior relative abundance in wound inoculate was also found to positively relate to colonization success of individual bacterial species, where species in higher relative abundance were more likely to be detected in the mouse and, of species detected in mice, higher abundance was also found to influence the number of replicate mice in which a species was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221565.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Thus, successful colonization of a given species from patient to mouse was density dependent. However, an exception to this trend was <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> being able to persist and dominate community composition though being detected at low abundances in prior patient samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221565.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221565.s002">S1 Table</xref>). Furthermore, the observed success of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>baumannii</italic> likely reflects a bias for organisms capable of more rapid reproduction, especially in patient to model animal transfer. Overall, community similarity between patient and wound model appears influenced by the presence of fast-growing species, bacterial load, and prior relative abundance.</p><p>While a simplified goal of infecting mice with patient slough may be to re-create <italic>in vivo</italic> communities, prior investigation has shown that chronic wound microbiome communities are intrinsically variable through time [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221565.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Our results clearly demonstrate that transplantation between wounds contributes additional variation, which may be an artifact of three related technical considerations. First, transplanting communities comes with a change in bacterial substrate. In addition to the obvious human to mouse differences mentioned above, physiological dynamics related to wound healing are likely to play a role in species establishment, for which a relatively acute wound and a wound having stalled in healing would hypothetically differ in niche availability [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221565.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Relevant to this study, patients here received treatment in a wound present for at least 30 days, while the mice were sampled at four days post-wounding. Indeed, these effects were reduced from mouse to mouse transplant and more successful microbiome transfers may be achieved by only transferring between same-species hosts. Second, environmental filters that were present in the patient wound were not present in the mouse wound. Patients receiving treatment were also receiving antibiotics, which is known to act as a selective force on microbial communities. The third point relates to community succession since multi-species biofilm development has been previously noted to be dependent on the initial adherence of primary colonizers, who then recruit other species that benefit from positive interspecies dynamics [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Results suggest that the well-documented pathogen, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221565.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221565.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221565.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], may act in a similar capacity in chronic wounds, but is also capable of dominating community structure at later time points [<xref rid="pone.0221565.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thus, the proportional re-establishment of complex wound communities in mouse models is expected to be influenced by the processes described above.</p><p>In conclusion, cryogenic preservation methods evaluated were overall not found to significantly influence community composition and the resulting communities were modeled after their previous community assemblage, though to varying degrees. Change induced in the transplanted microbiota was most significantly an effect of the transplantation process itself, and not cryogenic preservation. However, improved <italic>in vivo</italic> modeling via slough transfer may be further developed by recapitulating patient comorbidities such as diabetes in mice, administering therapeutics to mimic the selective environment of therapy or by repeated inoculation of wounds. A final implication of this study is that microbiome communities can be split into biological replicates and moved from mouse to mouse in a semi-controlled manner. The practicality of this method would then allow for studying polymicrobial communities in response to different environmental stressors through time, thereby providing a method to separate intrinsic microbiome variation from extrinsic treatment effects. Overall, cryogenic preservation and biofilm archives provide opportunities to enhance the study of polymicrobial infection dynamics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0221565.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Rarefaction survey of wound microbiomes.</title><p>(PNG)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0221565.s001.png"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0221565.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Species observed in patient wounds summarized by patient of origin, subsequent detection, relative abundance in patient and phenotypic characteristics.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0221565.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the Southwest Regional Wound Care Center and the Natural Science Research Laboratory at TTU for their support and technical assistance, Dr. Jeremy Wilkinson for procedural insight and Oscar Sandate for statistical programming assistance.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0221565.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Driver</surname><given-names>VR</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Fabbi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lavery</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gibbons</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>. <article-title>The costs of diabetic foot: the economic case for the limb salvage team</article-title>. <source>J Vasc Surg</source>. <year>2010</year>;<volume>52</volume>(<issue>3 Suppl</issue>):<fpage>17S</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>22S</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.jvs.2010.06.003</pub-id> .<?supplied-pmid 20804928?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20804928</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0221565.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Reiber</surname><given-names>GE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lipsky</surname><given-names>BA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gibbons</surname><given-names>GW</given-names></name>. <article-title>The burden of diabetic foot ulcers</article-title>. <source>Am J Surg</source>. <year>1998</year>;<volume>176</volume>(<issue>2a</issue>):<fpage>5s</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>10s</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0002-9610(98)00181-0</pub-id> WOS:000076412000003.<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9777967</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0221565.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Wolcott</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Cutting</surname><given-names>KF</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Dowd</surname><given-names>SE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Percival</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name>. <article-title>Types of Wounds and Infections</article-title>. <source>Microbiology of Wounds</source>. <year>2010</year>:<fpage>219</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>32</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1201/9781420079944-c7</pub-id> WOS:000281681000008.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0221565.ref004"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Wolcott</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sanford</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gabrilska</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Oates</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wilkinson</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Rumbaugh</surname><given-names>KP</given-names></name>. <article-title>Microbiota is a primary cause of pathogenesis of chronic wounds</article-title>. <source>J Wound Care</source>. <year>2016</year>;<volume>25</volume>(<issue>Sup10</issue>):<fpage>S33</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>S43</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.12968/jowc.2016.25.Sup10.S33</pub-id> .<?supplied-pmid 27681809?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">27681809</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0221565.ref005"><label>5</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Wolcott</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hanson</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Rees</surname><given-names>EJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Koenig</surname><given-names>LD</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Phillips</surname><given-names>CD</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wolcott</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
