Abnormalities, like pneumonia or aberrant growth, reduce production efficiency as it reduces the uniformity and might cause multiple deliveries per batch and pigs delivered with a low meat yield or outside the targeted weight range. Early identification of pigs prone to develop these abnormalities, for example, at the onset of the growing-finishing phase, would help to prevent heterogeneous pens through management interventions. Data about previous production cycles at the farm combined with data from the piglet&#x02019;s own history may help in identifying these abnormalities. The aim of this study, therefore, was to predict at the onset of the growing-finishing phase, that is, at 3 mo in advance, deviant pigs at slaughter with a machine-learning technique called boosted trees. The dataset used was extracted from the farm management system of a research center. It contained over 70,000 records of individual pigs born between 2004 and 2016, including information on, for example, offspring, litter size, transfer dates between production stages, their respective locations within the barns, and individual live-weights at several production stages. Results obtained on an independent test set showed that at a 90% specificity rate, the sensitivity was 16% for low meat percentage, 20% for pneumonia and 36% for low lifetime growth rate. For low lifetime growth rate, this meant an almost three times increase in positive predictive value compared to the current situation. From these results, it was concluded that routine performance information available at the onset of the growing-finishing phase combined with data about previous production cycles formed a moderate base to identify pigs prone to develop pneumonia (AUC &#x0003e; 0.60) and a good base to identify pigs prone to develop growth aberrations (AUC &#x0003e; 0.70) during the growing-finishing phase. The mentioned information, however, was not a sufficient base to identify pigs prone to develop low meat percentage (AUC &#x0003c; 0.60). The shown ability to identify growth aberrations and pneumonia can be considered a good first step towards the development of an early warning system for pigs in the growing-finishing phase.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>boosted trees</kwd><kwd>growth</kwd><kwd>machine learning</kwd><kwd>pig production</kwd><kwd>pneumonia</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animal production is more and more confronted with new challenges. On the one hand, there is the increasing demand for animal protein in the future due to population growth and increase of income. On the other hand, to meet the increasing demand for animal protein, production systems should not compromise health and welfare of livestock and should have a minimum impact on environment and land use. According to <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">FAO (2011)</xref>, these challenges will only be achieved by increasing efficiency of production. Increase of production efficiency is mainly focused on improvement of animal growth preferably on less feed through breeding and optimizing management (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Brameld and Parr, 2016</xref>). Delivery of finisher pigs of about 120 kg live weight to the slaughterhouse takes place at about 5.5 mo of age. In pig production, efficiency is benefiting from uniform growth in pens resulting in single deliveries from a pen of possibly all animals in the targeted weight range (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Patience et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Alfonso et al., 2010</xref>). Abnormalities, like pneumonia, represent a considerable problem for the swine industry primarily due to the reduction of daily weight gain (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Merialdi et al., 2012</xref>). This aberrant growth reduces uniformity and might cause multiple deliveries per batch and pigs delivered with a low meat yield or outside the targeted weight range.</p><p>Identifying signs of emerging production deviations at an early stage, for example, at the onset of the growing-finishing phase, when piglets are about 2 mo of age, would help to prevent heterogeneous pens through management intervention. Prediction of future performance, required to identify early signs of deviations, are traditionally based on early body weight recordings. The prediction models are mainly based on nonlinear regression models (i.e., growth models), which appeared to be good descriptors of the growth, but their predictive power is often limited (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Leen et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, extending prediction models with additional factors, like breed and sex as well as environmental factors that affect future performance (e.g., <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Green and Whittemore, 2005</xref>) is rather complex and requires advanced mathematical modeling.</p><p>Early signs of production deviations might be retrieved from historic data about previous production cycles at the farm or from previous deliveries. These data, however, are often incomplete, especially at individual level. Machine-learning techniques are able to deal with incomplete data, irrelevant input variables and are less vulnerable for assumptions concerning, for example, (co)linearity and distributions than classical regression techniques (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Breiman, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Friedman, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, machine-learning techniques proofed to be competitive in various studies in the animals sciences domain in which future performance was predicted using regression or machine-learning techniques (e.g., <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Roush et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Felipe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Alsahaf et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Alves et al., 2019</xref>). To predict future performance based on the integration of animal and environmental information, sometimes being incomplete and noisy, machine-learning techniques appear to be a valuable and suitable technique. One of the basic and probably most studied machine-learning techniques is decision tree induction (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Witten and Frank, 2005</xref>). The main disadvantage of decisions trees, however, is their inaccuracy. To alleviate this problem, ensemble methods have been developed that can combine multiple models. Examples of ensemble methods include bagging, boosting, and stacking, of which boosting is considered the most powerful (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Witten and Frank, 2005</xref>). Boosting is an iterative method. At each iteration, it puts more emphasis on the instances predicted wrongly in previous iterations, when classification is the aim (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Witten and Frank, 2005</xref>). When evaluated together with other machine-learning techniques, boosted trees are often among the best performing machine-learning methods in different fields (e.g., <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Ahmad et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Knoll et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To demonstrate whether it is possible to predict growth of pigs based on animal and environmental information, the aim of this study was to predict deviant slaughter pigs based on routine data available at the onset of the growing-finishing phase with a machine-learning technique called boosted trees.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Routine data used in this study were acquired from the farm management program of a research farm. Since no animal experiments were performed for this study, approval by an Animal Care and Use Committee was not necessary.</p><sec id="s3"><title>Data Sets</title><p>The Swine Innovation Center &#x0201c;VIC Sterksel&#x0201d; is a research center of Wageningen University and Research, located in Sterksel, the Netherlands. At VIC Sterksel, detailed information of all pigs is recorded in the farm management system, for example, on offspring, litter size, transfer dates between production stages, their respective locations within the barns, and individual live-weights at several production stages. The dataset used for this study was extracted from this farm management system and contained over 70,000 records of individual pigs born between 2004 and 2016. Since the aim was to predict which pigs in a batch, defined as group of piglets starting on the same date in the growing-finishing phase, would grow least or would have the lowest meat percentage, we decided to focus on batches at the start of the growing-finishing phase of at least 100 piglets. Furthermore, only pigs from 2 regular growing-finishing stables that resemble commercial husbandry, were included in the study. This resulted in 325 batches containing 61,041 pigs in total. Based on slaughter data, 3 binary traits at the pig level were defined: 1) pneumonia status; 2) belonging to the 10% animals of a batch with the lowest lifetime growth rate; and 3) belonging to the 10% animals of a batch with the lowest meat percentage. Pneumonia status and meat percentage were based on regular slaughterhouse recordings. Lifetime growth rate was calculated as carcass weight (in kg) divided by age at slaughter (in days).</p><p>The pneumonia prevalence was quite variable over the whole period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). As pneumonia status was a binary variable on animal level, by definition no variation within a year is present. For some years before 2010, the number of nonmissing values was low, which could be caused by incomplete recordings of pneumonia status or only recording positive cases. This could also explain the outlier in 2007. Lifetime growth rate increased over time, while variation was rather constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Meat percentage was rather constant over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Mean pneumonia prevalence per year.

The latter 2 variables were combined to one stating the percentage of males in the litter. The quality of the litter in which a pig was born was described by the mean, standard deviation, and median of the birthweights per litter. The piglets &#x0201c;position&#x0201d; in the litter was described by the quartile of birthweight it belongs to within its litter and by the deviation of the piglet&#x02019;s individual birthweight from the median of the litter.</p><p>Organ and carcass deviations were routinely scored at the slaughter line (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Elbers et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">European Community, 2004</xref>). Organ deviations considered pneumonia and affected livers (light and medium were merged together for the analysis) and carcass deviations considered pleuritis and skin and leg inflammations. Next to these binary variables per slaughtered pig, moving averages were calculated at pen level over the last 5 batches that were raised in that pen.</p><p>Environmental factors such as pen conditions might affect growth. This is a high dimensional factor of which the effect is believed to be concentrated in an underlying (variance-covariance) structure of lower dimension. High dimensionality can result in less stable predictions and to avoid overfitting dimension reduction is often required (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Darnell et al., 2017</xref>). For dimension reduction, we applied a linear mixed model (Proc Mixed, SAS V9.3) to estimate the underlying variance-covariance structure of pen-batch effects on lifetime growth performance. The obtained Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (<bold>BLUP</bold>) of the previous batch in a pen was included as prediction variables for the current batch in that pen. Additionally, the moving average of BLUP-estimates of the last 2 batches in a pen were included.

There are different boosted trees algorithms available, and the Gradient Boosting Machine (<bold>GBM</bold>) offered by the h2o.gbm R package (h2o version 3.22.1.1) is one of them. The GBM was used to predict traits at the onset of the growing-finishing phase. The Gradient Boosting Machine is extensively described by <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Hastie et al. (2009)</xref>. Boosting is a forward learning iterative method. At each iteration, it puts more emphasis on the instances predicted wrongly in previous iterations, when classification is the aim (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Witten and Frank, 2005</xref>). Some default model parameters were adapted, the number of trees (ntrees) was set at 1,000, the maximum number of splits per tree (max_depth) was set at 3, and the learning rate (learn_rate) was set at 0.01, in order to speed up the analysis. The large number of models used to calculate the average performance could compensate for the reduction in number of trees and interaction depth per model. All analyses were performed in RStudio (version 1.1.423 running R version 3.5.0).</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Model Testing</title><p>In order to test the model on independent data, for each batch (<italic>n</italic> = 98) in the years 2013 to 2016, a new model was trained on a training dataset and tested on the batch under consideration (Test<sub>New</sub>).

In our study, the true positives were pigs with pneumonia or pigs belonging to the group with 10% lowest lifetime growth rate or meat percentage. Specificity or true negative rate is the fraction of real negative cases that is predicted to be negative. Sensitivity and specificity could be calculated at all levels of probability thresholds of being positive as produced by the GBM model. The trade-off between sensitivity and specificity could be shown in a receiver operating characteristic (<bold>ROC</bold>) curve, in which sensitivity is plotted against the false-positive rate (1&#x02014;specificity) (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Metz, 1978</xref>). The overall performance of a classifier can be characterized by the area under the ROC curve (AUC) (e.g., <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Hanley and McNeil, 1982</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Detilleux et al., 1999</xref>), and these AUC values were reported. Moreover, as we were not interested in the entire ROC curve, but in selecting a rather small part of approximately 10% of the animals per batch, we also evaluated models on their sensitivity at a fixed specificity of 90%.

<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the average performance from 98 model repetitions of the prediction models for pneumonia, low meat percentage and low lifetime growth rate. Testing on independent data showed that AUC were poor (&#x0003c;0.60) to fairly good (&#x0003e;0.70) for prediction of low meat percentage (0.58), pneumonia (0.64), and low lifetime growth rate (0.73). At a 90% specificity rate, sensitivity was 16, 20, and 36% for low meat percentage, pneumonia, and low lifetime growth rate, respectively. The models for pneumonia and low meat percentage somewhat overfitted on the train set, whereas differences in performance on Test<sub>Train</sub> and Test<sub>New</sub> were rather low. For the best performing model, the one for predicting low lifetime growth rate was least overfit and performed equally well on Test<sub>Train</sub> and Test<sub>New</sub>. Variation in performance, however, was much higher between Test<sub>New</sub> batches (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). This means that, at least on average, the model was able to predict lifetime growth rate of pigs in future batches (Test<sub>New</sub>) as well as it was able to predict lifetime growth rate of pigs in random batches in time (Test<sub>Train</sub>). The performance of the pneumonia model was underestimated, because no performance could be calculated when the real incidence of pneumonia in a batch was zero. These batches, however, could be expected to be more accurately predicted than batches with high incidences of pneumonia. Leaving out performance of batches with high performance lowers the reported average performance in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>.

For that purpose, predictions were made based on performance data of the pigs until start of the growing-finishing phase. The prediction was based only on existing routine data from an experimental farm and no additional data have been collected for this study. The reason for that was 2-fold. A first reason was that we wanted to demonstrate the value of existing information in prediction. Nowadays, the focus in prediction is merely on collecting data using new (sensor) techniques (e.g., <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Ferrari et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Maselyne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Pezzuolo et al., 2018</xref>) and the step to integrate with existing information is often neglected (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Rutten et al., 2013</xref>). According to <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Cornou and Kristensen (2013)</xref>, decision making is based on a combination of observations of the animals and their environment, as well as production results. The added value of new sensor technology or monitoring strategies should be considered in combination with information already available in the daily registrations in the farm management system.</p><p>A second reason concerned the time window of prediction. Most often the time window considered in predicting growth is as short as a week (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2006</xref>) or 1 d (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Roush et al., 2006</xref>). From the information available at the onset of the growing-finishing phase, we wanted to predict the outcome of target traits at moment of slaughter, which is about 3 mo later. This was more challenging and required larger training sets (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Alsahaf et al., 2018</xref>). Permanent environmental effects, that is, farm-specific effects, were considered to be important in the prediction and could be retrieved from historical data of the farm. Therefore, all data stored in the farm management system of VIC Sterksel about previous batches were offered to the machine-learning procedure.</p><p>Machine learning is applied often nowadays, and has shown to be competitive with logistic regression in previously conducted studies within the animal domain (e.g., <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Roush et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Felipe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Alsahaf et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Alves et al., 2019</xref>). To confirm these results with our own data, we also applied logistic regression (using h20.glm) to our data. To enable logistic regression, we first imputed missing values (using mice R-package, version 3.5.0) to create datasets with the same number of records as in the main analyses. Results showed that GBM equaled or slightly outperformed logistic regression for all 3 predictions. The largest difference on Test<sub>New</sub> was for the prediction of pneumonia with an average sensitivity of 21% for GBM and 17% for logistic regression at 90% specificity rate and, respectively, an AUC of 0.65 and 0.60. Second, we excluded records with missing values in any of the prediction variables. This resulted in smaller datasets with up to 44% less records. Again, GBM performed equally or slightly better than logistic regression, although differences were smaller than on the imputed datasets. These results confirmed that, also in our study, GBM is at least competitive with logistic regression. Lastly, we compared GBM results on imputed datasets or datasets without missing values with GBM results on the full datasets (from the main analyses in this study). It appeared that the additional effort of imputing or reducing the dataset did result in consistently better prediction performance, while up to 44% less records received a predicted value when records with missing values were excluded. So, in our study, GBM was competitive with logistic regression, without the necessity of data handling that is required for logistic regression.</p><p>One of the major complicating factors in predicting production performance in pigs is the uncertainty of age at slaughter. Production performance, like slaughter weight and meat percentage, are largely affected by age at slaughter. Age at slaughter is primarily a decision made by the farm manager, who is considering, among others, market prices, contract obligations, and additional management aspects. Management decisions are taken somewhere during the growing-finishing phase and are unknown at moment of prediction. To overcome the influence of decision making on our outcome variable, we decided to predict growth during the growing-finishing phase. Growth rate is less affected by management decisions and was, therefore, expected to be more predictable.</p><p>Environmental conditions at pen, section, or stable level might affect performance and is, therefore, usually included in analysis of field experiments (e.g., <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Rehfeldt et al., 2008</xref>). To account for systematic environmental effects of pen in prediction of the current batch, we have chosen to calculate the average performance of the 5 batches preceding the current batch in the pen and offered that to the machine-learning procedure. In this way, the systematic effect of location could be accounted for in the prediction. From the variable importance metric, it was seen that pneumonia history of a pen was the highest contributor to pneumonia prediction, and meat percentage history of a pen was the second highest contributing variable (together with boar line) to prediction of low meat percentage. Contribution of pen history to prediction of pneumonia might point to systematic less optimal conditions in certain parts of the stable, but the contribution of pen history to meat percentage is less clear, although temperature is known to have some effect on meat percentage (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Arkfeld et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Growth up to the onset of the growing-finishing phase was largely dominating the prediction of low growth as indicated by a variable importance of 0.50. This high importance was in accordance with the strong relationship of early growth to later growth as has been established in various studies (e.g., <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Quiniou et al., 2002</xref>). Additionally, birth weight was a good predictor as well and this corresponded with a reasonable relation of birth weight with growth later in life (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Rehfeldt et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Meat percentage is a trait that shows in general relatively little variation and is, therefore, difficult to predict. In this study, the coefficient of variation was 3.1%, whereas a value of 2% was reported in literature (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Shirali et al., 2017</xref>). According to <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Shirali et al. (2017)</xref>, meat percentage is mainly influenced by genetics, sex, and age at slaughter. Sex indeed had largest variable importance followed by boar line, that is, genetics, which corresponded to the results of <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Calderon Diaz et al. (2017)</xref>. Age at slaughter is highly subject to management decisions, and the dataset did not contain variables that hold information from which moment of delivery could be learnt. Variation in age at slaughter can cause a 1 to 4% difference in meat percentage (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Weatherup et al., 2010</xref>). In planning batches for delivery, the farmer selects pigs based on live weight by visual inspection. Because of the weak relation between live weight and meat percentage, this way of selection does not guarantee that the selected pigs also have optimal meat percentage.</p><p>Quality of predictions is often assessed using ROC curves, being a method that is helpful to visualize the performance of classifiers and describe the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. These curves are particularly useful in areas of cost-sensitive learning and learning in the presence of unbalanced cases (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Fawcett, 2006</xref>). The AUC is often considered as it reflects the expected performance of a classifier irrespective of the chosen threshold, and it indicates the probability that an aberrant animal can be distinguished from a well performing animal. A larger AUC indicates a better average performance, although it might be that another classifier might perform better at specific combinations of sensitivity and specificity.</p><p>Both pneumonia and low growth had an AUC of about 0.70, but sensitivity of pneumonia was higher only at specificity levels of 0.30 and lower. At specificity levels above 0.40, the sensitivity of lifetime growth rate was higher.</p><p>From the results of AUC for the 3 target traits, it became clear that the AUC of low meat percentage was too low to be considered a sufficient prediction and the outcome was hardly any better than random prediction. The recording of performance till the onset of the growing-fattening phase had apparently no predictive power with respect to meat percentage, neither had the pen performance history. For prediction of meat percentage, additional variables should be recorded, for example, related to body composition of the live animal preferably available at moment of prediction or early in the growing-finishing phase.</p><p>The AUC results of pneumonia and low lifetime growth rate were better and were comparable to detection of, for example, lame cows (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Kamphuis et al., 2013</xref>) and predicting of insemination outcomes in dairy cattle using random forest methodology (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Shahinfar et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Intervention requires close monitoring and more intense management which cannot be given to the whole production unit. Therefore, an early indication of pigs at risk to develop an aberration would help the farmer to concentrate on a smaller unit only. For practical applications, the sensitivity is therefore often considered at a fixed specificity. For example, at a 90% specificity rate (i.e., only 10% of false positives are allowed), the sensitivity rates were 20% for pneumonia, 16% for low meat percentage, and 36% for low lifetime growth rate (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). According to <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Kamphuis et al. (2013)</xref>, this would mean that in a stable with 1,000 finishing pigs, 14 (20%) out of the 72 pneumonia cases (i.e., prevalence is 7.2%) will be detected, whereas 93 false alerts out of 928 healthy pigs can be expected. In other words, 107 piglets would receive an indication prior to the growing-finishing phase, of which 14 indeed will develop pneumonia (when no action is taken). For slow growth with a sensitivity of 36% at 90% specificity, 126 piglets would receive an indication at start of the growing-finishing phase of which 36 indeed would grow too slow; 2 out of 7 alerts will be correct. This is almost 3 times increase in success compared to the current situation which has a positive predicted value, equivalent to prevalence, of 10%. This result was achieved using only routinely collected data from an experimental farm. Results, thus, can be considered as a first step towards an early warning system for slow growing pigs and development of pneumonia.</p></sec><sec id="s13"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Routine performance information available at the onset of the growing-finishing phase combined with data about previous production cycles formed a moderate base to identify pigs prone to develop pneumonia (AUC &#x0003e; 0.60) and a good base to identify pigs prone to develop growth aberrations (AUC &#x0003e; 0.70) during the growing-finishing phase. The mentioned information, however, was not a sufficient base to identify pigs prone to develop low meat percentage (AUC &#x0003c; 0.60).The shown ability to identify growth aberrations and pneumonia can be considered a good first step towards the development of an early warning system for pigs in the growing-finishing phase.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="a1"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Swine Innovation Center &#x0201c;VIC Sterksel,&#x0201d; the Netherlands, and especially Gisabeth Binnendijk, for supplying the data and sharing valuable information and comments on the results.
