A major enhancement of Golden Gate assembly is represented by the Modular Cloning (MoClo) system that allows for simple library propagation and combinatorial construction of genetic circuits from reusable parts. Yet, one limitation of the MoClo system is that all circuits are assembled in low- and medium copy plasmids, while a rapid route to chromosomal integration is lacking. To overcome this bottleneck, here we took advantage of the conditional-replication, integration, and modular (CRIM) plasmids, which can be integrated in single copies into the chromosome of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and related bacteria by site-specific recombination at different phage attachment (<italic>att</italic>) sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">By combining the modularity of the MoClo system with the CRIM plasmids features we created a set of 32 novel CRIMoClo plasmids and benchmarked their suitability for synthetic biology applications.

For instance, the expression of synthetic circuits from medium- or high-copy plasmids in <italic>E. coli</italic> can lead to toxic side effects on the chassis cell, as being the result, e.g., of competition for essential cellular resources, such as metabolites, RNA polymerase or ribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus, reducing such undesired cross-reactions with the host are among the key factors for the success of a rational, model-driven design of novel synthetic circuits. While this has led to the development of a number of orthogonal (i.e. context independent) regulators for synthetic circuit construction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], high plasmid copy numbers can still generate growth defects, as e.g. in the case of the expression of membrane-anchored anti-&#x003c3; factors regulating the activity of orthogonal extracytoplasmic function (ECF) &#x003c3; factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Besides approaches for reducing toxicity, synthetic biology relies on a comprehensive set of modular and well-characterized DNA parts as well as modular cloning strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Currently, there are several DNA assembly methods used across the synthetic biology community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] that are based on Gibson Assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], Ligase Cycling Reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], Gateway cloning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and Golden Gate cloning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. With these methodologies, DNA parts such as promoters, coding sequences, and terminators are assembled to build functional transcription units that can then be combined in more complex genetic circuits. Among them, Golden Gate cloning is based on Type IIS restriction digestion and ligation, and allows for cloning of multiple genetic parts in a one-tube reaction. A major innovation of the original Golden Gate assembly framework came with the development of the Modular Cloning (MoClo) system that enables not only hierarchical construction of multigene constructs but also full reusability of parts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The MoClo system provides a series of vectors that are organized within different levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). A specific antibiotic cassette and the positioning of the two different Type IIS restriction sites, that generate pre-defined 4 base pair (bp) overhangs (fusion sites), define the level of each vector. The fusions sites allow for directional cloning of multiple genetic parts, hence enabling hierarchical assembly of transcription units and genetic circuits with increasing complexity through the different levels. Simple library preparation and combinatorial assembly from reusable parts make the MoClo system a valuable tool for synthetic biology applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, even though the system permits complex genetic circuit generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], to date most circuits are assembled on low- or medium-copy plasmids. When studying complex genetic circuits or biosynthetic pathways this may lead to overproduction of proteins, which can generate adverse effects on growth and stress responses that are not present at lower levels of expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Also, while low-copy plasmids may circumvent issues with protein overexpression, plasmid stability is only guaranteed under permanent antibiotic selection, which can also have negative effects on cell growth and physiology.

The design of CRIMoClo plasmids allows for a seamless transition between the two systems</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13036_2019_218_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par6">To circumvent these issues, different methods for integrating DNA from plasmids into the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome have been developed. For instance, recombineering-based strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], such as KIKO vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], facilitate the integration of large circuits in <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, these strategies often rely on traditional restriction digestion and ligation, which limit the speed of circuit construction and do not allow for recycling of genetic parts. Recently, an innovation was developed by Schindler et al., providing a series of MoClo-compatible vectors that facilitate lambda Red-based integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, recombineering-based strategies tend to suffer from another limitation, which is the lack of well-characterized orthogonal loci. For instance, it was shown that protein expression and metabolite production in <italic>E. coli</italic> may be influenced by the location of their integrations sites on the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and even though five novel open reading frames were identified as suitable integration loci for synthetic circuits in <italic>E. coli</italic>, the integration efficiency and expression of genetic constructs in these loci varied significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">An alternative way to perform chromosomal integrations is based on bacteriophage integrases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A prime example embarking on this strategy is implemented in the &#x0201c;conditional-replication, integration, and modular&#x0201d; (CRIM)-based plasmids, which carry different phage attachment (<italic>attP</italic>) sites and can be used to insert large DNA fragments at bacterial phage-attachment (<italic>attB</italic>) sites (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The site-specific recombination is driven via expression of phage-derived integrase (<italic>int</italic>) gene encoded on a helper plasmid. The integration procedure is simple, requiring only the co-transformation of the bacterial strain with a CRIM plasmid, together the cognate helper plasmid, and a temperature shift that induces expression of the integrase. Since the helper plasmid is temperature sensitive for replication, the integration of the CRIM and the cure of the helper plasmid occur simultaneously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Moreover, CRIM plasmids possess the &#x003b3; conditional origin of replication of R6K that depends on the trans-acting &#x003c0; protein (encoded by <italic>pir</italic>) for replication. Hence, successful integration events can easily be selected by transforming a <italic>pir</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> host with CRIM plasmids under antibiotic selection. These characteristics make CRIM plasmids a fast and reliable strategy for chromosomal integration in <italic>E. coli,</italic> and even though the system was further improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], so far CRIM-based integration methods lacked standardization, limiting the speed of DNA assembly/integration and not enabling for the reusability of genetic parts.</p><p id="Par8">To fill this gap here we combine the standardization and modularity of the MoClo system, with the high integration efficiency of CRIM plasmids, generating a set of CRIMoClo plasmids (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). We benchmark their suitability for synthetic biology approaches assembling synthetic circuits from reusable Level 0 parts and showing the orthogonality of the four phage attachment sites and four different resistance cassettes. Further, we present a strategy that facilitates the sequential integration of different inducible reporter systems at the four phage attachment sites, showing the modularity and the efficiency of the framework. Finally, we use our fast and reliable assembly/integration strategy to perform a large multi-part assembly (&#x0223c;10&#x02009;kb) and integration of synthetic ECF-&#x003c3;/anti-&#x003c3; switches, showing that growth defects observed for circuits encoded on medium-copy plasmids are abolished.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="Par9">The design of CRIMoClo plasmids aims to combine the combinatorial features of MoClo vectors with the reliable and highly efficient chromosomal integration of CRIM plasmids. As illustrated previously, the MoClo system provides a series of vectors that are organized in different levels defined by a specific resistance cassette and different 4&#x02009;nt overhangs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). The properties of the MoClo system support for easy generation of a library of genetic parts that, upon PCR amplification, can be cloned in Level 0 vectors. Conforming to the characteristic of the MoClo vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], up to 8 Level 0 parts can be assembled in Level 1 vectors to generate functional transcription units (TUs). Up to six TUs can be combined from Level 1 to Level M, and from Level M to Level P. The system consents also a continuous assembly of parts from Level P to Level M and vice versa. Since our and other publicly available MoClo multipart libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] provide genetic parts stored in Level 0 and Level 1 vectors, we generated CRIMoClo plasmids possessing Level M (pAGM8031) and Level P (pICH75322) cloning sites (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). This permits not only the use of CRIMoClo plasmids as integrative vectors but also as MoClo vectors, providing a seamless transition between the two systems (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Within the Level M and P cloning sites we also maintained the <italic>lacZ&#x003b1;</italic> fragment coding region from <italic>E. coli</italic> for blue/white selection and added a high copy number origin of replication (ColE1) derived from MoClo vector pICH82094 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). CRIMoClo plasmids also possess the &#x003b3; conditional origin of replication of R6K, which requires the <italic>trans</italic>-acting &#x003c0; protein (encoded by <italic>pir</italic>) for replication, allowing them to replicate at a medium (15 per cell) plasmid copy number in <italic>pir</italic><sup>+</sup>
<italic>E. coli</italic> hosts, but not in normal (non-<italic>pir</italic>) hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The coexistence of ColE1 and R6K origins of replication did not affect the stability of the plasmids and permits propagation of the CRIMoClo vectors at high copy number before cloning a construct (relying on ColE1), and their conversion into suicide vectors after cloning (relying on R6K). This in turn enables efficient chromosomal integration of the CRIMoClo plasmids in non-<italic>pir</italic> hosts (see below). To insulate the insert from transcriptional read-through, in our design the MoClo cloning module is flanked by bacterial (<italic>rgnB</italic>) and phage &#x003bb; (tL3) terminators (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Last, each CRIMoClo vector exists in four variants that differ in the selectable resistance markers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a), supporting high flexibility while maintaining the capability of switching between Level M and Level P.
<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Blueprint of CRIMoClo plasmids. Each plasmid has a MoClo-compatible cloning cassette (purple box), flanked by two terminators (<italic>rgnB</italic> and <italic>tL3</italic> depicted in grey) and followed by a selectable resistance marker (orange arrows), a &#x003b3; conditional-replication origin (grey box), both enclosed between two FRT sites (grey arrows).

The chromosomal integration into one of the <italic>attB</italic> sites follows the same strategy of CRIM plasmids (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b), where a non-<italic>pir E. coli</italic> strain carrying a CRIM helper plasmid (expressing the recombinase specific to the integration into the respective chromosomal&#x000a0;<italic>attB</italic> site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]) is transformed with the CRIMoClo-based plasmid. Alternatively, CRIMoClo and helper plasmids can be efficiently co-transformed (see results below) using the transformation and storage solution (TSS) technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Independent of the preferred strategy, expression of the integrase gene encoded in the helper plasmids is induced at elevated temperatures during the transformation procedure (see Material and Methods), and since the helper plasmids are temperature-sensitive for replication, integration and curing of the helper plasmid occur in the same incubation step (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Single integration events can be then screened by colony PCR with four primers (P1-P2-P3-P4; see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) that enable the distinction between single, multiple, and no integration events. Like the original CRIM plasmids, CRIMoClo plasmids can also be excised efficiently from the chromosome by another round of helper plasmid transformation and <italic>excisionase</italic> (Xis) expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

In theory, this now enables&#x000a0;efficient assembly and chromosomal integration of synthetic genetic circuits in only 4 days, starting from Level 1 transcription units (see below). Moreover, the availability of each plasmid with one of four resistance cassettes should allow, in principle, sequential integration in different <italic>att</italic> sites without the necessity of recombining the resistance cassette after each integration step.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Insulation and robustness of gene expression at <italic>attB</italic> sites</title><p id="Par12">To demonstrate the versatility of CRIMoClo plasmids for synthetic biology applications, we evaluated the modularity of chromosomal integration into the four <italic>attB</italic> sites.

The position of the integration sites (<italic>attB</italic>) in the chromosome of <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113 (the closest parental strain of our reporter strain (SV01) with an annotated genome) is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b. Since essential chromosomal genes lie between the different integration sites and since all CRIMoClo plasmids are integrated into the same relative orientation, recombination among them does not lead to genome instability, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and also demonstrated further in this work. In order to evaluate gene expression from constructs integrated into the four <italic>attB</italic> sites, we used a reporter construct that we previously generated in our laboratory using MoClo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). This construct consists of an arabinose-inducible promoter P<sub><italic>BAD</italic></sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] in combination with its regulatory protein (AraC) encoded in divergent orientation, fused to the luciferase cassette from <italic>Photorhabdus luminescens</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], using a strong ribosome binding sequence (st8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]) and a strong synthetic terminator (L3S2P21) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The transcription unit encoded on MoClo Level 1 vector was sub-cloned in all 16 CRIMoClo Level M plasmids (all combinations of four selected <italic>att</italic> sites and four antibiotic selection markers) simultaneously in 1&#x02009;day. On day 2 we verified the constructs by colony PCR and started overnight cultures. On day 3 we isolated the plasmids, verified them by restriction digestion and integrated them in the four different phage attachment sites (<italic>att</italic><sub>HK022</sub>, <italic>att</italic><sub>P21</sub>, <italic>att</italic><sub>&#x003d5;80</sub>, <italic>att</italic><sub>&#x003bb;</sub>) of <italic>E. coli</italic> strain SV01.

On day 4 we tested the clones with colony PCR (see Material and Methods) and strikingly, single integration events showed a success rate of 97% (calculated as average of positive clones screened by colony PCR) for all selected <italic>att</italic> sites and selection markers combined. The expression of the luciferase cassette, which has proven to be a highly sensitive reporter system for in vivo gene expression analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], was benchmarked by growing strains in defined minimal media (doubling time &#x0223c;175&#x02009;min) and assaying luciferase activity continuously for 8&#x02009;h after the addition of the inducer (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). We found that in all integration loci the luciferase signal was not detectable in the absence of the inducer, while after induction, the luciferase operon was expressed from all promoters (&#x0223c;10,000- to 100,000-fold over empty vector control depending on the inducer levels). Strikingly, in all integration loci, the expression dynamics (corresponding to different inducer levels) of the luciferase reporter construct was almost identical.

To demonstrate this we sequentially integrated four different reporter cassettes into the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome<italic>,</italic> without removing the selectable marker after each integration step. The novel transcription units were built using previously generated genetic parts (inducible P<sub><italic>BAD</italic></sub> promoter, st8 ribosome binding sequence, and L3S2P21 terminator) fused with different reporter genes (<italic>gfp</italic>, <italic>mCherry, mTurquoise</italic>).

Subsequently, for each strain we integrated P<sub><italic>BAD</italic></sub>-<italic>gfp</italic> in the next available locus, following the above-mentioned order (<italic>att</italic><sub>HK022,</sub>
<italic>att</italic><sub>P21,</sub>
<italic>att</italic><sub>&#x003d5;80,</sub> and <italic>att</italic><sub>&#x003bb;</sub>), as described in Methods and shown in the lower panel of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. The newly generated double integration strains were then used for the integration of P<sub><italic>BAD</italic></sub>-<italic>mCherry</italic> in the next free <italic>att</italic> site (triple integrations) and subsequently of P<sub><italic>BAD</italic></sub>-<italic>mTurquoise</italic> in the last available <italic>att</italic> site (quadruple integrations). As a positive control for the expression levels of the fluorescence reporters in the newly generated strains, we also assembled and integrated each reporter construct (P<sub><italic>BAD</italic></sub>-<italic>gfp,</italic> P<sub><italic>BAD</italic></sub>-<italic>mCherry,</italic> P<sub><italic>BAD</italic></sub>-<italic>mTurquoise</italic>) into each of the four <italic>att</italic> sites alone. All the strains were monitored within time course experiments for OD and the four reporter activities (in case of multi-integration, also in the intermediate strains containing only one, two, or three reporter constructs) in presence and absence of the inducer (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S7-S11). The histogram in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows the dynamic range (reporter signal of induced strain, divided by reporter signal of uninduced strain), measured after 10&#x02009;h, of all single integrant strains in comparison with strains generated with single, double, triple or quadruple integration events. Overall, we found that all the transcription units were functional after the integration (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The luciferase construct showed the highest dynamic range (&#x0223c;3.2&#x000b7;10<sup>4</sup>-fold induction), consistent with the fact that the reporter is based on an enzymatic reaction with virtually no background activity. This dynamic range is then followed by mCherry (&#x0223c;2.4&#x000b7;10<sup>3</sup>-fold induction), GFP (&#x0223c;7.6-fold induction) and mTurquoise (&#x0223c;1.5-fold induction). Here, the lower dynamic range observed for GFP compared to the mCherry reporter is likely due to green autofluorescence of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells caused by the excretion of flavins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], thereby reducing the signal-to-noise ratio for this reporter. Likewise, mTurquoise has been reported to feature a long maturation time of 112&#x02009;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], which can also reduce the apparent output dynamic range of this reporter. Independent of these reporter-specific dynamic ranges, we found little cross-talk among the reporters, as indicated by the fact that single, double, and triple integration strains showed only significant activity in the reporters that were present in the respective strains. Strikingly, the dynamic range values for single integrant strains are identical (within the error tolerance) to the ones calculated for single, double, triple, and quadruple integration strains (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), showing that the sequential integration of each reporter construct does not affect the expression level of the previously integrated ones. Also, the simultaneous presence of multiple copies of P<sub><italic>BAD</italic></sub> in the same strain does not lead to instability or change in the reporter expression levels, suggesting that the potential recombination among the loci does not occur. Overall, these results show that the multi-integration strategy using CRIMoClo plasmids is highly flexible and does not require time-consuming removal of resistance cassettes after the individual integration steps.

Hence, lowering the copy number of the construct using low copy number plasmids or via chromosomal integration is often a solution. Yet, the size of the genetic circuits can often limit the efficiency of chromosomal integration and even though there are strategies that facilitate the integration of large genetic circuits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], they generally do not support easy, modular circuit generation.</p><p id="Par20">Previously we used a MoClo-based strategy to build synthetic timer circuits based on alternative, extracytoplasmic function (ECF) &#x003c3; factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

In order to improve the dynamic response of our ECF-based circuits here we wanted to introduce anti-&#x003c3; (AS) factors that inactivate ECFs by sequestration and thereby can lead to a more clear-cut switching from the off- to the on-state of an ECF switch. However, AS factors are often transmembrane proteins that can become toxic when expressed at a high level in <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Being aware of this possible issue and in order to use AS factors in our genetic circuits, we wanted to benchmark their toxicity as well as their ability to sequester the cognate ECF &#x003c3; factor. To do so, we wanted to compare toxicity and functionality of the same AS-based circuits encoded on medium copy number plasmids or chromosomally integrated. Hence, we used the medium copy number MoClo compatible vector pSVM-mc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and CRIMoClo plasmids as destination vectors to assemble 11 ECF-&#x003c3;/anti-&#x003c3; switches (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a,f). All switches include two inducible promoters, P<sub><italic>BAD</italic></sub> and P<sub><italic>tet</italic></sub>, controlling the expression of an ECF &#x003c3; factor and its cognate AS, respectively. Moreover, the relative ECF target promoter is fused to a luciferase cassette, used to assay ECF &#x003c3; factor activity. Using the MoClo we successfully assembled 22 circuits in parallel (11 ECF &#x003c3;/anti-&#x003c3; switches on medium copy number MoClo vector and CRIMoClo <italic>att</italic><sub>HK022</sub>) and even though the size of these circuits is &#x0223c;10&#x02009;kb, overall, we observed a high chromosomal integration efficiency (all clones were positive when one per construct was tested via colony PCR and restriction digestion). Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> shows the functionality and toxicity effect of two ECF &#x003c3;/anti-&#x003c3; switches in detail. In our previous analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] we observed that for these particular ECFs, the basal activity of the P<sub><italic>BAD</italic></sub> promoter is sufficient to produce a number of ECFs that activate their target promoter, resulting in significant luciferase activity on a medium copy plasmid (&#x0003e;&#x02009;10,000-fold over background). Thus, in order to avoid oversaturation of the cell with ECFs, we relied on this basal activity of the P<sub><italic>BAD</italic></sub> promoter of ECF expression, assaying the luciferase signal from the ECF target promoter for 8&#x02009;h and inducing AS expression after 2&#x02009;h from the beginning of the measurement (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In plasmid-encoded circuits, we observed a decrease of the luciferase signal (80-fold for AS16, Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b; 160-fold for AS22, Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>g) in both AS-switches, suggesting that in both cases AS factors bind the cognate ECF &#x003c3; factor and thereby lower the target promoter activity. However, upon the production of the AS factor, in both circuits we also noted a marked decrease in the OD<sub>600</sub> values (5-fold when compared to the uninduced strain; Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d,i). Hence, the induction of these AS factors, when encoded on medium copy number plasmids, lead to toxic effects on the cells. Therefore, it is not possible to discriminate if the reduction of luciferase signal is due to the inhibiting activity of the AS on the ECF &#x003c3; factor, or to the AS overexpression that causes a growth defect in the strain analyzed. However, when examining the same ECF &#x003c3;/AS circuits integrated into the chromosome, we also observed a significant decrease in the luciferase signal (30-fold for AS16, Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c; 150-fold for AS22, Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>h), while showing almost identical OD<sub>600</sub> values of AS-induced and uninduced cultures (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>e,l). These results suggest that in both chromosomally integrated circuits, the AS factors retained their ability to sequester the cognate ECF &#x003c3; factor, while the toxicity effects observed on medium copy number plasmids were completely abolished. Therefore, we conclude that for these particular AS factor-based circuits, the chromosomal integration represents the optimal configuration to modulate the behavior of ECF-&#x003c3; switches, while keeping the cells viable. Our experiments also showed that it is possible to use CRIMoClo plasmid to efficiently generate and integrate multiple large constructs (&#x0223c;10&#x02009;kb) in parallel, starting from MoClo library parts. Finally, since CRIMoClo plasmids are fully compatible with the MoClo standard, it is possible to easily generate, test and compare the same genetic circuit in a plasmid, or chromosomal configuration.

In such pathways, optimizing the balance in production of different pathway components is often a key step to reach the desired output product. To do so, one of the strategies consists in adjusting the transcription and the translation rate of each gene in the pathway. Using a combinatorial framework like the MoClo system allows for the generation of a library of interchangeable parts (such as promoters, ribosome binding sites, and transcriptional regulators), that can be combined in several permutations in order to find the right balance of gene expression levels that feature functional synthetic circuit activity. With the aim of increasing the spectrum of possible permutations in synthetic circuit generation, the CRIMoClo system designed here represents an additional degree of freedom to the possible configurations of a given synthetic circuit. In particular, the system supports the generation of genetic circuits from reusable, MoClo-compatible parts and their integration into 4 orthogonal <italic>att</italic> sites in the genome of <italic>E. coli.</italic> By combining the properties of the CRIM plasmids with those of the MoClo system, the framework allows for easy generation and rapid integration of large synthetic constructs. In the present work we have assembled and integrated constructs up to ~&#x02009;10&#x02009;kb with high efficiency. Given that under natural conditions the recombination machinery is capable of integrating typical phage genomes of ~&#x02009;50&#x02009;kb, the manipulation and integration of larger synthetic circuits should, in principle, be possible. However, at such sizes a finite plasmid stability and other factors might limit transformation and thus integration efficiency, and further studies are required to probe the upper limits of the approach.</p><p id="Par22">Utilizing four different resistance modules, CRIMoClo system facilitates fast and reliable multiple integrations. Moreover, the modular design of CRIMoClo plasmids allows for an easy, further expansion of the system for compatibility with other Modular Cloning-based frameworks, such as CIDAR MoClo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], Start-Stop Assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], Loop Assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and Mobius Assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. With these features the CRIMoClo system brings the combinatorial assembly to the next step, enabling a seamless transition between plasmid-encoded and chromosomally integrated genetic circuits. Finally, with the CRIMoClo system, it is possible to generate and simultaneously utilize a combination of plasmid-borne and chromosomally integrated genetic modules. Therefore, when used together, the different gene copy numbers implemented in the MoClo and CRIMoClo systems enable adjustment of gene expression levels over wide ranges, thereby facilitating, e.g., the optimization of enzyme expression levels in a biosynthetic pathway in order to maximize downstream product formation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p id="Par23"><italic>E. coli</italic> strains used in this study are listed in Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1.

The generated fragments were fused via Gibson Assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], setting a reaction in which 50&#x02009;ng of backbone DNA (0.03&#x02009;pmol) were mixed with 0.09&#x02009;pmol of insert (represented by the resistance cassette) and Gibson Reaction Mix (New England Biolabs) in a final volume of 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;l. The Gibson Assembly was performed for 1&#x02009;h at 50&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The resulting plasmids were then used as templates to generate eight gentamicin and eight spectinomycin resistant CRIMoClo plasmids, using Gibson Assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In particular, the backbones pSV125, pSV126, pSV127, pSV128, pSV219, pSV220, pSV221 and pSV222 were PCR amplified using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA and the primers GF0945/GF0532 in order to maintain the promoter of the kanamycin cassette.
