This system has been adopted for numerous genome engineering applications in research and recently, therapeutics. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been largely implemented by delivery of Cas9 as protein, RNA, or plasmid along with a chimeric crRNA-tracrRNA guide RNA (gRNA) under the expression of a pol III promoter, such as U6. Using this approach, multiplex genome engineering has been achieved by delivering several U6-gRNA plasmids targeting multiple loci. However, this approach is limited due to the efficiently of delivering multiple plasmids to a single cell at one time. To augment the capability and accessibility of multiplexed genome engineering, we developed an efficient golden gate based method to assemble gRNAs linked by optimal <italic>Csy4</italic> ribonuclease sequences to deliver up to 10 gRNAs as a single gRNA array transcript. Here we report the optimal expression of our guide RNA array under a strong pol II promoter. This system can be implemented alongside the myriad of CRISPR applications, allowing users to model complex biological processes requiring numerous gRNAs.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Zach Sobiech Osteosarcoma Fund</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moriarity</surname><given-names>Branden S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>The Children&#x02019;s Cancer Research Fund</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moriarity</surname><given-names>Branden S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>National Cancer Institute grant</institution></funding-source><award-id>R03 1R03CA201502-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moriarity</surname><given-names>Branden S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Sobiech Osteosarcoma Fund Award; the Children&#x02019;s Cancer Research Fund; National Cancer Institute grant R03 1R03CA201502-01.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>With advances in our understanding of complex biological processes, such as cancer development and transdifferentiation, the need to readily model and manipulate these complex systems is ever increasing. Being able to <underline>modulate</underline> multiple genes of the same pathway or separate pathways at one time, will help further our understanding of polygenic functional outcomes. The CRISPR (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) and CRISPR associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system has become a powerful tool for modifying gene expression and function. In prokaryotes the CRISPR/Cas system functions as an adaptive immune system via targeted disruption of invading phages [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. There are three major types of CRISPR/Cas9 systems which differ in the processes used to disrupt phages [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In Type I CRISPR systems, the Cas operon consists of variable CRISPR RNA (crRNA) sequences in series with intermittent endoribonuclease spacer motifs, such as Csy4 spacer motifs [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. When transactivated, multiple crRNAs are transcribed in tandem and cleaved into individual pre-crRNAs by Csy4 [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Individual pre-cRNAs then associate with the Cascade complex and Cas3 to form an active nuclease complex, which is guided to the target phage dsDNA base on the complementarity with the crRNA where it induces a double stranded break [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In Type II CRISPR systems, multiple crRNAs are also transcribed in tandem and then cleaved, but in contrast the individual pre-crRNAs associate with Cas9 and an invariable tracrRNA. RNase III is then recruited to this complex where it trims the RNA heteroduplex and forms a mature ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. At the 5&#x02019; end of the Type II crRNAs is the 20 nt protospacer region which hybridizes directs RNP to a target DNA sequence where it induces a double stranded break (DSB) [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In synthetic gene editing, the crRNA and tracrRNA can be fused into a single chimeric gRNA (sgRNA or gRNA) that can be cloned into an expression vector without requirements of post-transcriptional modification [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Together, introduction a of a sgRNA alongside a Cas9 expression vector is a simple and elegant method for targeted DSB induction.</p><p>CRISPR/Cas9 has now been coopted by numerous laboratories for various genome engineering purposes. Cas9-sgRNA induced DSBs can be utilized for gene knockout via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair or sequence modification through homology directed repair (HDR) using a donor DNA substrate [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, many groups have utilized the nuclease dead Cas9 (dCas9) mutant for transcriptional activation (VP64, MS2:p65:HSF1, and p300 fusions) [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and repression (KRAB fusion) [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] by directly fusing the heterologous domains to dCas9 or localizing them using the MS2 RNA binding protein in conjunction with a modified gRNA architecture containing MS2 binding sites.</p><p>The ability to deliver multiple gRNAs simultaneously makes CRISPR/Cas9 system highly amenable to multiplex genome editing. Previously, this was achieved by delivering multiple plasmids encoding gRNAs expressed from the strong U6 pol III promoter targeting several different genes. However, this becomes troublesome due to the poor efficiency and toxicity associated with delivering large amounts of plasmid DNA to cells. An alternative approach is to deliver the gRNAs as <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed (IVT) RNAs [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or chemically synthesized RNA oligonucleotides [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] alongside Cas9 protein. However, for basic research this approach becomes cost prohibitive and is largely reserved for use in sensitive applications such as gene editing primary cell types which do not tolerate transfection with plasmid dsDNA. In light of this, a number of groups have generated methods to clone multiple pol III promoter:gRNA elements into a single plasmid in tandem [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] or alternating the orientation array format [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Although these methods are minimally functional, there are drawbacks to these approaches. For instance, multiple groups have raised the concern that numerous pol III promoters may engage in &#x0201c;Promoter Cross talk Effects&#x0201d; and reduce the transcriptional activity of endogenous pol III driven genes, potentially causing undesirable side effects [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Further, as these systems have largely been validated via transient transfection, there may be a large amount of promoter interface when stably integrated, as has been reported using arrays of pol II driven elements [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], potentially limiting their utility for stable CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene activation or repression.</p><p>Inspired by the endogenous CRISPR system, herein we describe methods for highly efficient assembly and expression of CRISPR/Cas9 gRNA arrays using golden gate assembly methods and pol II promoters [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We validated the system using gRNA array vectors containing up to ten unique gRNAs in human cells through transient expression for gene knockout and activation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Design and construction of gRNAs</title><p>A detailed protocol for the design and construction of guide RNA (gRNA) arrays is found in supplementary protocol 1, alongside ApE plasmid maps in supplementary files 1. gRNAs were designed to the desired region of each target gene using the CRISPR Design Program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crispr.mit.edu/">http://crispr.mit.edu</ext-link>).

The ligation was incubated at room temperature for at least 1 hour and then transformed and mini-prepped using the GeneJET Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

We hypothesized that the use of the canonical U6 driven expression of the highly repetitive array may produce low abundance of the gRNA array transcript for two main reasons. Firstly, the lack of a polyA tract and G cap associated with pol III driven genes may reduce the stability of the transcript to RNAses, and secondly pol III promoters typically express shorter transcripts (~100&#x02013;500 nt) such as tRNAs, 5S rRNAs or miRNAs, which might limit the expression of an entire array of 10 gRNAs in tandem [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

Although the proof of multiple gene modifications in individual clones was not demonstrated in this manuscript, our gRNA arrays did effectively induce high rates of gene editing at all gRNA target sites in a population when expressed from the strong pol II CAG promoter containing a polyadenylation sequence. To assess rates of multiple modifications at the single cell level, future work could employ multiparametered flow cytometry to determine the proportion of cells that are simultaneously edited or induced for all genes in the gRNA array.</p><p>One potential drawback to the use of gRNA arrays is that there repetitive nature poses the risk of recombination if stably integrated in long term culture for applications such as CRISPR-imaging [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our work here did not employ the integration of a gRNA array cassette in mammalian cells, however we did not experience any issue with reliably cloning these vectors in bacterial cells (Panel A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0198714.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), which is minimally suggestive of their stability against stochastic recombination. Gene editing frequencies are higher when using pol II driven gRNA arrays compared to the individual standard U6-gRNA plasmids, especially when multiplexing numerous U6-gRNA plasmids. One of the more unexpected results of our study was that the use of the pol II CAG promoter optimally expressed the gRNA array, in that it resulted in higher gene editing frequencies compared to individual U6-gRNAs plasmids, which is the most commonly used format of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. This is unexpected as the U6 promoter has been shown to be highly efficient at transcription of gRNAs with nearly a log fold higher expression compared to CMV for instance [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although the CAG promoter may simply produce larger amounts of transcript compared to the standard U6 promoter, another potential reason for enhanced editing may be due to the use the Csy4 enzyme. While we did not explicitly demonstrate that Csy4 completely cleaves the gRNA array transcript in the cell, our data demonstrates the necessity of Csy4 for the induction of multiplex editing from the gRNA array (Panel A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0198714.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, perhaps Csy4 protects the gRNA from degradation that normally occurs from endogenous non-specific RNases, providing a larger window of time for Cas9 to bind the gRNA and induce targeted DSBs. Future studies investigating the mechanism of Csy4 array processing and conceivable interaction with Cas9 will be required to identify any potential mechanism of enhancement of the system.</p><p>Since its discovery the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been rapidly adopted for numerous applications due to its ease of use, specificity, and the seemingly limitless ability to maintain function when fused to various protein domains. However, some of the applications, such as chromosome labeling and genetic circuits, require the use of numerous gRNAs at one time. For instance, Chen et al. found that labeling unique genomic regions using the dCas9-EGFP fusion required 26&#x02013;36 gRNAs to obtain a signal to noise ratio allowing the region to be visible by microscopy [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Chen et al. achieved stable expression of gRNAs by packaging each gRNA in individual lentiviral vectors and transducing target cells with the pooled lentiviral vectors. There have also been a number of publications using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate genetic circuits, though only a few gRNAs are typically utilized and at maximum 7 gRNAs were actually used in the experiments [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. As this field progresses to generate more sophisticated genetic circuits the requirement to express more gRNAs will also likely increase.</p><p>Although we developed a gRNA array platform for <italic>sp</italic>Cas9 using standard and MS2 containing chimeric gRNA backbones, similar platforms can likely be developed for other CRISPR orthologs (such as <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> Cas9 and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> Cas9), other modified gRNA backbones, and other CRISPR systems (such as <italic>Cpf1</italic>). Moreover, it is also possible to generate golden gate assembly libraries to mix and match various gRNA backbones to use multiple orthologs simultaneously. For instance, <italic>Sp</italic> dCas9-VP64 for gene activation combined with <italic>Sa</italic> dCas9-KRAB for gene repression using a gRNA array containing both <italic>Sp</italic> and <italic>Sa</italic> specific gRNA backbones. The use of <italic>Cpf1</italic> for enhanced multiplex genome engineering is especially intriguing based on recent work demonstrating that Cpf1 has both DNase and RNase activity. Fonfara et al. established that Cpf1 uses its DNase activity to induce sequence specific DSBs and its RNase function to process the transcribed CRISPR arrays into individual gRNAs [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Thus, by using <italic>Cpf1</italic> it may be possible to deliver just one protein to carry out the analogous function of Cas9 and Csy4 in the system described here.</p><p>Finally, a very exciting aspect of the gRNA array technology is the ability to use <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNA encoding the gRNA array. This approach may be especially desirable for multiplexed editing of primary human lymphocytes, such as T cells. It is well documented that plasmid DNA is highly toxic to primary lymphocytes [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and thus the use of IVT gRNA arrays may allow for highly efficient multiplex gene editing of primary human cell types for research and therapy. Indeed, we were able to generate and test IVT gRNA array in primary human T cells combined with mRNA encoding Csy4 and Cas9. However, we observed no detectable gene editing using this approach in primary human T cells (data not shown). This negative result may be due to a timing issue as the gRNA array is perhaps largely degraded by the time active Cas9 and Csy4 protein become abundant in the cells. This issue has been recently described using single IVT or chemically modified gRNAs in T cells [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Perhaps the use of purified Cas9 and Csy4 protein combined with IVT gRNA arrays will allow for highly multiplexed editing of primary cell types. An alternative approach would be to deliver the entire system with AAV6, which has been recently shown to be highly effective at delivering transient transgene expression in both primary human T cells and CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem cells [<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198714.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>The use of gRNA arrays for highly multiplexed genome engineering using the CRISPR system will likely help expand and enhance the ability to perform multiplexed genome engineering for basic research and therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0198714.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Gene editing frequency of individual gRNAs.</title><p>Single U6 driven gRNAs were transfected into HEK293T cells along with Cas9 encoding plasmids.
