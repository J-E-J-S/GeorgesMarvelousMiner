This is due to the typical activation of the versatile Non-homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway. Such unpredictability limits the utility of somatic gene editing for applications including gene therapy and functional genomics. For germline editing work, the accurate reproduction of the identical alleles using NHEJ is a labor intensive process. In this study, we propose Microhomology-mediated End Joining (MMEJ) as a viable solution for improving somatic sequence homogeneity <italic>in vivo</italic>, capable of generating a single predictable allele at high rates (56% ~ 86% of the entire mutant allele pool). Using a combined dataset from zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) <italic>in vivo</italic> and human HeLa cell <italic>in vitro</italic>, we identified specific contextual sequence determinants surrounding genomic DSBs for robust MMEJ pathway activation. We then applied our observation to prospectively design MMEJ-inducing sgRNAs against a variety of proof-of-principle genes and demonstrated high levels of mutant allele homogeneity. MMEJ-based DNA repair at these target loci successfully generated F0 mutant zebrafish embryos and larvae that faithfully recapitulated previously reported, recessive, loss-of-function phenotypes. We also tested the generalizability of our approach in cultured human cells. Finally, we provide a novel algorithm, MENTHU (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genesculpt.org/menthu/">http://genesculpt.org/menthu/</ext-link>), for improved and facile prediction of candidate MMEJ loci. We believe that this MMEJ-centric approach will have a broader impact on genome engineering and its applications. For example, whereas somatic mosaicism hinders efficient recreation of knockout mutant allele at base pair resolution via the standard NHEJ-based approach, we demonstrate that F0 founders transmitted the identical MMEJ allele of interest at high rates. Most importantly, the ability to directly dictate the reading frame of an endogenous target will have important implications for gene therapy applications in human genetic diseases.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>New gene editing tools precisely break DNA at pre-defined genomic locations, but cells repair these lesions using diverse pathways that often lead to unpredictable outcomes in the resulting DNA sequences. This sequence diversity in gene editing outcomes represents an important obstacle to the application of this technology for human therapies. Using a vertebrate animal as a model system, we provide strong evidence that we can overcome this obstacle by selectively directing DNA repair of double-stranded breaks through a lesser-described pathway termed Microhomology-mediated End Joining (MMEJ). Unlike other, better-understood pathways, MMEJ uses recurring short sequence patterns surrounding the site of DNA breakage. This enables the prediction of repair outcomes with improved accuracy. Importantly, we also show that preferential activation of MMEJ is compatible with effective gene editing. Finally, we provide a simple algorithm and software for designing DNA-breaking reagents that have high chance of activating the MMEJ pathway. We believe that the MMEJ-centric approach to be broadly applicable for a variety of gene editing applications both within the laboratory and for human therapies.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OD020166</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0726-4212</contrib-id><name><surname>Ekker</surname><given-names>Stephen C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1TR002377</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0726-4212</contrib-id><name><surname>Ekker</surname><given-names>Stephen C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM63904</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0726-4212</contrib-id><name><surname>Ekker</surname><given-names>Stephen C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30DK090728</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0726-4212</contrib-id><name><surname>Ekker</surname><given-names>Stephen C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>American Heart Association (US)</institution></funding-source><award-id>16PRE30470004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ata</surname><given-names>Hirotaka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007048</institution-id><institution>Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0726-4212</contrib-id><name><surname>Ekker</surname><given-names>Stephen C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award007"><funding-source><institution>Marriott Foundation</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0726-4212</contrib-id><name><surname>Ekker</surname><given-names>Stephen C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award008"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30DK84567</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0726-4212</contrib-id><name><surname>Ekker</surname><given-names>Stephen C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>NIH OD020166; NIH UL1TR002377; NIH GM63904; P30DK090728; NIH P30DK84567; AHA 16PRE30470004; Mayo MSTP; Mayo Foundation; and gift from Marriott Foundation.

However, DNA Double-strand Break (DSB) repairs largely result in diverse sequence outcomes owing to the unpredictable nature of the most commonly used Non-homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway [<xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007652.g001">Fig 1</xref></bold>). This significantly confounds experimental readouts as knock-out cell lines often harbor more than just one desired frameshift mutation. In the case of model organisms such as zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>), the F0 founders are genetically mosaic, warranting a complex and time-consuming series of outcrossing to establish molecularly defined lines before any biological questions can be addressed [<xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><fig id="pgen.1007652.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1007652.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>MMEJ is a unique DSB repair pathway that results in highly efficient and highly stereotyped mutagenesis.</title><p>DSB by conventionally designed Programmable Nucleases typically proceeds through a versatile yet unpredictable classical non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. As a result, a rather diverse cohort of mutant alleles are generated, making the subsequent selection process labor intensive to enrich for the allele of interest. The resulting genetic composition of the specific loci are often complex, requiring careful molecular characterization of each allele. Efficient activation of microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) pathway, on the other hand, can greatly limit allelic diversity and enable the intentional generation of a particular deletion allele of interest at a high rate. Consequently, the downstream applications become more streamlined with facile generation of homozygous frameshift allele in diploid cells.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1007652.g001"/></fig><p>In contrast to NHEJ, the MMEJ (Microhomology-mediated End Joining) DNA repair pathway utilizes a pair of locally available direct sequence repeats on both sides of a DSB that are apposed, annealed and extended [<xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].

[<xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] developed a sequence-based scoring system to estimate the frequency of MMEJ-associated deletions induced by DSBs in human cells. While this improved the predictability of MMEJ activation, the DSB repair outcomes tended to consist of a heterogeneous population of multiple MMEJ alleles. In this study, we sought to improve upon the existing algorithm with the goal of developing tools to more reliably predict target loci that would be predisposed to generate a more homogeneous mutant allele population through MMEJ. We demonstrate the feasibility and utility of such reagent design on the molecular level (i.e., DNA repair outcomes) and on the physiological level (i.e., F0 phenotype). We further demonstrate that our approach can be applied to generating highly homogeneous MMEJ alleles in cultured human cells, suggesting our findings may be broadly translatable to multiple model systems. We believe our approach can inform and benefit applications such as rapid phenotype-genotype correlation in F0 animals, with an eye toward applications in human gene therapy and facilitation of resource sharing &#x00026; recreation of various cell and animal lines on a global scale.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>MMEJ is an active repair pathway in the genetically unaltered zebrafish embryo</title><p>Prior works examining MMEJ activation in vertebrate organisms primarily focused on <italic>in vitro</italic> models [<xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

The plurality of custom enzymes induced diverse sequence outcomes, consistent with the idea that NHEJ is being used as the primary DNA repair pathway at these loci. However, a few reagents induced sequence outcomes satisfying the following criteria, suggesting that MMEJ was the preferred pathway: 1) most predominant mutant allele is the top predicted allele by the Bae, <italic>et al</italic> algorithm [<xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], 2) most predominant mutant allele comprises &#x02265; 50% of the total mutant allele population, and 3) mutagenic efficiency &#x0003e; 20%.

Here, we demonstrate the feasibility and utility of creating allelic consistency by an MMEJ-centric approach for designing programmable nucleases. While the precise cellular components of the molecular machinery involved in MMEJ remain incompletely understood [<xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], we provide evidence that we can enrich for MMEJ events by strictly sequence-based queries.</p><p>We also demonstrate that MMEJ predominant repairs do not operate at the cost of overall mutagenic efficiency; median edit efficiency for PreMA reagents was 91.4% in zebrafish. As genetically unaltered wildtype zebrafish were used throughout the study, we have no reason to believe that NHEJ should have failed at any tested loci. This is in contrast to the proposal that MMEJ is a back-up pathway to NHEJ [<xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our findings, on the other hand, are compatible with a previous report wherein MMEJ-specific factors such as PolQ are abundantly expressed in embryonic zebrafish [<xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Interestingly, maternally zygotic PolQ mutant embryos failed to repair DSB at two out of three MMEJ loci, leading to premature deaths [<xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The third locus&#x02013;which preferentially used a 2 bp microhomology and exhibited more heterogeneous DSB repair outcomes&#x02013;was able to be repaired at a measurable rate, though significantly less so than in WT embryos. Thus NHEJ and MMEJ may be non-competing, parallel processes with unique triggers.</p><p>Based on the data presented here, we speculate that there is a reaction-limiting factor for MMEJ that is involved in identifying compatible microhomology pairs on both sides of the DNA double stranded break. In the case of abundantly available local microhomology pairs, this factor may fail to localize to a single suitable pair, thus rejecting the MMEJ activation. As end-resection is required for MMEJ and not for NHEJ [<xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], this yet identified factor may be the deciding factor for committing DSB repair through one End Joining pathway to another. This view is similar to a recent report wherein CtIP/Artemis dependent limited end resection was a key trigger for a slow-kinetic Lig1/3 independent NHEJ event that frequently utilized Microhomology to repair a reporter plasmid [<xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In our analysis, the primary driver of this decision making process is the proximity of 2 microhomology arms, further aided by the lack of competing microhomology arms.</p><p>Successful deployment of the PreMA reagents makes it possible to directly dictate the reading frame or to do in-frame gene manipulations on endogenous targets. Even assuming a somewhat modest outcome of 50% edit efficiency in which 50% of the mutant allele pool is of the desirable allele, more than 10% of the cell population will be homozygous for this desired allele. Conversely, many real-life gene editing applications would require only one of the diploid copies to be corrected. In these settings under the same assumptions, just 11 viable cells are needed to achieve 95% confidence for establishing the right clone, bringing the idea of precision molecular surgery closer to reality.</p><p>Our present study expands upon the current state-of-art understanding for MMEJ activation and demonstrates the ability to prospectively design robustly active PreMA reagents <italic>in-vivo</italic>. We also provide evidence that this 2-component approach may be broadly applicable beyond zebrafish; testing of the true generalizability of our approach will be facilitated by our web-based application, MENTHU (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genesculpt.org/menthu/">http://genesculpt.org/menthu/</ext-link>). Importantly, MENTHU allows users to flexibly define a PAM sequence and the cut site (in nts from PAM) so as to accommodate potential future variants of the CRISPR system. Active investigations are underway to accommodate alternative or more lax PAM requirements, such as the case with xCas9&#x02013;a recently described variant of Cas9 that may function efficiently on an NG PAM [<xref rid="pgen.1007652.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. As MMEJ-based loci are inherently restricted to genomic locations that leverage endogenous sequence contexts, availability of more flexible programmable nucleases will become the key for broadening the utility of PreMA reagents.</p><p>We provide strong evidence to support the utility of the MMEJ-centric approach beyond phenotype-genotype correlations in F0 animals. We envision this approach to be useful for: 1) studying the effects of homozygous gene knock-out in culture cells (as opposed to more common, compound heterozygous loss-of-function cell lines), 2) rapid small molecule screening in F0 animals as a complimentary approach to studying in germline mutant animals, 3) globally sharing and reproducing gene knock-out cell and animal lines, 4) pathway dissection for MMEJ, and finally, 5) human gene therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The animal studies were conducted following guidelines and standard procedures established by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Mayo IACUC).
