are powerful catalysts for site-selective C&#x02013;H bond
functionalization. Identifying suitable enzymes for this task and
for biocatalysis in general remains challenging, however, due to the
fundamental difficulty of predicting catalytic activity from sequence
information. In this study, family-wide activity profiling was used
to obtain sequence&#x02013;function information on flavin-dependent
halogenases (FDHs). This broad survey provided a number of insights
into FDH activity, including halide specificity and substrate preference,
that were not apparent from the more focused studies reported to date.
Regions of FDH sequence space that are most likely to contain enzymes
suitable for halogenating small-molecule substrates were also identified.
FDHs with novel substrate scope and complementary regioselectivity
on large, three-dimensionally complex compounds were characterized
and used for preparative-scale late-stage C&#x02013;H functionalization.
In many cases, these enzymes provide activities that required several
rounds of directed evolution to accomplish in previous efforts, highlighting
that this approach can achieve significant time savings for biocatalyst
identification and provide advanced starting points for further evolution.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="short"><p>High-throughput screening of &#x0003e;20&#x0202f;000 reactions catalyzed

tools for the synthesis of fine chemicals,
pharmaceuticals,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> agrochemicals, and many
other materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> On the other hand, the
very features that give rise to the selectivity and catalytic proficiency
of enzymes acting on their native substrates often lead to high substrate
specificity and thus poor activity on non-native substrates. The dearth
of enzymes available for reactions of interest can therefore be a
major impediment to implementing enzymes in synthetic routes. Many
of the enzymes commonly used today (e.g., ketoreductases, transaminases,
cytochromes P450, etc.) were originally identified via arduous enzymology
aimed at clarifying their native biological activities. Often, many
rounds of directed evolution were also required to optimize these
enzymes for synthetic applications. Expanding the number of known
biocatalysts, with an emphasis on exploring broad sequence diversity
within an enzyme family, could therefore greatly facilitate the use
of enzymes in chemical synthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup></p><p>Numerous
methods have been used to explore the functional diversity
of naturally occurring enzymes in discrete genomes, metagenomic samples,
and sequence databases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> Advances in DNA
sequencing&#x02014;in particular, metagenome sequencing&#x02014;have
resulted in an explosion of the size of protein sequence databases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Coupled with the decreasing cost of gene synthesis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> mining these sequence databases for potential
biocatalysts is becoming increasingly accessible to scientists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Such approaches are most commonly used to identify
enzymes that act on a substrate of interest, often a chromogenic probe
compound chosen more for ease of screening than for synthetic utility,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> but efforts to profile the activity of entire enzyme families on
a range of substrates and identify biocatalysts with a collectively
broad substrate scope are less common. Family-wide profiling efforts
include investigations on phosphatases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> metallo-&#x003b2;-lactamases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> and glutathione-S-transferases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Studies on dehalogenases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> esterases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> glycosyl transferases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> and imine reductases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> highlight the potential synthetic utility of enzymes identified
from such efforts. Comparable genome mining efforts on enzymes that
functionalize C&#x02013;H bonds have not been reported.</p><p>Flavin-dependent
halogenases (FDHs), which catalyze site-selective
C&#x02013;H halogenation of electron-rich aromatic compounds, have
been studied extensively due to their potential synthetic utility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Late-stage functionalization,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> sequential
halogenation/cross-coupling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> and preparative-scale halogenation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> have all been accomplished using these enzymes.
Our efforts have focused primarily on RebH, an FDH that was identified
in studies aimed at elucidating the biosynthetic pathway of the antitumor
compound rebeccamycin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> In this context,
RebH catalyzes site-selective chlorination of tryptophan, and it has
since been shown to halogenate a range of indoles and anilines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> Our group has also shown that directed evolution
can be used to create RebH variants with improved thermal stability,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> high activity on large, biologically active
compounds,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> and high selectivity for different
sites on target compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> While effective,
these efforts required 3&#x02013;10 rounds of directed evolution due
to the wild-type enzyme&#x02019;s modest stability, low activity on
large substrates, and high regioselectivity.</p><p>While additional
FDHs could therefore expand the utility of these
enzymes for synthesis, only a relatively narrow set of FDHs have been
investigated for biocatalysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> FDHs that
catalyze tryptophan chlorination, such as RebH, Thal,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> SttH,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> and PrnA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> in particular are over-represented. Fungal halogenases,
such as Rdc2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> RadH,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> and GsfI,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> which natively chlorinate
phenol-containing substrates, have also been shown to be active and
selective biocatalysts. Literature reports on the collective substrate
scopes of the FDHs reported to date suggest that they prefer chloride
over other halides and that they act on electron-rich compounds similar
to their native substrate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> On the other
hand, the existence of a range of complex halogenated natural products
distinct from those produced by well-characterized biosynthetic gene
clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> implies that FDHs with unique
substrate scopes might be found in less characterized halogenase subgroups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> We hypothesized that exploring uncharacterized
FDHs found in protein sequence databases could, together with currently
characterized enzymes, form a diverse starting toolkit for selective
late-stage C&#x02013;H halogenation.</p><p>Herein, we describe the
use of a high-throughput mass-spectrometry-based
screen to evaluate a broad set of over 100 putative FDH sequences
drawn from throughout the FDH family. Halogenases with novel substrate
scope and complementary regioselectivity on large, three-dimensionally
complex compounds were identified. This effort involved far more extensive
sequence&#x02013;function analysis than has been accomplished using
the relatively narrow range of FDHs characterized to date, providing
a clearer picture of the regions in FDH sequence space that are most
likely to contain enzymes suitable for halogenating small-molecule
substrates. The representative enzyme panel constructed in this study
also provides a rapid means to identify FDHs for lead diversification
via late-stage C&#x02013;H functionalization. In many cases, these
enzymes provide activities that required several rounds of directed
evolution to accomplish in previous efforts, highlighting that this
approach can achieve significant time savings for biocatalyst identification
and provide advanced starting points for further evolution.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Organization

Nearly all (&#x0003e;90%) previously reported FDHs are present in this

increases to 78% when motif variants WxWxI[R,G]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> are included. Collectively, these analyses suggest that
the majority of the sequences examined are likely FDHs.</p><p>Sequence-similarity

second largest subnetwork comprises 438 sequences from bacteria

diverse, soluble FDHs was subjected to a high-throughput activity
screen to evaluate which enzymes had detectable activity and, for
active enzymes, to develop substrate activity profiles to better understand
whether activity and subnetwork membership were related. For initial
activity screens, a set of 12 probe substrates&#x02014;4 indoles, 4
anilines, and 4 phenols&#x02014;was selected from among the substrates
previously found by our group to be reactive under FDH chlorination
conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>A). The key hypothesis governing selection of these substrates was
that their high inherent reactivity, reflected in their high calculated
halenium affinity values,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">67</xref></sup> would lead to detectable
reactivity with active enzymes even if they exhibited poor binding
within FDH active sites. Structural variation within the panel was
used to facilitate the identification of viable substrates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref68">68</xref></sup> and substrates with multiple potentially reactive
sites were prioritized to increase the probability that reactive binding
poses could be achieved. Initial screens evaluated both chlorination
and bromination activities, the two most common halogenation reactions
catalyzed by FDHs. The probe substrate screens required at least 2088
independent experiments, not including replicates or controls. This
heavy screening requirement prompted us to adopt a high-throughput
LC-MS-based screen (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>B), which also required that viable substrates ionize well

to halogenate at least one of the probe substrates. Halogenation of
nearly the entire probe substrate panel was achieved by the genome-mined

new halogenase. Overall, bromination activity was more prevalent than
chlorination activity. All genome-mined enzymes that were active had
brominase activity, but only 16% of the enzyme set had detectable
chlorinase activity. Activity was unevenly distributed across the

chlorination activity of RebH and a highly similar enzyme, 1-B12.

together based on their activity profiles. Four activity clusters
of enzymes (AC1&#x02013;4) can be distinguished from the probe substrate
high-throughput screening data. AC1, at the top of the heatmap, contained
almost exclusively halogenases in the Indole Subnetwork. None of the
Indole Subnetwork enzymes in this AC were in either of the two Level
2 tryptophan subnetworks, however, and they were distinguished by
their preference for bromination of phenols and anilines. Despite
the fact that indoles are the most common substrates known to be halogenated
by enzymes in the Indole Subnetwork, halogenase activity on indoles
in AC1 was limited. Pindolol was the only indole halogenated by more
than one enzyme, and only a single FDH, 1-F08 (34% identical to SttH),
chlorinated more than one indole.</p><p>Activity cluster 2 (AC2) had
similar bromination scope to AC1 but
had higher breadth of phenol chlorination activity. Only two of the
nine enzymes in this activity cluster were present in the Indole Subnetwork,
whereas four were in the Phenol Subnetwork. Halogenase 1-F11, from
an unannotated subnetwork within the Indole Subnetwork (38% identical
to tryptophan-5 halogenase ClaH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref72">72</xref></sup>), and
2-C01, a halogenase in the same subnetwork as the lanthipeptide indole
halogenase MibH (36% identical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref></sup>), were
capable of chlorinating multiple phenols, 2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone
(2,4-DHAP) and 7-hydroxycoumarin. The FDH 2-C01 was particularly versatile
in halide scope. UC-066, 7-hydroxycoumarin, and 2,4-DHAP were chlorinated
and brominated by 2-C01 with similar yields. Enzyme 1-F05, from the
Phenol Subnetwork (49% identical to ArmH4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73">73</xref></sup>), was similarly versatile in the halides it accepted, but its activity
was specific for phenolic probe substrates. It had the broadest phenol
substrate scope of any enzyme tested, but did not halogenate any aniline
or indole.</p><p>Activity cluster 3 (AC3) was small and populated
by low-activity
enzymes only having bromination activity on the substrates that were
most easily halogenated. AC4 contained only two enzymes, RebH and
1-B12, that had the broadest substrate scope, particularly on indole
probe substrates. The high probe substrate scope of RebH was expected
by design, since the indoles and anilines of the probe panel were
assembled from substrates that were known to be chlorinated by RebH.
The enzyme 1-B12 has high sequence similarity to RebH (64% identical)
and a strongly similar substrate activity profile.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>Activity and
Selectivity of Mined Halogenases toward Complex
Substrates</title><p>Based on the remarkable activity that our genome-mined
halogenases exhibited toward probe substrates, we next wondered whether
they might be capable of halogenating substrates that were not selected

for these activity studies (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>A). Among the compounds in this expanded substrate

of FDHs revealed several notable trends that are not apparent from
prior studies. First, FDHs from diverse host organisms can be solubly
expressed without significant optimization of expression conditions.
Bacterial enzymes had the highest soluble expression success rate
(76%), while a lower fraction (40%) of eukaryotic enzymes were soluble.
Notably, however, the lower fraction of soluble eukaryotic FDHs reflects
the poorer solubility of halogenases in the Phenol Subnetwork regardless
of host organism domain. Nearly all (20/23) of the eukaryotic proteins
evaluated were within the Phenol Subnetwork. Within this subnetwork,
the soluble expression rate is generally low, but it is actually higher
for proteins from eukaryotes (54%) relative to bacteria (44%). This
finding indicates that eukaryotic FDHs can be readily expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and that genome mining efforts should be encouraged
to include enzymes from eukaryotic species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref74">74</xref></sup></p><p>Second, halogenase activity was also evenly distributed between
enzymes from bacterial and eukaryotic organisms (48% and 56% active,
respectively). FDH activity was not observed for any archaeal proteins
evaluated, consistent with the strong possibility that most if not
all archaeal sequences in the SSN are geranylgeranyl reductases. Interestingly,
one viral FDH, a cyanophage auxiliary metabolic gene product,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75">75</xref></sup> was active, though its activity and substrate
scope were low (conversion of &#x0003c;35% on only three probe substrates
was observed). In general, the identification of such a high percentage
of active halogenases, despite the use of non-native substrates for
activity profiling and a lax homology requirement for evaluation (<italic>E</italic>-value threshold of 10<sup>&#x02013;5</sup>), suggests that
this family contains a large number of enzymes suitable for biocatalysis.</p><p>Third, bromination activity was much more widespread than chlorination
activity within the FDHs surveyed. The majority of the FDH biocatalysis
literature focuses on chlorination activity because most FDHs reported
to date are involved in the biosynthesis of chlorinated natural products.
Moore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref76">76</xref></sup> has reported three flavin-dependent
brominases involved in the biosynthesis of brominated natural products,
but these are more distantly related to enzymes comprising the SSN
in the current study. These brominases have 17 &#x000b1; 4% sequence
identity to enzymes in the SSN; for comparison, RebH exhibits 29 &#x000b1;
10% sequence identity to our genome-mined enzymes. Sewald<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref></sup> reported flavin-dependent halogenases (contained in the Indole Subnetwork
of the FDH SSN) that prefer bromide over chloride when acting on the
(presumably) non-native substrate indole. While this observation was
taken to indicate specificity of these enzymes toward bromide, our
findings indicate that a preference for bromination is common in FDHs.
We suggest that the higher electrophilicity of bromine relative to
chlorine in heteroatom-X species,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref77">77</xref></sup> such
as the proposed hypohalous acid or haloamine halogenating agents in
FDH catalysis, leads to more facile bromination. For example, the
native chlorinase RebH can brominate a greater range of non-native
substrates than it can chlorinate. Preference for bromination over
chlorination for non-native as well as native substrates is also observed
when both Cl<sup>&#x02013;</sup> and Br<sup>&#x02013;</sup> are present
in solution. In competition reactions including both NaCl and NaBr,
RebH prefers bromide over chloride for <sc>L</sc>-tryptophan, 1-phenylpiperazine,
pindolol, and 2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone halogenation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">64</xref></sup> It is therefore possible that enzymes with higher bromination
than chlorination scope in our high-throughput screen could nevertheless
natively catalyze chlorination reactions.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>Analyzing FDH Activity
Using Sequence-Similarity Networks and
Activity Clustering</title><p>Sequence-similarity networks provide
an intuitive structure for exploring the protein sequence space of
enzyme families. The FDH SSN contains Level 1 subnetworks comprising
enzymes with similar native substrate preferences (indole vs phenol,
etc.). At a more stringent identity threshold cutoff, Level 2 subnetworks
with finer functional distinction are revealed. Within the Level 1
Phenol Subnetwork, for example, different Level 2 subnetworks containing
primarily either variant A or variant B halogenases, which natively
halogenate free small molecules or ACP-tethered substrates, respectively,
are observed. The ability to distinguish such enzyme subclasses based
on sequence alone is useful for focusing future genome mining efforts
since our data indicate that neither of the variant B phenol halogenases
examined were even soluble. Information on site selectivity could
also be obtained directly from sequence information in some cases.
For example, within the Level 1 Indole Subnetwork, separation of tryptophan
5- and 7-halogenases into distinct Level 2 subnetworks was apparent,
though tryptophan 6-halogenases were roughly evenly distributed between
these subgroups.</p><p>Only six of the Level 1 subnetworks (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>A) examined contained
enzymes with measurable chlorination or bromination activity on our
probe substrate set, but these subnetworks contained 78% of the FDHs
within the SSN. Specifically, enzymes in the Indole Subnetwork (66%),
the Phenol Subnetwork (42%), the Pyrrole Subnetwork (2/5), subnetwork
4 (2/2), subnetwork 8 (1/2), and the MibH subnetwork (1/1) were active.
These findings reflect the nature of the probe substrates chosen,
but given the range of substrates examined and the similarity of these
substrates to pharmaceuticals and other fine chemicals, they also
highlight regions of FDH sequence space most likely to be of interest
for biocatalysis.</p><p>Active enzymes were found in most Level 2
subnetworks that comprise
the Level 1 Indole Subnetwork (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>B). For example, all enzymes in both tryptophan halogenase
subnetworks were active, as was the only enzyme in subnetwork 21.
Most enzymes in the BrvH halogenase subnetwork (84%), three out of
four enzymes in subnetwork 2PYX, and two of three enzymes (1-C08 and
1-F11) in subnetwork 9 were active. The activity results within the
Indole Subnetwork broadly show that a high fraction of these enzymes
have potential as useful biocatalysts and highlight several underexplored
regions in the FDH sequence space that merit further investigation.</p><p>Analysis of Level 2 subnetworks within the Level 1 Phenol Subnetwork
also highlights regions with high potential for biocatalyst identification.
The majority of the tested enzymes in the variant A subnetwork, including
1-F05, were active (66%), but both of the variant B halogenases were
insoluble under the conditions examined. The only soluble genome-mined
enzyme in the large phenol halogenase subnetwork containing XanH was
active. The single evaluated enzyme in the NapH2 subnetwork was inactive,
as were the six soluble enzymes that were either singletons or within
small (&#x0003c;15 members) subnetworks. Overall, the variant A subnetwork
within the Phenol Subnetwork shows clear promise as a source of novel
biocatalysts, but further study of other subnetworks would be required
to get a clearer picture of their potential.</p><p>Finally, functional
characterization of enzymes across the FDH
SSN demonstrated that enzymes within a Level 1 subnetwork have similar
activity profiles on smaller probe substrates but that this trend
diminishes on more complex substrates. Not surprisingly, more closely
related enzymes possess more similar activity profiles. Highly similar
substrate activity profiles are observed for RebH and 1-B12 (64% identical),
both of which are within the Level 2 tryptophan 6,7-halogenase subnetwork,
as well as for halogenases 1-H11 and 1-F10 (50% identical), both of
which are in the Level 2 BrvH subnetwork. These trends suggest an
approximate %ID threshold for future genome-mining of new halogenases
with similar substrate scopes. Because the gene selection process
of this study intentionally favored diverse sequences to maximize
the breadth of our search for new halogenases, however, there are
few instances of such similar enzyme pairs in which both were soluble
and highly active. The average %ID for the most closely related enzyme
within the genome-mined set was 41.2 &#x000b1; 12.4%, perhaps too low
for similarities in activity profiles among enzymes to result in consistent
trends. More thorough genome mining of subnetworks with highly active
FDHs could yield more concrete activity profiles and reveal more detailed
information regarding enzyme substrate preferences.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>Unique Activity
and Selectivity of Mined Halogenases</title><p>The selectivity of FDHs

a particular application, however, a number of laboratories have explored
the use of targeted mutations to alter FDH selectivity. While grafting
key residues from one tryptophan halogenase into another has been
used to switch selectivity on tryptophan,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> modest selectivity has generally been reported for efforts focused
on non-native substrates (e.g., converting SttH from 90% 6-selective
to 75% 5-selective for 3-indolepropionic acid chlorination).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref84">84</xref></sup> To address this issue, our lab established that directed evolution
can be used to generate FDHs with high (&#x0003e;90%) regioselectivity
for
different sites on a single substrate (tryptamine), and that the resulting
enzymes also had altered selectivity on a range of other substrates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> Several rounds of evolution were required to
achieve this goal, so accelerating the identification of FDHs with
complementary regioselectivity on non-native substrates remains an
important goal.</p><p>Gratifyingly, a number of enzymes identified
in our family-wide survey of FDH activity exhibited regiocomplementarity
on a number of structurally complex substrates. For example, the enzyme
2-C01 often provided different regiochemical outcomes as compared
to other halogenases. This FDH is present in a subnetwork along with
MibH, which natively chlorinates a tryptophan indole ring in a large
lanthipeptide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref></sup> MibH has a large, hydrophobic
binding pocket in order to accommodate its native substrate. The genome-mined
halogenase 2-C01 may have a similar active site, which could accommodate
large substrates in distinct binding poses. This finding suggests
that 2-C01 could be a promising starting point for evolving FDHs to
achieve late-stage functionalization of aryl C&#x02013;H bonds with
distinct regioselectivity relative to other FDHs characterized to
date.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>Comparison of the Genome-Mined Halogenase Library with Evolved

before they are capable of being deployed as useful catalysts for

access to a diverse pool of enzymes that can serve as starting points
for directed evolution can greatly expedite biocatalyst identification.
While evolving a single enzyme can take a great deal of effort and
may ultimately fail to provide the desired levels of improvement,
a related enzyme may be better suited initially to the task and can
drastically reduce the effort required to obtain a desired biocatalyst.
This point can be retrospectively illustrated by several enzymes in

over three rounds of directed evolution for improved thermal stability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> Since more stable enzymes can have a longer
catalytic lifetime and can better tolerate random mutations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref86">86</xref></sup> 1-F11 provides a convenient starting point for
directed evolution. 1-F11 also compares favorably in substrate scope
with the RebH mutant 4V, which was evolved over four rounds of directed
evolution for the late-stage C&#x02013;H functionalization of yohimbine,
a complex, biologically active molecule.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Because RebH has minimal activity on yohimbine, a substrate-walking
directed evolution approach was required to evolve an enzyme that
could halogenate this compound. Enzyme 1-F11, on the other hand, was
capable of brominating yohimbine without any modification through
directed evolution (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>C). In short, 1-F11 possesses capabilities that took a total
of seven rounds of directed evolution using two different approaches
to accomplish, highlighting the benefits of family-wide genome mining
for biocatalyst identification. Moreover, given the broad substrate
scope of 1-F11, we envision it could be an ideal starting point for
further directed evolution.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>(A) Comparison of isolated RebH and 1-F11 protein

were first characterized in the mid-1990s. Since this time,
most of the FDHs reported have come from either studies on individual
biosynthetic pathways or genome mining efforts targeting specific
organisms or metagenomic samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>C and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>E,F illustrate how these efforts
have focused on a remarkably narrow range of FDH sequence space and
missed out on large swaths of this space that contain functional enzymes,
respectively. Family-wide activity analysis shows that similar fractions
of FDHs from bacteria and fungi are soluble and active and that bromination
is more commonly observed than chlorination. Broader sampling of this
space has not only led to the identification of new enzymes with unique
catalytic properties but also highlighted regions of sequence space
that are ripe for further exploration. As noted above, other regions
might also be suitable for different types of substrates than those
examined herein, but for the electron-rich aromatic compounds explored
to date, these regions are clearly privileged. Moreover, the SSNs
and substrate activity profiles developed in this study offer a predictive
ability for focusing biocatalyst selection or further genome mining
efforts for particular applications. Extending this approach, involving
SSN-guided selection of sequences from throughout an enzyme family,
label-free high-throughput mass spectrometry screening using synthetic
probe substrates, and activity profiling, to other enzymes has great
potential for expediting biocatalyst identification.</p><p>Beyond
these family-wide findings, a number of remarkably useful
enzymes were identified in the representative set that was explored.
Particularly notable in this regard are 1-F11, 1-F08, 2-C01, 1-F05,
and 1-B12. Collectively, these enzymes enable C&#x02013;H halogenation
of previously inaccessible substrates, provide complementary site
selectivity on complex biologically active substrates, and exhibit
improved thermostability relative to a commonly reported FDH. Their
sequences also differ significantly from other FDHs that have been
explored <italic>in vitro</italic>. With the exception of 1-B12, which
is 64% identical to RebH, they are only 34&#x02013;43% identical to
FDHs that have been explored as biocatalysts. These novel and diverse
halogenases therefore represent promising starting points for both
directed evolution and additional genome mining aimed at identifying
similarly effective biocatalysts. The activity of these enzymes on
complex natural products and pharmaceuticals also suggests that their
native substrates could be similarly fascinating structures. It could
therefore be interesting to examine the native function of these enzymes,
reversing the enzymology-to-biocatalysis progression that has dominated
biocatalyst development to date.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> This
approach could provide a unique means of identifying new halogenated
natural products and other unique compounds when extended to other
enzyme classes.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="notes1" notes-type="si"><title>Supporting Information Available</title><p>The Supporting Information is
