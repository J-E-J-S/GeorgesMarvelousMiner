The last human plague epidemic in Yunnan occurred from 1986&#x02013;2005. On June 6, 2016, a case of human plague was reported in the Xishuangbanna Prefecture, Yunnan. The patient suffered from primary septicemic plague after exposure to a dead house rat (<italic>Rattus flavipectus</italic>), which has been identified as the main plague reservoir in the local epizootic area. Moreover, a retrospective investigation identified another bubonic plague case in this area. Based on these data, human plague reemerged after a silent period of ten years. In this study, three molecular typing methods, including a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) analysis, different region analysis (DFR), and multiple-locus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (MLVA), were used to illustrate the molecular characteristics of <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> (<italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pestis</italic>) strains isolated in Yunnan. The DFR profiles of the strains isolated in Yunnan in 2016 were the same as the strains that had previously been isolated in this <italic>Rattus flavipectus</italic> plague focus. The c3 spacer present in the previously isolated strains was absent in the spacer arrays of the Ypc CRISPR loci of the strains isolated in 2016. The MLVA analysis using MLVA (14+12) showed that the strains isolated from the human plague case and host animal plague infection in 2016 in Yunnan displayed different molecular patterns than the strains that had previously been isolated from Yunnan and adjacent provinces.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81160354</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Peng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>the Yunnan Provincial Training Program of Young Academic and Technical Leader</institution></funding-source><award-id>2014HB037</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Peng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>the National Priority Development Project on Key Science Instrument</institution></funding-source><award-id>2012YQ09019706</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0968-400X</contrib-id><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>PW was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81160354) and the Yunnan Provincial Training Program of Young Academic and Technical Leader (2014HB037); WL was funded by the National Priority Development Project on Key Science Instrument (2012YQ09019706).

Plague killed millions of individuals in Europe in the 14<sup>th</sup> century. In China, tens of thousands of individuals died of plague in the 19<sup>th</sup> century [<xref rid="pone.0198067.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Plague is primarily a disease carried by rodents and is transmitted among animals bitten by infected fleas. Cases of human plague occur when these fleas, notably <italic>Xenopsylla cheopis</italic>, bite humans. Outbreaks of human plague frequently occur as a result of epizootics in rats, particularly rat species that have flourished around human habitations, such as <italic>Rattus rattus</italic> and <italic>Rattus flavipectus</italic>.</p><p>Three major types of plague exist in humans: bubonic, pneumonic and septicemic plague. Person-to-person transmission typically occurs only among patients with pneumonic plague. Two subspecies of the pathogens that cause plague have been recognized based on their pathogenicity in the anthroponotic form: <italic>pestis</italic> and <italic>microtus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0198067.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Four biovars have also been classified according to their biochemical properties and include antiqua, mediaevalis, orientalis and microtus [<xref rid="pone.0198067.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These biovars have been implicated in several devastating pandemics over the previous 1500 years, with the exception of the microtus biovar [<xref rid="pone.0198067.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The third plague pandemic was caused by <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pestis</italic> biovar orientalis (positive for nitrate reduction and negative for glycerol utilization) and originated from Yunnan Province in China in the middle of the 19<sup>th</sup> century; it eventually affected more than 60 countries and regions worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0198067.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Based on historical data, Yunnan Province was seriously affected by the plague prior to 1955 [<xref rid="pone.0198067.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Currently, three types of plague foci are detected in Yunnan Province, namely, the Yunnan <italic>Rattus flavipectus</italic> plague focus (also regarded as the house rat plague focus by Chinese scientists, as rodent hosts have been determined to mainly inhabit local residents&#x02019; houses or yards). The other two types include Jianchuan and Yulong plague foci (these two foci have been characterized as wild mouse (sylvatic) plague foci by Chinese plague researchers). The main reservoir and vector in the Yunnan house rat plague focus (Urban rat plague focus) are the <italic>R</italic>. <italic>flavipectus</italic> and the <italic>Xenopsylla cheopis</italic>. Together with the Guangdong and Fujian provinces&#x02019; house rat plague foci identified in the 1950s, these plague foci have been identified as <italic>R</italic>. <italic>flavipectus</italic> plague foci in China, and the <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pestis</italic> biovars are orientalis.</p><p>In China, plague epidemics have been successfully controlled in house rat foci since the mid-1950s. Moreover, active animal plague surveillance programs have been conducted annually in China since the 1980s. However, after a 26-year silent period, a human plague epidemic reemerged in the western region in Yunnan and then spread eastward from 1986&#x02013;2005 [<xref rid="pone.0198067.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The areas that were most substantially affected by this epidemic are located in the southern and southwestern regions of Yunnan Province. Five hundred seven human cases and two deaths were confirmed during this plague epidemic. Twenty-nine of the 129 counties and nine of the 16 prefectures (cities) were affected [<xref rid="pone.0198067.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This epidemic was also caused by <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pestis</italic> biovar orientalis [<xref rid="pone.0198067.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Adjacent provinces, such as Guizhou and Guangxi, were affected in 2000&#x02013;2002. The human plague epidemic and rodent plague epizootic ended in 2005 and 2007, respectively. However, a human plague infection with characteristics of <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pestis</italic> biovar orientalis strains was reported in 2016 in Yunnan. In the present study, three molecular subtyping methods, including different region analysis (DFR), clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), and multiple-locus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (MLVA), were used to describe the genetic relationships among the strains isolated in 2016, as well as isolates from the previous plague epidemics in the house rat plague focus. In addition, a source tracing investigation was performed using the MLVA(14+12) scheme.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All procedures involved in the survey and diagnosis of human plague cases were performed in accordance with ethical standards.

Enhanced surveillance of rats in the habitations of local residents was subsequently conducted in this region.

In the Yunnan <italic>R</italic>. <italic>flavipectus</italic> plague focus, no cases of human plague had been reported since 1955. However, after a 26-year silent period, a human plague epidemic swept from western to eastern regions in Yunnan between 1986 and 2005 [<xref rid="pone.0198067.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In fact, the presence of a plague epizootic was observed in 1982 [<xref rid="pone.0198067.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. More intensive rodents plague surveillance has been performed in Yunnan since the human plague epidemic began in 1986. No rodent plague epidemics were observed in house rat plague foci (Urban rat plague focus). Moreover, no human plague cases were reported for this focus after the end of the previously described epidemic; this state lasted for one decade until two human plague cases were reported in 2016 [<xref rid="pone.0198067.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The occurrence of two human plague cases in 2016 suggests a reemergence of human plague caused by <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pestis</italic> biovar orientalis strains in China; corresponding phylogenetic evidence supports the conclusion that human plague cases identified in Yunnan in 2016 originated from rats that died of plague.</p><p>In epidemiological investigations, the use of reliable subtyping methods is a prerequisite for identifying links among isolates and for understanding the dynamics of pathogen spread. Different molecular genotyping methods based on different principles have different applications. For example, the DFR analysis, which is mainly based on horizontal gene transfer or gene loss [<xref rid="pone.0198067.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0198067.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], has been used to illustrate the microevolution of <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pestis</italic>. The spacer sequences in CRISPR loci are considered an immunological mechanism against bacteriophages or plasmids and might participate in cellular regulatory mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0198067.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, the spacer arrays of CRISPR loci may serve as a &#x0201c;chronicle&#x0201d; that documents the occurrence of the previously described bacterial gene events and may be used to illustrate the adaptive microevolution of <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pestis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0198067.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The strain isolated from patients in the 2016 case shared a similar DFR profile with the strains previously isolated in Yunnan; however, the c3 spacer was absent in the spacer arrays of the Ypc CRISPR loci of the strains isolated in 2016. These CRISPR patterns had not been observed in the <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pestis</italic> strains that were previously isolated in Yunnan or reported in the available literature [<xref rid="pone.0198067.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198067.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0198067.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>A notable advantage of MLVA typing is its flexibility. Different sets of VNTR loci may be used to assess the performance of different phylogenetic investigations over different temporal or spatial scales. Previously described MLVA methods included 25 and 42&#x02013;46 VNTR loci [<xref rid="pone.0198067.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0198067.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Using a serial hierarchical assessment, an optimized 14 VNTR loci-based scheme has been developed with a corresponding discriminatory power that may be considered compatible with single nucleotide polymorphism-based phylogenic analysis [<xref rid="pone.0198067.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], whereas the inclusion of an additional twelve loci with greater diversity may be useful when tracking the source of the outbreak. The phylogenetic relationship yielded by the MLVA14 scheme indicated that some strains isolated in previous epidemics in the southern provinces of China (Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi), including strains isolated in Burma, exhibited homologous MLVA14 profiles with the isolates collected in 2016 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198067.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Thus, based on the MLVA14 data, the pathogen that caused the human case in Yunnan in 2016 was similar to the pathogens responsible for previous epidemics in Yunnan or other regions.</p><p>Some researchers have investigated the possible mechanism of the interepizootic persistence of plague, such as the persistence of <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pestis</italic> in soil, where plague microbes may be preserved in microfoci, etc. [<xref rid="pone.0198067.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In fact, the mechanisms of interepizootic maintenance of plague are still a main question that remains unanswered.

In fact, any ecological disturbance that changes the dynamics of the main host or main vector, even human activities, such as agricultural activities or a mass slaughter of the rodents, could unleash a flood of homeless fleas that would then transfer to humans and domestic animals and infect them with plague.</p><p>Interestingly, the cases of human plague that occurred in 2016 had a close relationship with the strains isolated in Dehong and Baoshan during the last <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pestis</italic> biovar orientalis epidemic. Therefore, we hypothesized that the 2016 plague event in Yunnan was the successor of the previous epidemic, although several genomic differences were observed, such as the absence of the c3 spacer identified by the CRISPR analysis and the diversity of the 12 VNTRs identified by the MLVA(14+12) scheme. We also want to emphasize that <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pestis</italic> may be transported from comparatively distant areas by rodents. Therefore, we were not able to exclude the possibility that <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pestis</italic> may have been imported into the affected region from neighboring areas. More detailed investigations, including ongoing biological and anthropologic investigations, are necessary, and genome-based analyses may also provide additional information regarding the origin and microevolution of this bacterium.</p><p>The third plague pandemic caused by <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pestis</italic> biovar orientalis originated from Yunnan Province in China in the middle of the 19<sup>th</sup> century and killed millions of individuals in Asia, Europe, America, Africa and Australia. The human plague cases identified in Yunnan in 2016 suggests that <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pestis</italic> biovar orientalis plague reemerged in China.
