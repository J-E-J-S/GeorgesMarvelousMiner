Adult cardiomyocytes have limited self-renewal capacity; thus, the efficient, safe, and clinically applicable generation of autologous cardiomyocytes is of great interest for the treatment of damaged myocardium. In this study, footprint-free iPSCs were successfully generated from urine-derived renal epithelial cells through a single application of self-replicating RNA (srRNA). The expression of pluripotency markers and the <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> as well as <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> trilineage differentiation were demonstrated. Furthermore, the resulting iPSCs contained no residual srRNA, and the karyotyping analysis demonstrated no detectable anomalies. The cardiac differentiation of these iPSCs resulted in autologous contracting cardiomyocytes after 10&#x000a0;days. We anticipate that the use of urine as a non-invasive cell source to obtain patient cells and the use of srRNA for reprogramming into iPSCs will greatly improve the future production of clinically applicable cardiomyocytes and other cell types. This could allow the regeneration of tissues by generating sufficient quantities of autologous cells without the risk of immune rejection.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>self-replicating RNA</kwd><kwd>reprogramming</kwd><kwd>iPSCs</kwd><kwd>urine</kwd><kwd>renal epithelial cells</kwd><kwd>cardiomyocytes</kwd><kwd>regenerative medicine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Heart failure is currently one of the leading causes of death and affects 23 million people worldwide.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> In addition to atrial fibrillation and arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction is a common cause of heart failure.

After 24&#x000a0;h and reaching approximately 50% confluency (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>D), a single transfection with 0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g OKSiM-GFP srRNA was performed for 4 h.

In this study, we established a method to generate footprint-free cardiomyocytes by using the autologous cell material from the patient&#x02019;s urine and srRNA. First, urine-derived human RECs were reprogrammed using srRNA into iPSCs and then differentiated into beating autologous cardiomyocytes. The obtained iPSCs showed self-renewability and the expression of pluripotency-specific markers, while no residual srRNA and genomic abnormalities were detected. The trilineage differentiation potential of REC-derived iPSCs was demonstrated <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> as well as <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic>. Moreover, the cardiac differentiation of these cells resulted in the generation of contractile cardiomyocytes. Thus, the results clearly demonstrated that autologous footprint-free iPSCs as well as cardiomyocytes can be obtained by using the patient&#x02019;s urine as a source for somatic cells. Thereby, invasive biopsies for isolation of somatic cells is not required. Since the obtained cells are footprint-free and autologous, they might have a high potential to be used for the regeneration of injured myocardium.</p><p id="p0095">Urine is a naturally excreted material; therefore, the sampling of patients&#x02019; urine offers an easy, non-invasive, low-cost, and pain-free method for the collection of sufficient numbers of human somatic cells for reprogramming. Due to natural physiological self-renewal of the epithelial tissue in the urinary tract, approximately 2,000 to 7,000 cells are daily detached and excreted with the urine.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> In urine, 3 types of epithelial cells can be found: renal, transitional, and squamous.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> RECs line the nephron as a single layer. An increased number of these cells in the urine can indicate an infection or kidney disease. Transitional epithelial cells are a multilayer of epithelial cells that line the urinary bladder. A few transitional cells are present in the urine of healthy persons, and increased numbers are associated with infection or transitional cell carcinoma. Most often, these cells are also found in the urine after urethral or ureteral catheterization. Squamous epithelial cells line the urethra and vagina, and this type of epithelial cells is most often found in female urine. Large numbers of squamous cells in female urine generally indicates vaginal contamination. However, during a culturing time of 3 to 5&#x000a0;days in renal epithelial proliferation medium, the squamous epithelial cells do not adhere to the cell culture plate and are removed after the medium change. Typically, 3 to 6 small colonies of RECs appear and grow steadily.</p><p id="p0100">In our study, 100&#x02013;200&#x000a0;mL urine was enough to obtain a sufficient amount of cells for the reprogramming procedure. However, by using an increased amount of urine, more cells could be obtained; thereby, the expansion time of the cells could be reduced. Furthermore, the proliferation rate of the cells can vary between different donors and ages and might influence the reprogramming efficiency. In this study, the isolated cells from urine samples were positive for the epithelial marker &#x003b2;-catenin and the renal proximal tubular marker CD13. In contrast to urine sampling, the commonly used somatic cells are obtained from skin samples (fibroblasts)<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> or blood cells<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> by invasive procedures. Cutting out healthy skin pieces is, of course, a painful procedure and is associated with the risk of infection. Furthermore, the reprogramming of blood cells is difficult, and the efficiency is known to be relatively low.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> It has also been shown that iPSCs derived from different cell sources maintain a distinct molecular pattern of epigenetic markers, which is linked to the donor tissue.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> This might result in the improved differentiation potential of iPSCs into the initial somatic cell type. In this study, the successful differentiation of urine-derived REC-iPSCs into cells of all three germline directions was demonstrated.</p><p id="p0105">The reprogramming was performed by a single transfection of RECs with a synthetic srRNA that encodes four reprogramming factors&#x02014;OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, and c-MYC&#x02014;as well as the fluorescent reporter protein GFP and contains an open reading frame for puromycin resistance. The puromycin resistance enables the positive selection of srRNA-containing cells, which improves the reprogramming efficiency. In comparison to viral-vector-based methods, the use of srRNA prevents random integration of reprogramming factors into the genome and enables the generation of footprint-free iPSCs. Furthermore, compared to the application of synthetic mRNA for the generation of iPSCs,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> which requires a daily transfection of 5 different mRNAs into the same target cell, a single transfection of cells with srRNA is sufficient for the complete reprogramming period.</p><p id="p0110">The addition of B18R protein into the reprogramming medium suppresses the type-I-interferon-associated immune responses<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> to the srRNA; thereby, the premature degradation of the srRNA in the cells can be prevented. After the reprogramming, the termination of B18R addition leads to the degradation of srRNA.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Furthermore, the incorporation of IRES-GFP into the srRNA allowed the control of successful transfection and translation of srRNA during the reprogramming process. Additionally, in the absence of the immunosuppressive protein B18R, the decrease of the fluorescence intensity indicated the degradation of the srRNA in the cells. Moreover, the implementation of qRT-PCR using specific primers for the nsP2 and nsP4 regions of the srRNA provided the evidence for the srRNA degradation, since, in obtained iPSCs (passage 3), no srRNA could be detected. The proto-oncogenes c-MYC and KLF4 are expressed in different types of cancer,<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> and the permanent overexpression of these genes is associated with an increased tumorigenesis.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Thus, although the expression of these proteins is required during the reprogramming, after the reprogramming, they should be downregulated. This was also demonstrated in our obtained iPSCs; the expression of c-MYC and KLF4 was not significantly different from the expression in precursor RECs. Furthermore, the decrease of c-MYC and KLF4 expression also indicates the degradation of the srRNA construct in the iPSCs.</p><p id="p0115">In addition to expressing certain proteins responsible for maintaining the pluripotency and the self-renewal capacity of iPSCs, another key feature of iPSCs is the ability to differentiate into each of the three germ layers: mesoderm, endoderm, and ectoderm. We successfully demonstrated the ability of the obtained iPSCs to form each of the germ layers after directed differentiation <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> as well as <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> after the application of iPSCs on CAM. Compared to the teratoma formation in mice, which is incubated for about 4&#x000a0;weeks, the application of 2&#x000a0;&#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> iPSCs on CAM and the incubation time of 10&#x000a0;days were sufficient to form all three germ layers. The cardiac differentiation of renal-epithelial-cell-derived iPSCs resulted already after 7&#x000a0;days in beating cardiomyocytes with a beating rate of approximately 25 beats per minute. The treatment of these cells with 0.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M nifidipine resulted in complete inhibition of beating. In contrast, the pharmacological modulation of REC-iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes with isoproterenol led to an increased beating rate.</p><p id="p0120">The future application of these cells for the repair of damaged heart tissues requires the production of pure cardiomyocyte cultures in a large-scale format and the selection of the appropriate subtype-specific cardiomyocytes&#x02014;nodal, atrial, or ventricular cardiomyocytes.<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Furthermore, the complete differentiation of iPSCs into mature cardiomyocytes should be ensured.<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Dubois et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> demonstrated by using an anti-SIRPA antibody and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) that cardiomyocytes can be enriched from human pluripotent stem cells.
