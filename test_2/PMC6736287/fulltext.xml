These MUT genes are highly induced in the presence of methanol, of which the induction mechanism has not been well understood. Heterologous protein expression systems have been established utilizing methanol-inducible promoters from MUT genes and are being used for production of biopharmaceutical proteins and industrial enzymes (Cereghino and Cregg <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Gellissen <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Macauley-Patrick <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Ahmad <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Yurimoto <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>).</p><p>Among methylotrophic yeasts, <italic>K. phaffii</italic> is by far the most utilized. A wide range of proteins from various origins&#x02014;from bacteria to human&#x02014;have been expressed in <italic>K. phaffii</italic>, especially using the <italic>AOX1</italic> promoter with methanol induction, at a yield from milligrams per liter of broth to over 20 g per liter of broth in high-cell-density fermentation (Cereghino and Cregg <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Gellissen <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Macauley-Patrick <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). However, methanol is a flammable chemical that can be hazardous to use at an industrial scale (Gellissen <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Ahmad <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). For industrial use, therefore, a methanol-free expression system is preferable. A strong constitutive promoter from the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (<italic>GAP</italic>) that does not require methanol induction is also used in <italic>K. phaffii</italic> for protein production (Cereghino and Cregg <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Macauley-Patrick <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Ahmad <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). However, protein yields using the <italic>GAP</italic> promoter reported so far are slightly inferior to the ones using the <italic>AOX1</italic> promoter with methanol. Moreover, unlike methanol inducible promoters, the <italic>GAP</italic> promoter is not controllable; therefore, it is not suitable for the production of proteins, which are toxic to the cells (Cereghino and Cregg <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Macauley-Patrick <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Ahmad <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Thus, the <italic>AOX1</italic> promoter with methanol induction is the most commonly used expression system for protein production in <italic>K. phaffii</italic> (Macauley-Patrick <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Ahmad <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>The regulation of the <italic>AOX1</italic> promoter consists of three steps (Vogl <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>): i) Repression by nonmethanol carbon sources, such as glucose, glycerol and ethanol. The <italic>AOX1</italic> promoter is tightly repressed by the presence of such repressive carbon sources. ii) De-repression through the depletion of repressive carbon source. Once the repressive carbon source is depleted, the <italic>AOX1</italic> promoter is weakly induced. iii) Methanol induction. The <italic>AOX1</italic> promoter is fully induced in the presence of methanol. Transcription factors responsible for i) are negative regulators while the ones responsible for ii) or iii) are positive regulators.</p><p>Transcription factors recognize specific DNA sequences (<italic>cis</italic>-elements) in the promoter of a targeted gene and bind it through the DNA binding domain to regulate the transcription of the gene. The DNA binding domain is classified into three domains, namely, the zinc-containing domain, such as C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger (Adr1 type) and Zn<sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>6</sub> zinc cluster (Gal4 type); helix-turn-helix (Mat&#x003b1;2 type); and the zipper-type domain (Gcn4 type) (Hahn and Young <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Activation or inactivation of the DNA binding of transcription factors could be controlled by other factors such as kinase, mediator and chaperon (Hahn and Young <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, Traven, Jelicic and Sopta <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). For instance, AMP-activated protein kinase Snf1 is essential for the DNA binding of Adr1p in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, which is a positive regulator for the catalytic pathway of nonfermentable sugar (de-repression) (Turcotte <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Hahn and Young <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Snf1 kinase also controls the activity of glucose repressor Mig1p by exporting it from nuclear to cytoplasm, resulting in de-repression (Klein, Olsson and Nielsen <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Turcotte <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In fact, Li <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) indicated that the AMPK/SNF1 pathway is likely to promote the activity of the <italic>AOX1</italic> promoter in <italic>K. phaffii</italic> via transcription factors and/or mediators.</p><p>Several transcription factors regulating MUT genes have been identified (Yurimoto, Oku and Sakai <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Vogl <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). <italic>C. boidinii</italic> has two positive regulators: Trm1p (Sasano <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) and Trm2p (Sasano <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>)&#x02014;the former is responsible for methanol induction and the latter likely responsible for de-repression, and one glucose repressor, Mig1p (Zhai, Yurimoto and Sakai <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), has been identified. In <italic>K. phaffii</italic>, Mxr1p (Lin-Cereghino <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) of Adr1 type and Prm1p (Takagi <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Wang <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>)/Trm1p (Sahu, Rao and Rangarajan <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and Mit1p (Wang <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>) of Gal4 type are known positive regulators for <italic>AOX1</italic> where the former is a regulator for de-repression and the latter is for methanol induction. Nrg1p (Wang <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2016a</xref>) is a glucose/glycerol repressor for <italic>AOX1</italic>, and Mig1p and Mig2p (Wang <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) are two homologues of glucose repressor Mig1p of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. However, how these transcription regulators interact with each other to regulate MUT genes has not been elucidated.</p><p>The expression of genes encoding transcription factors is also regulated by transcription factors, unless it is constitutive. It can be self-regulated (Sasano <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Wang <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>) or controlled by another transcription factor (Wang <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>). It is indicated that engineering the promoter region of transcription factor<strike>s</strike> could alter the induction condition of the transcription factor followed by altering the expression of entire genes under the regulation of the transcription factor. This was demonstrated previously using KpTrm1p, formerly Prm1p, at the first time (Takagi <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>A couple of methanol-independent expression systems based on the <italic>AOX1</italic> promoter were successfully established in <italic>K. phaffii</italic> by altering the promoter of positive regulators, namely, Mit1p and Mxr1p. Their promoters were replaced with a <italic>CAT</italic> promoter (Vogl <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) or an <italic>AOX2</italic> promoter (Chang <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>); both work under carbon depleted (de-repressed) conditions without methanol. Both systems outperformed standard production with methanol &#x0003e;2-fold on model proteins. Replacing the promoter of <italic>MIT1</italic> with a constitutive <italic>GAP</italic> promoter and deletion of glucose repressors Mig1p/Mig2p/Nrg1p were combined with a carbon source shifting fermentation from glucose to glycerol to induce the <italic>AOX1</italic> promoter (Wang <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Also, it was discovered that deleting two kinases&#x02014;&#x00394;<italic>gut1</italic> or &#x00394;<italic>dak</italic>&#x02014;induces the <italic>AOX1</italic> promoter with nonmethanol carbon sources (Shen <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). However, these systems reached protein productivity at 50&#x02013;60% of methanol induction.</p><p>There are a couple of examples showing that the multiplication of an Upstream Activation Sequence (UAS) containing the <italic>cis</italic>-element of a positive transcription factor enhanced the induction of the promoter (Ohi <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Minetoki <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Ohi <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>) reported that multiplying the UAS of the <italic>AOX2</italic> promoter by three copies increased the production of human serum albumin (HAS) in <italic>K. phaffii</italic> over 50 times. In a fungus <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic>, 12 tandem repeats of region III, which is a conserved region among amylase genes in <italic>A. oryzae</italic>, increased the expression of the <italic>agdA</italic> promoter &#x0003e;20-fold (Minetoki <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report on our attempt to develop a methanol-free expression system of <italic>K. phaffii</italic>, using another strong methanol-inducible <italic>DAS1</italic> promoter through engineering its transcription factors, namely KpTrm1p, which was applied to the production of an industrial enzyme in high-cell-density fermentation. Multiplication of the UAS of the <italic>DAS1</italic> promoter was also tested in order to increase enzyme productivity with and without methanol. We also discuss our findings on the difference in the regulation of the <italic>AOX1</italic> promoter and the <italic>DAS1</italic> promoter by known transcription factors in <italic>K. phaffii</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec3"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Strains, vectors and media</title><p>

Fermentation was conducted in 5 L-fermenters (ABLE Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) starting with 2 liters of basal medium (85% H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 26.7 mL/L, CaSO<sub>4.</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O 1.1 g/L, K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> 18.2 g/L, MgSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O 14.9 g/L, KOH 4.1 g/L, glycerol 40.0 g/L). Strains were pre-cultured in 110 mL of YPD at 30&#x000b0;C for 1 day, then transferred to the basal medium supplemented with PTM<sub>1</sub> Trace Salts (Invitrogen). The fermentation was controlled at 30&#x000b0;C, pH above 5.0 and keeping dissolved oxygen (DO) level over 30% by adjusting agitation speed. Glycerol feeding started at 12 hours and the feeding rate was increased step-by-step until 40 hours. When the DO level decreased below 10%, feeding was stopped until the DO recovered. In the case of the methanol fermentation, methanol feeding was started at 40 hours. The methanol-feeding rate after 41 hours was adjusted aiming to maintain the methanol concentration in the medium at 0.8%. When the DO level decreased below 20%, methanol feeding was stopped until the DO recovered and then the feeding rate was decreased to keep DO level over 20%. In the case of glucose fermentation, initial carbon source in the basal medium and feeding substrate was glucose instead of glycerol. Glucose feeding started at 12 hours and feeding rate was increased step-by-step until 40 hours. After 40 hours, the feeding rate was controlled to keep the DO level between 10&#x02013;30%. Residual glucose in the medium was usually below 0.2 g/L after &#x0223c;70 hours. Dried cell weight (DCW) was measured as follows; &#x0223c;2 mL of culture broth was transferred to a pre-weighed glass tube and the tube was again weighed to calculate a weight of the whole broth. Cells were collected from the broth by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 10 minutes, then washed twice with Reverse Osmosis (RO) water. After discarding the washed water, cells in the tube were dried in drying oven at 105&#x000b0;C for at least 24 hours. After cooling in a desiccator, the tube was weighed to calculate the weight of dried cells. Dried cell weight (DCW/g) was obtained as a quotient of the weight of dried cells divided by the weight of whole broth.

We expected that the expression driven by the promoter of the MUT gene could be controllable via the engineering of this transcription factor (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>) and the constitutive expression plasmid pGPrm was constructed (Takagi <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).

Phytase productivity was evaluated by cultivating cells in shaking flasks with YPD medium for 2 to 3 days without adding methanol. Under the tested conditions, glucose in the medium was used up within 2 to 3 days, which means that the late stage of cultivation was under glucose depleted condition. As the results show, reference strains AOX94 and DAS40 produced very little phytase, while the derived strains co-expressing constitutive <italic>KpTRM1</italic> with pGPrm showed significantly higher phytase activity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>).

Plasmid pGMxr expressing <italic>MXR1</italic> constitutively with a GAP promoter was introduced into the same reference strains, AOX94 and DAS40, and tested in a similar manner. Interestingly, unlike KpTrm1p, the effect of Mxr1p on the <italic>DAS1</italic> promoter was negligible, while its effect on the <italic>AOX1</italic> promoter was more significant than the effect of KpTrm1p (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>). Considering that Mxr1p is a presumed positive regular working under de-repressed conditions, the obtained results were consistent with findings in <italic>C. boidinii</italic> (Yurimoto and Sakai <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), which showed that the <italic>AOD1</italic> (<italic>AOX1</italic> homologue) promoter was partially activated under de-repressed conditions without methanol feeding, while the <italic>DAS1</italic> promoter was not activated under de-repressed conditions and required the addition of methanol. Yurimoto, Oku and Sakai (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) indicated that the induction of the <italic>DAS1</italic> promoter was mainly achieved with methanol-specific induction by Trm1p in <italic>C. boidinii</italic>, although the de-repression by Trm2p was necessary for the induction of this promoter. Thus, the contribution of Trm2p (Mxr1p homologue) to the methanol-specific induction of the <italic>DAS1</italic> promoter was smaller than that of Trm1p in <italic>C. boidinii</italic>. Our results suggest that it is probably the same in <italic>K. phaffii</italic>, i.e. the <italic>DAS1</italic> promoter is mainly activated by methanol-induction specific KpTrm1p, and Mxr1p alone does not induce the <italic>DAS1</italic> promoter (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>). Whether Mxr1p was necessary for KpTrm1p to activate the <italic>DAS1</italic> promoter was not conclusively established, because the tested fermentation conditions provided glucose-depleted conditions in the late stage of fermentation, which could activate endogenous Mxr1p. This remains to be confirmed by further research.</p><p>In the case of the <italic>AOX1</italic> promoter, co-expression of constitutive Mxr1p was three times more effective than KpTrm1p in a methanol-free condition (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>). However, the yield was still &#x0003e;10 times less than the yield with methanol induction (data not shown), which indicates that another important regulator exists for the <italic>AOX1</italic> promoter. Wang (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and Vogl <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) reported that overexpression of Mit1p, another positive regulator of the Gal4 type, was more effective than KpTrm1p (Prm1p) on the methanol-independent expression of <italic>AOX1</italic> in <italic>K. phaffii</italic> (<italic>P. pastoris</italic>). Their results indicate that Mit1p is the true methanol-induction-specific regulator for <italic>AOX1</italic>, rather than KpTrm1p. Wang (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>) reported that KpTrm1p (Prm1p) binds the promoter of <italic>MIT1</italic> to activate its expression in the presence of methanol and suggested that KpTrm1 could be a receptor of the methanol signal and transfers it to <italic>MIT1</italic>. The results showed that KpTrm1p was still an important regulator for the <italic>AOX1</italic> promoter under methanol induction. This suggests that the regulation of the <italic>AOX1</italic> promoter is more complex and involves multiple regulators, while the regulation of the <italic>DAS1</italic> promoter is simpler and involves fewer regulators. Our work did not produce new findings about the effect of glucose repression factors Mig1p/Mig2p/Nrg1p (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>) on the <italic>DAS1</italic> promoter; however, it is known that Mig1p in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is inactivated by Snf1 kinase in glucose-depleted conditions (Klein, Olsson and Nielsen <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). At the same time, Snf1 likely activates Adr1 under the same conditions (Turcotte <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).

Similarly, pDd-4, in which the region between &#x02212;755 and &#x02212;655 was deleted, increased phytase yield by 28% compared with pDd-3. Results indicated that these regions contained an upstream repression sequence (URS) and deletion of the URS increased phytase expression. Ohi <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>) reported a similar finding, namely that two URSs existed in the <italic>AOX2</italic> promoter of <italic>K. phaffii</italic> (<italic>P. pastoris</italic>), at around &#x02212;645 and &#x02212;255, and that removing or mutating these URSs increased the expression level dramatically.</p><p>Further deletion work successfully identified the region at &#x02212;355 to &#x02212;255 as essential to the methanol induction of the <italic>DAS1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Figure S3B</xref>, Supporting Information). The region was named UAS1<sub>DAS1</sub>. Sasano et al. (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) reported that two methanol response elements&#x02014;MRE1 (<italic>CCTATTCCAAAAAGGG</italic>) and MRE2 (<italic>TGCATTCCTAAAATAG</italic>)&#x02014;existed in the <italic>DAS1</italic> promoter of <italic>C. boidinii</italic> and that MRE1 was closely related to the induction by Trm1p. Similar sequences were identified in the UAS1<sub>DAS1</sub> in <italic>K. phaffii</italic>, termed PBS1 and PBS2, and their deletion was examined (Tsutsumi and Takagi <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Deletion of PBS1 or PBS2 reduced the expression level by 25% and 75%, respectively. The impact of the deletion of each region, however, was smaller than the impact of the deletion of entire UAS1<sub>DAS1</sub>. It was decided to use the whole UAS<sub>DAS1</sub> for further engineering work.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-5"><title>Engineering of the <italic>DAS1</italic> promoter: amplification of UAS1<sub>DAS1</sub></title><p>The amplification of UAS1<sub>DAS1</sub> was tested using the truncated version of the <italic>DAS1</italic> promoter, without URS.

Plasmids generated with this construction were integrated at the <italic>HIS4</italic> locus of host strain GS115 in single copy and tested for phytase production with methanol in a shaking flask test.

It was over twofold higher than the reference with pNo-DP3. Selected strain 28-2, generated with pDd-28, was evaluated in high-cell-density fermentations with methanol induction and compared with strain 2-3 carrying pDd-2. The phytase yield of 28-2 was 40% higher than that of strain 2-3 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>).

The plasmid pGPrm was introduced into phytase-producing strains generated with the plasmids pDd-14&#x0223c;pDd-20, and methanol-free enzyme production was studied in shaking flasks (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). As expected, none of the strains without co-expression of pGPrm produced phytase with glucose; therefore, the observed phytase activities resulted from constitutively-expressed KpTrm1p. Interestingly, strains generated with the plasmid in which UAS1<sub>DAS1</sub> had been deleted (pDd-14 and pDd-20) showed higher phytase activity than the plasmids maintaining UAS1<sub>DAS1</sub> (pPd-17&#x0223c;19). The results suggest that UAS1<sub>DAS1</sub> was not a <italic>cis</italic>-element of KpTrm1p for activating the <italic>DAS1</italic> promoter in the tested methanol-free expression system. This unexpected result indicated that there must be another element in the <italic>DAS1</italic> promoter for KpTrm1p to interact with. Careful analysis revealed that the region between &#x02212;455 and &#x02212;355 was more important to maximizing the effect of KpTrm1p (pDd-14, 19 and 20, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The region was named ESP<sub>DAS1</sub>, enhancing sequence for KpTrm1p (Prm1p). In fact, strains carrying these plasmids, except 19P-13 with pDd-19, showed similar levels of phytase productivity to DPrm11 carrying the wild type <italic>DAS1</italic> promoter. The reason for the lower yield of 19P-13 is not known, but it might be related to the region deleted in plasmid pDd-19.

Selected strain 28P-14, derived from strain 28-2, and strain 2P-4, derived from reference strain 2-3, were evaluated in high-cell-density fermentations under methanol-free conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). As expected, there was no significant difference between phytase expressions with these two strains, confirming that the UAS1<sub>DAS1</sub> does not interact with KpTrm1p in the tested methanol-free fermentation. Interestingly, the phytase yields obtained with these two strains were three times higher than the previously constructed DPrm11 derived from strain DAS40, carrying pNo-DP3 with the original <italic>DAS1</italic> promoter of 1-kb for phytase expression. This might be because the truncated version of the <italic>DAS1</italic> promoter was used for the construction of pDd-2 and pDd-28. One possible reason could be that the removed &#x02212;855&#x0223c;&#x02212;1055 region contained URS&#x02014;which affects the promoter activity negatively, even without methanol. Glucose repression could be an example of such a negative effect, which would have a significant impact, especially in glucose fermentation. Ohi <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>), however, reported that neither of the identified URSs, URS1 (&#x02212;645&#x0223c;&#x02212;684) and URS2 (&#x02212;255&#x0223c;&#x02212;215), in the <italic>AOX2</italic> promoter were involved in catabolite repression, and the mechanism of their repressing effect was not defined. Another possible reason for the yield increase could be the integration locus of the expression plasmid. In the case of 2-3 and 28-2, plasmids pDd-2 and pDd-28 were integrated at the <italic>HIS4</italic> locus, while in the case of DAS40, pNo-DP3 was integrated at the <italic>DAS1</italic> promoter region. To elucidate mechanisms of improvement, further experiments are awaited. Nevertheless, the newly developed methanol-free expression system based on a truncated version of the <italic>DAS1</italic> promoter produced 25% more phytase than the system based on the <italic>GAP</italic> promoter (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). It was the highest yield of phytase achieved in methanol-free conditions.
