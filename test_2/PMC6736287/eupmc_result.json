    "The construction of a methanol-free expression system of Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris) was attempted by engineering a strong methanol-inducible DAS1 promoter using Citrobacter braakii phytase production as a model case. Constitutive expression of KpTRM1, formerly PRM1-a positive transcription regulator for methanol-utilization (MUT) genes of K. phaffii,was demonstrated to produce phytase without addition of methanol, especially when a DAS1 promoter was used but not an AOX1 promoter. Another positive regulator, Mxr1p, did not have the same effect on the DAS1 promoter, while it was more effective than KpTrmp1 on the AOX1 promoter. Removing a potential upstream repression sequence (URS) and multiplying UAS1DAS1 in the DAS1 promoter significantly enhanced the yield of C. braakii phytase with methanol-feeding, which surpassed the native AOX1 promoter by 80%. However, multiplying UAS1DAS1 did not affect the yield of methanol-free expression by constitutive KpTrm1p. Another important region to enhance the effect of KpTrm1p under a methanol-free condition was identified in the DAS1 promoter, and was termed ESPDAS1. Nevertheless, methanol-free phytase production using an engineered DAS1 promoter outperformed phytase production with the GAP promoter by 25%. Difference in regulation by known transcription factors on the AOX1 promoter and the DAS1 promoter was also illustrated."
