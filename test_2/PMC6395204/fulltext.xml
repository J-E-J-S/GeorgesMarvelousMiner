Japanese islands and has impacted on the island&#x02019;s biodiversity. Population control has
been attempted through capturing but its efficiency has rapidly declined. Therefore, new
additional control methods are required. Our focus has been on the immunocontraceptive
vaccines, which act in an especially species-specific manner. The amino-acid sequence of
the mongoose ovum zona pellucida protein 3 (ZP3) was decoded and two types of synthetic
peptides (A and B) were produced. In this study, these peptides were administered to
mongooses (each n=3) and the sera were collected to verify immunogenicity using ELISA and
IHC. Treated mongoose sera showed an increasing of antibody titer according to
immunizations and the antigen-antibody reactions against the endogenous mongoose ZP. In
addition, IHC revealed that immune sera absorbed with each peptide showed a marked
reduction in reactivity, which indicated the specificity of induced antibodies. These
reactions were marked in peptide A treated mongoose sera, and the antibody titer of one of
them lasted for at least 21 weeks. These results indicated that peptide A was a potential
antigen, inducing autoantibody generation. Moreover, immunized rabbit antibodies
recognized mongoose ZP species-specifically. However, the induction of robust immune
memory was not observed. Also, the actual sterility effects of peptides remain unknown, it
should be verified as a next step. In any case, this study verified synthetic peptides we
developed are useful as the antigen candidates for immunocontraception of mongooses.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>fertility control</kwd><kwd>immunocontraception</kwd><kwd>invasive alien species</kwd><kwd>mongoose</kwd><kwd>zona pellucida</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The small Indian mongoose (<italic>Herpestes auropunctatus</italic>) is a carnivorous animal
mainly native to the region expanding from West to Southeast Asia [<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The mongoose is listed
among the &#x0201c;100 of the World&#x02019;s Worst Invasive Alien Species&#x0201d; published by the invasive species
specialist group of the IUCN [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This is the result
of introducing the small Indian mongoose intentionally to 76 islands throughout the world,
which has threatened the native ecosystems [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In Japan,
ten-odd individuals of the small Indian mongoose were introduced to Okinawa Island in Japan in
1910 and brought in Amami-oshima Island in 1979, with the aim of biologically controlling Habu
snakes and house rats [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>Okinawa Island and Amami-oshima Island are both located in the sub-tropical region, which has
endemic ecosystems and uniquely evolved fauna. The lack of remarkable natural enemies and the
comfortable climate easily allowed the mongoose population to establish its habitat and
spread, which resulted in a large impact on the island&#x02019;s biodiversity. Specifically, preying
on the Amami rabbit (<italic>Pentalagus furnessi</italic>), Ryukyu long-furred rat
(<italic>Diplothrix legata</italic>), Ryukyu robin (<italic>Erithacus komadori</italic>),
Ryukyu tree lizard (<italic>Japalura polygonata</italic>), and other rare species, and the
competition with species that prey on the same food resources such as Okinawa rail
(<italic>Gallirallus okinawae</italic>) largely impacted the islands [<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Not only impacts on
ecosystems but also social impacts such as risk of leptospirosis transmission and damage to
poultry by mongooses were reported [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>The Ministry of the Environment Government of Japan (MOE) has conducted control of mongoose
on both islands in cooperation with the local governments, starting from the year 2000 [<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Further, An Invasive Alien Species Act was carried out
in 2005, and small Indian mongoose was legally designated as an invasive alien species in
Japan [<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The MOE organized a group of experts in
mongoose capturing called &#x0201c;Mongoose Busters&#x0201d; on each island and have succeeded in reducing the
mongoose population drastically [<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However,
achieving a low mongoose population density has also lowered the capture efficiency.
Therefore, the complete eradication of the mongoose population is not yet to be achieved. The
other factors suppressing the capture efficiency are the increase in by-catch of native
species and the appearance of trap-shy individuals, who are highly cautious of traps.</p><p>Therefore, new methods for mongoose population control are required. We focused on the
immunocontraceptive methods, which induce immunological sterility by treatment with
contraceptive vaccines. Immunocontraception in wildlife was initially established in 1980s to
control wild horses in the U.S.A. [<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and has since been applied to various mammals (e.g.,
cat, African elephant, and some ungulates), due to a growing concern for animal welfare [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Immunocontraception is a technique for suppressing
reproduction of the target species, in which antibodies induced by the contraceptive vaccines
inhibit the activity of reproduction-related factors as autoantigens. In these studies,
nonspecies-specific agents such as porcine zona pellucida (PZP) or GnRH preparations, some of
which have already been made into products (e.g., SpayVac<sup>TM</sup>, GonaCon<sup>TM</sup>),
have been used as direct injectable contraceptive vaccines [<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. On the other hand, species-specific agents have also been developed with remote
injection to control the free-ranging population [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Since the present study targeted on free-ranging
invasive animals, it was not realistic to treat mongooses with any direct injectable agents
under visual recognition or capture. Furthermore, the effects on non-target species had to be
minimized. Therefore, the overall objective of this study was to develop mongoose-specific
immunocontraceptive agents.</p><p>We focused on zona pellucida 3 glycoprotein (ZP3) as vaccine antigens, which has high
species-specificity and plays an important role in the primary binding of sperms and oocytes
[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].
Manufacturing of vaccine candidates was necessary to clarify whether these agents would induce
antibody production in mongoose and whether, the induced antibody, would recognize the
mongoose endogenous zona pellucida (ZP) as biological antigens. Additionally, we tried to
identify the species-specific effects of these peptides.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Synthesis of antigen peptides</title><p>We started by decoding the full-length sequence of mongoose ZP3. Briefly, RNA was
extracted from mongoose ovary, sampled from individuals culled in MOE control program. PCR
products were obtained with reverse transcriptase reaction method and RACE method;
RACE-PCR products were then amplified by TA cloning. After the sequence reaction, base
sequence analysis was performed by the Division of Genomics Research of Life Science
Research Center of Gifu University. Thereafter, amino-acid sequences were predicted from
the decoded mongoose ZP3 gene sequence and homology of the sperm-oocyte binding site was
compared with known ZP3 sequences from cat (<italic>Felis silvestris catus</italic>), dog
(<italic>Canis lupus familiaris</italic>), stoat (<italic>Mustela ermine</italic>),
mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>), and humans (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>).</p><p>Through the above steps, two types of peptides, namely peptide A (CGLPGHSRRLSHPERPRRK)
and peptide B (CHPERPRRKLAPRSRNRRH), which have a homologous amino-acid sequence to a part
of the mongoose ZP3 sperm-oocyte binding site (both 19 AA residues) were designed. These
peptides were synthesized and conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) on the
cysteine residue in order to promote antigenicity (Sigma-Aldrich Japan K.K.; Tokyo,
Japan). Each peptide was assumed to include two epitope regions. One of them has common
amino-acid sequence between peptide A and B.</p></sec><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Nine female small Indian mongooses were captured in Nago city, Okinawa using box traps in
the MOE mongoose control project [<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. They were
all determined as mature by their head/body length (265&#x02013;290 mm) and body weight (275&#x02013;487
g) [<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The animals were acclimatized to captivity
for at least 2 weeks, and were housed in individual cages (L 230 &#x000d7; H 270 &#x000d7; W 600 mm) in
the outdoor rearing facility at the Yambaru wildlife conservation center of MOE. All
animals were fed dog food and had free access to water at all times. The mongooses were
randomly assigned to three groups: group A, which received peptide A (n=3; A-1~3), group
B, which received peptide B (n=3; B-1~3), and control group C treated with
phosphate-buffer saline (PBS; n=3; C-1~3). No animals showed noticeable body weight loss
or behavioral abnormality during the experiment.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunization and blood sampling</title><p>Starting from February 2014, the animals were treated with peptides (150
<italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/150 <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic>) emulsified with the same volume of Freund&#x02019;s
incomplete adjuvant (TiterMax<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gold, TiterMax U.S.A. Inc., Norcross, GA,
U.S.A.) or 150 <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic> of PBS with the same volume of adjuvant as control
under anesthesia. Immunization was performed four times at an interval of 2 weeks in
several dorsal subcutaneous sites. Two of the animals (A-1 and B-2) were used for the
confirmation of the antibody&#x02019;s durability. Subsequently, after a decrease in the antibody
titer (83 weeks after the first immunization), these two animals were treated with a
single immunization to evaluate the immune memory. The mongooses were anesthetized with
intramuscular injection of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/head; Ketalar, Daiichi Sankyo,
Tokyo, Japan) and medetomidine hydrochloride (0.07 mg/head; Domitor, Nippon Zenyaku Kogyo
Co., Ltd., Fukushima, Japan) using a special box cage. Subsequently, the animals were
treated with atipamezole hydrochloride (0.35 mg/head; Antisedan, Nippon Zenyaku Kogyo Co.,
Ltd.) to promote recovery from sedation. Blood (1 m<italic>l</italic>) was collected via
cardiocentesis at the time of immunization (except the second immunization) and a week
after the fourth immunization. Blood samples from A-1 and B-2 were collected continuously
at an interval of approximately 15 weeks and at the time of reimmunization. Blood samples
were kept overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, and were subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm,
and the serum was separated. All serum samples were subdivided and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until
further analysis. All animals, except A-1 and B-2 were euthanized 1 week after the last
immunization via exsanguination under anesthesia, and the ovaries were collected for
pathological analysis. Euthanasia was performed in accordance with the guideline of The
American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA; 2007).</p></sec><sec><title>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)</title><p>The amount of serum antibodies against synthetic peptides was measured by using indirect
ELISA. Briefly, 96-well microplates (#3590, Corning Inc., Corning, NY, U.S.A.) were coated
with 100 <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic> of peptide A or B in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (C3041,
Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature.
After washing three times with 200&#x02013;300 <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic>/well of PBS containing 0.05%
Tween<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>20 (Sigma-Aldrich; PBS-T), nonspecificity was blocked with 3% skim milk
in PBS (200 <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic>/well) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. After washing three times with
PBS-T, mongoose serum in PBS (1:100; 100 <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic>/well) was added as the
primary antibody and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. After washing three times
with PBS-T (300&#x02013;400 <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic>/well), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat
anti-Ferret IgG antibody (1:2,500; 1 mg/m<italic>l</italic>; Bethyl laboratories Inc.,
Montgomery, AL, U.S.A.) in PBS (100 <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic>/well) was added and incubated for
1 hr at room temperature; cross-reactivity to mongoose IgG has been previously reported
[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. After washing three times with PBS-T
(200&#x02013;300 <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic>/well), tetramethyl benzidine (100 <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic>/well;
TMB Substrate Regent Set, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, U.S.A.) was added to induce a
chromogenic reaction for 20 min, and the reaction was subsequently stopped by 1 M of
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The absorbance was measured at dual wavelengths, 450/655 nm
using a microplate reader (Model 680, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, U.S.A.).</p><p>All sera were tested in triplicate on a plate to verify the technical validity of the
experiment, and the average optical density (OD) and standard deviation (SD) of sera were
calculated. An average OD + 3 SD of all control sera was set as the cut-off value.</p></sec><sec><title>IHC&#x02013;labeled streptavidin-biotin (LSAB) method</title><p>Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on sections (4 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>m) from fixed
and paraffin-embedded non-immunized mongoose ovaries obtained from three mature female
mongooses, other than from immunized individuals, captured under the same MOE control
program, to verify the recognition of endogenous ZP by induced mongoose antibodies.
Mongooses were then euthanized under anesthesia by exsanguination and ovaries were
collected and fixed in 4% neutral buffered formalin.</p><p>According to the general methods, sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated using
xylene and alcohol gradient. At this stage, one section was used for hematoxylin and eosin
staining (HE) to observe the tissue structure. For IHC, antigen retrieval was performed in
other sections by incubating them in citrate buffer solution (pH 5.4) in a warm bath
(90&#x000b0;C) for 40 min. After cooling down for 20 min at room temperature, sections were washed
three times with PBS (5 min), and the endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited with 3%
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 15 min at room temperature. After washing three times
with PBS (5 min), the slides were treated with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA; A3590,
Sigma-Aldrich Co.) in PBS (100 <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic>/section) and incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C
to block nonspecific reactions. Subsequently, the sections were incubated with primary
antibody, i.e., either serum from the treated mongooses, diluted at 1:50 with 3% BSA in
PBS (100 <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic>/section) for 1 hr at room temperature. After washing three
times with PBS (5 min), the sections were incubated with HRP-labeled protein A (1:1,000,
100 <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic>/section; ab7456, Abcam, Cambridge, U.K.) for 1 hr at room
temperature. After washing in PBS, sections were incubated with streptavidin (1:200, 100
<italic>&#x000b5;l</italic>/section; Extravidin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) in PBS for 1 hr
at room temperature to amplify the avidin-biotin reaction. Subsequently, the sections were
washed in PBS, incubated in 3,3&#x002b9;-diaminobenzidin (DAB; Dako, Santa Clara, CA, U.S.A.) for
1 min to induce a chromogenic reaction, and counterstained with hematoxylin. All slides
were sealed through a dehydrating and permeating operation.</p><p>To evaluate the specificity of the antibody, an absorption test was performed, in which
absorbed sera with immunized peptide (e.g., A-1 serum-peptide A) were used as the primary
antibody. Each serum and the same volume of peptide were co-incubated in PBS (1:50
diluent) for 1 hr at room temperature.</p><p>Additionally, to estimate the species-specificity of antibodies induced by peptides, IHC
using immunized rabbit sera and ovary sections of various animals was performed. Briefly,
the same peptides (peptide A or B) were administrated to rabbits (each n=2; a-1, 2 and
b-1, 2) 5 times every two weeks and sera were collected continuously. Immunized rabbit
sera were used as the primary antibody (1:100 with 3% BSA in PBS, 100
<italic>&#x000b5;l</italic>/section). Ovary sections from Mongoose, Japanese marten
(<italic>Martes melampus melampus</italic>), cat (<italic>Felis silvestris
catus</italic>), dog (<italic>Canis lupus familiaris</italic>), Japanese wild boar
(<italic>Sus scrofa</italic>), and rabbit (<italic>Oryctolagus cuniculus</italic>) were
used (fixed with 4% neutral buffered formalin, 4 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>m). Ovary samples were
collected from spayed cats and dogs, captured wild animals based on permission, and
experimental animals. Every captured or experimental animal were euthanized in accordance
with the guideline of AVMA appropriately and ovaries from them were treated as ones from
mongooses. Other experimental conditions were the same as described above.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Comparisons of ZP3 homology between mongoose and the other animals</title><p>Decoded base sequence of mongoose ZP3 reached 1,278 bp and it is assumed to be translated

than in those immunized with peptide B (results not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>According to the ELISA results, the immune response to the synthetic peptides A and B was
confirmed in mongooses. Since peptides without KLH conjugation were used as a coated
antigen, the induced antibodies were considered as the specific reactions against each
peptide rather than the carrier protein. The capacity of peptide A to induce antibodies
seemed to be superior to that of peptide B, even though these two synthetic peptides were
suspected to include a common epitope sequence. However, there is a possibility that another
epitope region in peptide A may be relatively excellent in the antigen presentation capacity
of the immune system of mongoose.</p><p>The longevity of the antibody titers was at least 21 and 7 weeks in A-1 and B-2,
respectively. Moreover, peptide A exhibited a longer antigenicity than peptide B. Abe (1995)
reported that the life span of small Indian mongoose is 2 years or less in Amami-oshima
Island [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], while the female estrus season spans
mainly from March to August and generally occurs at 1 year of age [<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Considering these reproductive biological characterizations, a
single immunization by an 5-month lasting vaccine in spring would be applicable to keep the
antibody titer for a most of breeding season. However, it must be noted that these results
occurred after multiple direct immunizations of an antigen peptide amplified antigenicity
and not suggested longevity of fertility suppressive effects furthermore in the oral
vaccination. Prolongations of the lifespan and/or the breeding season were also reported in
some species treated with contraceptive vaccines [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>];
hence, the effect of increased longevity and breeding season on the duration of the
contraceptive effect would have to be considered.</p><p>We did not observe any significant results in the immune memory test to be able to judge
whether the immune memory had been induced. It is worth noting that the induction of immune
memory is nonessential but helpful to solid fertility control. The immune memory may be
improved by variations of the vaccination route or by additional modification of the antigen
agents [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Although not shown, no inflammation or other histological disorders were observed in the
ovary tissues of all treated animals. The peptides evaluated in this study did not seem to
affect the ovary or oocytes histologically, although previous studies have indicated the
presence or absence of ovaritis [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The
correlation between ovaritis and contraceptive effect is still unknown, while absence of
disorders is important from the perspective of animal welfare [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Although considered invasive alien species, the pain attendant on
treatment should be minimized [<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>It is well established that ZP consists of three to four types of glycoproteins containing
a ZP module (ZP 1&#x02013;4); it is synthesized by oocytes from the secondary follicle period and is
post-translationally modified with a sugar chain [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, ZP3 is a principal glycoprotein
that is implicated in the primary binding of sperms and has a high species-specificity
[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].
Antibodies induced by treatment with synthesized ZP3 peptides bound to mongoose ZP, and
recognized ZP at every stage of follicles forming ZP. Moreover, these antigen-antibody
responses were specific based on the experiment using antibodies absorbed with antigen
peptides. These results indicated that the exogenous antigens stimulated a specific
<italic>in vivo</italic> response to endogenous ZP proteins in the mongooses, and that the
ZP3 epitope regions targeted by the antibodies are expressed from an early ZP stage, which
is unsusceptible to its maturation. Ideally, control sera in the absorption test should be
co-incubated with unrelated peptide to immunization. However, all sera were diluted with a
blocking solution that contained more miscellaneous proteins. Thus, the possibility that the
peptide solution impeded the antigen-antibody responses nonspecifically would be
rejected.</p><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Summarized the results of ELISA and histological analysis</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" align="center" valign="middle" colspan="1">Group name (treatment)</th><th rowspan="3" align="center" valign="middle" colspan="1">Individual No.</th><th colspan="2" align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1">Antibody titer (absorbance at 450&#x02013;655 nm)</th><th rowspan="3" align="center" valign="middle" colspan="1">Reactibity<break/>in IHC</th><th rowspan="3" align="center" valign="middle" colspan="1">Pathological<break/>findings</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre-immuned</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Immuned (4 times)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Group A (peptide A)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A-1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.231 &#x000b1; 0.017</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.922 &#x000b1; 0.067</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ND</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A-2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.242 &#x000b1; 0.021</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.548 &#x000b1; 0.079</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+++</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A-3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.244 &#x000b1; 0.011</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.056 &#x000b1; 0.052</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Group B (peptide B)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">B-1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.208 &#x000b1; 0.004</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.637 &#x000b1; 0.012</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">B-2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.229 &#x000b1; 0.013</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.689 &#x000b1; 0.001</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000b1;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ND</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">B-3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.262 &#x000b1; 0.026</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.442 &#x000b1; 0.009</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Group C (control)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">C-1</td><td align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">0.257 &#x000b1; 0.004 (peptide A)/0.254 &#x000b1; 0.019 (peptide

correlation between the treated groups in the strength of the reaction in both assays,
within group variation; for example, the A-1 serum showed the highest antibody titer in
ELISA and the second strongest response in IHC. These discrepancies may be due to the
differences of the target antigen or the other conditions between ELISA and IHC. The
combination of tissues and primary antibodies originating from the same tissue species,
i.e., mongoose-mongoose, should be avoided in IHC. The secondary antibodies also bind to
endogenous immunoglobulin, which results in nonspecific reactions [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, immune sera had high specificity to mongoose ZP enough. In
addition, by appropriately adjusting the dilution concentration and incubation condition of
the sera and secondary antibodies, the nonspecific reactions were minimized and the specific
reactions were potentiated.</p><p>The synthetic peptides used in this study, especially peptide A, seemed useful as vaccine
candidates. As a next step, we have to evaluate the actual fertility suppressive effect of
the peptides. Only after a successful inhibition of pregnancy may we discuss whether the
quantity of the antibody titer is effective or not. Although it has not been explained
completely, the actual inhibitory pathway for fertilization by immunocontraception is
assumed to be the immune response against the oocytes in follicles and/or ovulated [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Nevertheless, there is likely to be a correlation
between the antibody titer and the fertilization suppressive effect. However, a previous
immunocontraceptive study in mice has reported no correlation between them [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Immunized rabbit sera with the same synthetic peptides showed mongoose-specific responses
in IHC using ovary tissues of various animals, including rabbit. This result may mean a
certain species-specificity of synthetic peptides. However, actual specificity of
contraceptive effect should be mentioned after it has been proved that these synthetic
peptides do not affect any animals other than mongoose. On that account, it has to be
confirmed by the vaccination of synthetic peptides to various species; especially sympatric
animals with mongoose in Japan. Rare species that are difficult to use for experiments are
included within them. So, there is a necessity for obtaining a suitable permission or using
some experimental animals as a substitute for them.</p><p>Remarkable differences in the immune response between animals were not observed in this
small-scale study. However, the individual differences in the immune response possibility
have a negative impact on the fertility control in the mongoose population. Selection
pressure will be applied on the mongooses&#x02019; acquired resistance to the fertility suppressive
effects of contraceptive vaccines, which can lead the dominant character of the mongoose
population to vaccine resistance [<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. To avoid such
&#x0201c;adverse effects of immunocontraceptive vaccines&#x0201d;, we have to identify the frequency of
appearance of individuals potentially resistant to the fertility suppression and estimate
the population suppressive effects of contraception under various patterns [<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>To deliver an immunocontraceptive vaccine to free-roaming wildlife animals, which are
particularly difficult to access, remote methods for vaccination (vaccine delivery systems)
are necessary [<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Some oral vaccine delivery agents
have been already devised for immunocontraceptive vaccines (e.g., variety of virus vectors,
bacterial ghosts, and liposomes) [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].
Particularly in Japan, the diffusion of recombinant biological vectors into the field is
prohibited legally. Therefore, no proliferative delivery systems such as bacterial ghosts
and liposomes have the potential to be applied to control the mongoose population [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. These
should be selected after investigating further, the compatibility with vaccines and the cost
effectiveness.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Katsushi Nakata and the other staffs of Yambaru
