The embryo is essentially an outside presence in the uterus because only one half of its genetic information is originating from the mother. Why doesn&#x02019;t the mother&#x02019;s system refuse the attachment? One possibility would be a communication between the embryo and the mother before any attachment, convincing the mothers cells that the embryo is not a threat. Using this general theme, we developed a hypothesis that if a communication takes place, it could be in the form of RNA exchange.</p><p id="Par22">We used an artificial trophoblast (outermost later of the embryo) to represent an embryo just about to implant, and endometrial cells (cells lining the inner wall of uterus) as the mothers&#x02019; cells for this experiment. We labelled the RNA in the embryo cells and put embryo and mothers&#x02019; cells together to see if any communication would take place. We were able to capture the labelled RNA inside the mother&#x02019;s cells thus confirming that communication between embryo and the mother occurs and it uses RNA as the medium.</p><p id="Par23">It was also apparent by the way the transport took place, that RNA is being transferred between the cells packaged in extracellular vesicles, the cargo ships of the cell world. We believe that these observations could be a stepping stone in the path of understanding the first communication between a baby and the mother.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background</title><p id="Par24">The development of the mammalian embryo into a fully-fledged organism depends critically on its successful implantation into the uterine wall. However, as a non-self-entity, the embryo must avoid rejection by the mother&#x02019;s immune system, necessitating an intricate set of negotiations before implantation can occur. Thus, the interaction between the fertilised embryo and the maternal tract arguably represents the most important diplomatic process in placental mammals. Despite this, very little is known regarding the language in which these negotiations are carried out.</p><p id="Par25">That the female reproductive tract is able to detect and respond to the presence of gametes and embryos is well established and evident in the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of the oviduct/fallopian tube and endometrial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], suggesting that some form of signal is transmitted by the embryo. While such signals may exist in a variety of forms, several lines of evidence are pointing to the exchange of noncoding RNA (ncRNA) from embryo to mother [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and vice versa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] as a mean of communication leading to alterations of transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles of the maternal tract.</p><p id="Par26">Recent investigations have pointed to the exchange of different forms of ncRNA as a major component of cell-to-cell communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These exchanges seems to be partly mediated through extracellular vesicles (EV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The term EV describes a membrane bound particle with a diameter of 40 to 1000&#x02009;nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Subdivisions of EVs such as exosomes (40 - 100&#x02009;nm) are termed according to their size and biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. EVs carry DNA, RNA and proteins and thus can facilitate cell-to-cell communication via the exchange of these molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Different forms of RNA have been described as cargo of EVs, i.e. mRNA, ncRNA such as microRNA (miRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">MiRNAs are small (&#x0223c;22 nucleotides) non-coding single stranded RNAs which are master post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Over 2000 miRNAs have been discovered in the human genome, which collectively regulate over a third of the genes in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. LncRNA are defined as autonomously transcribed RNA with more than 200 nucleotides. Long intergenic/intervening RNA (lincRNA) are lncRNA which do not overlap protein coding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. There are over 30,000 lncRNAs discovered and annotated, approximately half of which are lincRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. There are over 150 lincRNA with a described putative function. Generally, the function of lincRNA is to modify gene expression by directly affecting nuclear architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Expressions of many lincRNA are known to be altered in several types of cancers including endometrial carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] as well as in polycystic ovary syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. LincRNA LINC473 is reported to be significantly involved in decidualisation by regulating some crucial decidual factors and WNT4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">To best of our knowledge there are currently only two studies that have indicated the uptake of embryonic ncRNA by the endometrial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and vice versa the uptake of the maternal ncRNA by the embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, both of these studies focused on miRNA, and the role of other ncRNAs in maternal-embryo communication has not been addressed. Hence, to fully understand the extent of communication between mother and embryo it is important to investigate the potential of other RNA species exchanged between the embryo and the mother. In the current investigation, we tracked and captured both coding and ncRNA exchanged in cell-cell communication model using a genetic labelling system based on copper (I)-catalysed cycloaddition reaction, also known as bioorthogonal click chemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Bioorthogonal tagging of metabolites (such as nucleic acids, proteins, glycans and lipids) uniquely enables tracking the tagged substance in vivo and in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], while not disrupting other physiological processes. During neurogenesis, for instance, it is possible to visualize bioorthogonally labelled RNA as it spreads over dendron cells using nascent RNA synthesis in presence of 5-ethynyl uridine (EU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Application of a similar EU-RNA labelling system in the present study led to the discovery of transcripts transferred from trophoblast to endometrial cells. Given the well-recognized ethical and technical limitations associated with the study of human embryo-endometrial dialogue in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], we used an established human in vitro implantation model using RL95&#x02013;2, a human epithelial cell line derived from a moderately differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] that exhibits pronounced adhesiveness to trophoblast-derived JAr cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Although JAr and RL 95&#x02013;2 cells are not perfectly similar to the trophoblast and receptive endometrium, there is evidence to infer a significant similarity due to the extensive use of these cell types in embryo adhesion and communication models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We identified specific trophoblast transcripts that were transferred by EVs into endometrial RL95 cells, leading to the down-regulation of the same transcripts in the co-cultured recipient endometrial cells. Furthermore, EVs/nanoparticles captured from conditioned culture media of viable human embryo down-regulated the expression of at least one of the transcripts in the RL95 cells. Interestingly, co-culture of EVs/nanoparticles obtained from the conditioned culture media of degenerating human in vitro fertilization (IVF) embryos did not alter the expression of the particular endogenous transcript in RL95 cells. We suggest that these intriguing findings represent the first steps towards deciphering the &#x02018;spoken language&#x02019; between the embryo and the mother at early stages of conception.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Cell culture and spheroid formation</title><p id="Par29">The human endometrial adenosquamous carcinoma cell line (RL95&#x02013;2) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL-1671, Teddington, UK).

There is evidence of plant cells using ncRNA to communicate within and between the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. These examples are not limited to communication between the members of one species. Inter-species and inter-kingdom communication using ncRNA is also evident. A recent example is the case of miRNAs from the parasitic plant <italic>Cuscuta campestris</italic> targeting host messenger RNAs in the host plants and changing the transcription profile of the host plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Plants use ncRNA to fight fungal infections by inhibiting fungal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In the human context, ncRNA is also likely to play a major role in intercellular communication. A well-known example is the communication and exchange of genetic material involving cancerous cells metastasing to different tissues<sup>39,40</sup>. It seems that cancerous cells are capable of signalling the cells of distant tissues, resulting in the remodelling of those tissues to better support metastatic tumour growth. The signals conveyed by cancerous cells seem to be in the form of ncRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p id="Par72">In nearly all these scenarios, ncRNAs seem to be transferred from one cell to another. Thereafter, the transferred material acts upon gene expression regulation in the recipient cells and changes the transcriptomic profile of them. The consequences of such communication would lead to alterations in the function and physiology of the cells, and ultimately may even result in the occurrence of disease or in the case of reproduction may affect conception and maintenance of the pregnancy. There is evidence of the exchange of miRNA between the pre-implantation embryo and the endometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and vice versa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Exchanged ncRNA could perform a number of functions in the target cells. Considering the lack of immune response towards embryo, which should be identified as &#x0201c;non-self&#x0201d;, from the maternal immune system, one such function could be the modification of maternal immune response. Indeed, there are evidence of maternal immune system treating the embryo as a &#x0201c;temporary self&#x0201d; and assume &#x0201c;immune ignorance&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Initiation and regulation of such unique immune response could be due to epigenetic modification caused by transferred genetic material by the developing embryo.</p><p id="Par73">In the present study we used biorthogonal click chemistry to track trophoblastic RNA and its uptake by endometrial cells. Compared to other enzyme dependent labelling solutions such as 5-bromouridine (BrU), 5-iodouridine (IU), or 5-fluorouridine (FU) which rely on indirect immunofluorescence, EU has a significant advantage to be compatible to be used in Click-chemistry and downstream applications requiring affinity precipitation of labelled RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. However, the efficiency of tagging is around one nucleotide in 35, which is not significantly different from the other labelling methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Another important factor causing approximately 35% non-specifically captured unlabelled RNA in our investigation is the problems associated with RNA Recovery using affinity precipitation protocols.</p><p id="Par74">In the current investigation the origins of three transcripts were identified to be transferred from embryonal to endometrial cells: an intronic-non-coding region and an exonic-coding region, originating from LINC00478, and an exonic-coding region originating from <italic>ZNF81</italic> gene (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2). In the case of transcripts originating from LINC00478, Dfam v2.0 software showed that this transcript matches with <italic>LTR7B</italic> family (ERV1 endogenous retrovirus super family) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Open reading frame prediction demonstrated that 5 kbp upstream of this region might be a considerable potential for endogenous retrovirus protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. The regulatory role of endogenous retroviruses elements in development of human pre-implantation embryo has been strongly emphasized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that <italic>LTR7B</italic> and <italic>LTR7Y</italic> are enriched in the eight-cell/morula and blastocyst stage embryos, respectively. <italic>LTR7</italic> copies can produce specific class of lncRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and in human embryonic stem cells they are involved in the regulatory network of pluripotency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Specific class of ncRNA can also be produced from endogenous retrovirus ERV9, activating the transcription of erythropoiesis genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. These elements can be horizontally transferred via EVs during intercellular communication. For instance, it has been confirmed that the RNA sequence of retrotransposon from human ERVs can be packaged into the EVs and transferred and spread during tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. In addition, the protein products of endogenous retroviral elements (such as envelope glycoprotein syncytin-2) are essential for early embryo and placenta development during implantation and these proteins are transferred by exosomes and are up-taken by endometrial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].</p><p id="Par75">We were not able to precipitate measurable amounts of <italic>ZNF81</italic> transcript from EU labelled spheroid derived EVs due to the low efficiency of EU labelled RNA capture system.

In the case of <italic>ZNF81</italic>, it is believed that this protein has the potential binding site for LINE elements (long interspersed nuclear elements) involved in regulation of many gene expression regulatory networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p><p id="Par76">In all the three identified transferred transcripts, the endogenous expression of the same transcripts in the endometrial cells was significantly down-regulated after JAr cell or JAr cell-derived EVs&#x02019; co-culture (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Down-regulation of gene expression in target cells has been observed in the context of intercellular communication in different cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. RNA-mediated gene expression down-regulation could be achieved using one of the several pathways, such as post-transcriptional gene silencing, co-suppression, quelling, and RNA interference (RNAi) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Recent investigations have postulated that negative feedback mechanisms are utilized by lncRNA to regulate self-expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. LincRNA are capable of increasing or decreasing self-expression or the expressions of specific target genes by interacting with chromatin-modifying complexes to modulate the epigenetic landscape of chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Although the effect of RNA transfer on endogenous RNA down-regulation observed in the current study is likely achieved by the RNA-mediated gene expression regulation, the exact molecular mechanism remains to be discovered by the future studies. However, the possible involvement of RNA-independent mechanism cannot also be entirely excluded due to the heterogeneous nature of EV cargo. To confirm that the EV-transferred transcripts are responsible for the down-regulation of the same endogenous genes, a gene knockout trophoblast model producing EVs without particular transcripts would be essential. Such knock-out trophoblasts will produce EVs without transferred transcript and will allow detailed analysis of counterpart endogenous gene expression and protein function in endometrial cells treated with these modified EVs.</p><p id="Par77">Up to this point, all of the conclusions arrived are based on data gathered using in vitro analogues of trophoblasts. We have used EVs isolated from IVF human embryo conditioned media to confirm that the observed phenomenon is common for both in vitro model and the embryo. One of the main criticisms of assisted reproduction has been its high tendency to cause multiple births. To avoid the issue, single embryo transfer is often practised. Selecting the best embryo for transfer is important in single embryo transfer procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Until very recent past, the selection was done using morphological criteria, such as the number of blastomeres, the absence of multinucleation, early cleavage to the two-cell stage, a low percentage of cell fragments in embryos, the blastocoelic cavity expansion and the cohesiveness and number of the inner cell mass and trophectodermal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Despite of the evolution of the selection criteria for IVF embryos, the rate of live birth remains as low as 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Protein biomarkers from culture media (soluble human leukocyte antigen-G (sHLA-G) and ubiquitin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] and cumulus cell transcriptomic markers (cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR), and pentraxin 3) have been proposed as tools for embryo selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>] without major improvement in the embryo implantation rate.</p><p id="Par78">EVs isolated from conditioned culture media of IVF embryos as early as on day 3 after fertilization have the potential to be used as non-invasive biomarkers for embryo selection. In the current study we provide evidence that EVs/nanoparticles isolated from embryo conditioned culture media can induce a measurable effect on endometrial cells and the effect is only seen when using conditioned media from morphologically good-quality embryos as opposed to degenerating embryos. Although the minimal requirements for EV studies require NTA, Western blot analysis of EV specific proteins and electron microscopy as per International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>], due to the low number of particles isolated from single embryo culture media, Western blot analysis are currently not feasible in this context. However, with the NTA results, it could be argued that these nanoparticles are highly likely to constitute EVs. In the current study endometrial <italic>ZNF81</italic> expression was significantly down-regulated after EV-co-incubation originating from good-prognosis day 3/5 IVF embryos. To the contrary, the EVs from poor prognosis embryos were unable to initiate any changes of endometrial cells. We therefore suggest that with the further development, the EV-based method could be used as a non-invasive tool for selecting high-quality IVF embryos for transfer.</p><p id="Par79">The dose of the EVs received by endometrial cells should also be considered as a limiting factor in the model. Multiple spheroids were used instead of one, which would be more in line with the natural environment of the embryo-maternal interface, because of the very low amount of EVs released from a single spheroid. Analysing such minuscule amounts of RNA is extremely difficult especially considering the low efficiency of labelling observed. It should also be pointed out that in vivo<italic>,</italic> only a few endometrial cells need to be affected by the communications from an embryo, while in the in vitro model, the effect should be seen in thousands of cells to be detected by qPCR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par80">In conclusion, we present the evidence of non-contact transfer of embryonic RNA transcripts to endometrium in an in vitro embryo-maternal cross-talk model. RNA is taken up by the endometrial cells and the expression of endogenous transcripts are altered as a result. The effect can be seen in endometrial cells treated with EVs derived from IVF embryos suggesting that the RNA is transferred through EVs. EVs derived from human IVF embryos also have the potential to change the endometrial transcripts. Interestingly, only good-prognosis embryos induced the observed effect while degenerated embryos failed to initiate any changes. Physiological effects of observed transcript changes are still not fully understood and require follow-up studies.
