Structural variants can initiate tumors, enhance their aggressiveness, and provide unique therapeutic opportunities. Whole-genome sequencing of tumors can allow exhaustive identification of the specific structural variants present in an individual cancer, facilitating both clinical diagnostics and the discovery of novel mutagenic mechanisms. A plethora of somatic structural variant detection algorithms have been created to enable these discoveries; however, there are no systematic benchmarks of them. Rigorous performance evaluation of somatic structural variant detection methods has been challenged by the lack of gold standards, extensive resource requirements, and difficulties arising from the need to share personal genomic information.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">To facilitate structural variant detection algorithm evaluations, we create a robust simulation framework for somatic structural variants by extending the BAMSurgeon algorithm. We then organize and enable a crowdsourced benchmarking within the ICGC-TCGA DREAM Somatic Mutation Calling Challenge (SMC-DNA). We report here the results of structural variant benchmarking on three different tumors, comprising 204 submissions from 15 teams. In addition to ranking methods, we identify characteristic error profiles of individual algorithms and general trends across them. Surprisingly, we find that ensembles of analysis pipelines do not always outperform the best individual method, indicating a need for new ways to aggregate somatic structural variant detection approaches.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">The synthetic tumors and somatic structural variant detection leaderboards remain available as a community benchmarking resource, and BAMSurgeon is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/adamewing/bamsurgeon">https://github.com/adamewing/bamsurgeon</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s13059-018-1539-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Somatic mutations</kwd><kwd>Simulation</kwd><kwd>Structural variants</kwd><kwd>Benchmarking</kwd><kwd>Cancer genomics</kwd><kwd>Whole-genome sequencing</kwd><kwd>Crowdsourcing</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012118</institution-id><institution>Ontario Institute for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000109</institution-id><institution>Prostate Cancer Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008719</institution-id><institution>Movember Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RS2014-01</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Genome Canada</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (CA)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000196</institution-id><institution>Canada Foundation for Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004376</institution-id><institution>Terry Fox Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE150101117</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Mater Foundation</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-CA180778, U24-CA143858</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par4">Somatic structural variants (SVs) are mutations that arise in tumors involving rearrangements, duplications, or deletions of large segments of DNA. SVs are often defined to be events larger than 100&#x000a0;bp in size, although with significant variability in this definition. Somatic SVs are critical in driving and regulating tumor biology. They can initiate tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and, because they are unique to the cancer, can serve as highly selective avenues for therapeutic intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The overall mutation load of somatic SVs serves as a proxy for genomic instability and can robustly predict tumor aggressiveness in multiple tumor types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">While somatic SVs that alter copy number can be detected using microarray assays, the resolution of such studies is limited, and many other important types of SVs cannot be detected. As a result, high-throughput DNA sequencing is now a standard approach for detecting SVs in cancer genomes. Although RNA-based assays are useful for detecting SVs that alter protein structure, DNA-based assays are required for most others. As a result, a broad range of algorithms has been developed to detect SVs from short-read sequencing data using read depth analysis, split read (i.e., a read that maps to multiple different parts of the reference sequence) alignment, paired-end mapping, and de novo assembly techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, the accuracy of existing methods is poorly described. There are no comprehensive benchmarks of somatic SV detection approaches. Most comparison results are reported by the developers of newly published methods. These developer-run benchmarks are potentially subject to several types of selection biases. For example, the developers of one tool may be experts in parameterizing and tuning it, but may lack the same skill in tuning methods developed by others. Further, evaluating the accuracy of somatic SV detection is more challenging than evaluating the accuracy of somatic single nucleotide variant (SNV) detection as validation data is more difficult to generate for SVs. Even the metrics of measuring accuracy are not agreed upon, with no community-accepted standards on how SV prediction accuracy should be assessed, especially when predictions are close to, but not exactly at, the actual sequence breakpoints. As a result, there are no robust estimates of the false positive and false negative rates of somatic SV prediction tools on tumors of different characteristics.</p><p id="Par6">To fill this gap, we created an open challenge-based assessment of somatic SV prediction tools as part of the ICGC-TCGA DREAM Somatic Mutation Calling Challenge (the Challenge). The lack of fully characterized tumor genomes for building gold standard sets of SVs motivated our simulation approach. Specifically, we first extended BAMSurgeon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], a tool for adding simulated mutations to existing reads, to generate somatic SVs. This approach is advantageous because it permits flexibility with the added mutations while also capturing sequencing technology biases through the use of existing reads. We created and distributed in silico tumors (IS1-IS3), on which 204 submissions were made by 15 teams.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Simulation of SVs with BAMSurgeon</title><p id="Par7">In addition to point mutations [SNVs and short insertions or deletions (INDELs)], BAMSurgeon is capable of creating simple SVs through read selection, local sequence assembly, manipulation of assembled contigs, and simulation of sequence coverage over the altered contigs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). This, combined with careful tracking of read depth, yields approximations of SVs including insertions, deletions, duplication, and inversions into pre-existing backgrounds of real sequence data. Here, we present results based on simulations of those SV types. Subsequent to the Challenge, BAMSurgeon was extended to support translocations and more complex rearrangements. The BAMSurgeon manual, available online, contains a full description of input formatting and available parameters. The input regions define where local assembly will be attempted via Velvet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For each region, the largest assembled contig is selected and re-aligned to the reference genome using Exonerate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The contig is then trimmed to the length of its longest contiguous alignment, and the alignment is used to accurately track breakpoint locations within the contig in terms of reference coordinate space. The location and identity of reads from the original BAM file in the assembled contig are tracked via parsing of the AMOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] file output by Velvet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], which also enables tracking of reads included or excluded after contig trimming. If a suitable contig (i.e., sufficiently long, with a sufficiently low number of discordant read pairs) is not available for a given input region, no mutation is made for that region. For each segment where contig assembly succeeds, the contig is rearranged according to the user specification (e.g., insertion, deletion, duplication, or inversion of sequence). Then, paired reads are simulated from the rearranged contig using wgsim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], with specific parameters controllable by the user. Because reads are simulated using the rearranged contig, breakpoint-spanning reads and reads that will be discordant versus the reference genome assembly will be created. The number of reads simulated (final coverage, <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub>) depends on the original coverage <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub>, the difference in length between the original contig <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub> and the rearranged contig <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub><italic>,</italic> and a user-specified parameter controlling variant allele fraction (VAF). Thus, <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;VAF*<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub>*(<italic>L</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub>/<italic>L</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub>). Duplications and insertions result in larger contigs and require new reads to be added to the final BAM, and deletions yielding a smaller contig require reads to be removed from the final BAM. In the latter case, a list of reads to be deleted is maintained, which correspond to reads covering the deleted region in the original BAM. BAMSurgeon requires approximately 4&#x000a0;GB of memory per thread if using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA). Its runtime varies depending on the number, variety, and locations of the mutations, as well as the depth of the original BAM. On average, runtime is about 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;min per SV per thread followed by several hours to integrate all mutations into the output BAM, for a deeply sequenced (e.g., 60&#x000d7;) genome. These are wallclock times, with the majority being spent in writing reads into the BAM file.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>BAMSurgeon simulates SVs in genome sequences. Method for adding SVs to existing BAM alignments. <bold>a</bold> Overview of SV (e.g., deletion) spike-in: Starting with an original BAM (i), a region (ii) is selected where a deletion is desired. (iii) Contigs are assembled from reads in the selected region, and the contig is rearranged by deleting the middle. The amount of contig deleted is a user-definable parameter. Read coverage is generated over the contig using wgsim to match the number of reads per base in the original BAM. Since the deletion contig is shorter than the original, fewer reads will be required to achieve the equivalent coverage. (iv) Generated read pairs include discordant pairs (i.e., paired reads that do not align to the reference genome with the expected relative orientation and inner distance) spanning the deletion and clipped reads (i.e., reads that are only partially aligned to the reference).

Briefly, we used BAMSurgeon to generate synthetic tumor-normal pairs, with the same set of target mutations, that differ by the division of reads into tumor and normal sequence sets, aligner, or cell line. The target mutation set was designed to generate a synthetic tumor with a baseline level of complexity and thus did not include insertions. We ran four SV callers using default parameters on each pair: two widely used callers, CREST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and Delly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and two callers developed over the course of the Challenge, Manta, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and novoBreak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We did not optimize parameters for the callers since the goal of this validation was not to identify the best caller, but instead to verify that the caller ranking is maintained across analogous datasets.</p><p id="Par9">The definition of a SV suggests different scoring schemes for measuring the performance of a caller. All SVs can be defined by at least one breakpoint; deletions, duplications, and inversions are SVs defined by a pair of breakpoints that in turn defines a genomic region. Thus, we compared called SVs to gold-standard SVs based on (i) region overlap or (ii) breakpoint closeness (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2).

Here, we focus on the breakpoint closeness scheme since it is well suited for all types of SVs. A called SV that is sufficiently similar to a known SV based on such criteria was considered a true positive; otherwise, a false positive. We used such annotations to assess the performance of a caller in terms of precision (fraction of calls that are true), recall (fraction of known SVs called), and <italic>F</italic>-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Caller scoring schemes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Basis of comparison</th><th>Region overlap<break/>(Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2a)</th><th>Breakpoint closeness<break/>(Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2b)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Description</td><td>SVs match if there is sufficient overlap, determined with a Jaccard threshold parameter, between the genomic region associated with the called SV and that of the known SV</td><td>SVs match if the breakpoints of the called SV are sufficiently close to the those of the known SV, i.e. breakpoints are within <italic>f</italic> bp of one another where <italic>f</italic> is a flank parameter</td></tr><tr><td>Strengths</td><td>&#x025cf; Identifies genomic regions affected by the known SVs</td><td>&#x025cf; Suited to all types of SVs<break/>&#x025cf; Evaluates precision of breakpoint predictions, facilitating subsequent breakpoint validation</td></tr><tr><td>Weaknesses</td><td>&#x025cf; Some SVs are not accurately defined by genomic regions, e.g., an insertion may be characterized by a single breakpoint<break/>&#x025cf; Need criteria to define sufficient overlap</td><td>&#x025cf; Need criteria to define sufficient closeness</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par10">We performed several quality-control experiments.

Second, the same ranking was observed when alignments were generated either using the BWA or NovoAlign with and without INDEL realignment (i.e., local realignment to minimize mismatches across reads due to INDELs relative to the reference genome), indicating that the ranking was independent of the aligner used (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3c). Lastly, when the genomic background was varied by using HCC1143 BL or HCC1954 BL sequence data, the caller ranking was largely independent of the cell line: Manta and novoBreak retained first and second place, respectively, while CREST and Delly swapped places, although their <italic>F</italic>-scores were very similar to each other when HCC1954 BL was used (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3d).

Briefly, the datasets were derived from existing cell line sequence data (thus minimizing data access restrictions) and in silico tumors 1&#x02013;3 (IS1-IS3) were generated with increasing complexity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). In terms of SVs, breakpoint locations were randomly selected and the tumors had increasing mutation rates (371 vs. 2886 somatic SVs in IS1 and IS3, respectively). Moreover, IS1 contained deletions, duplications, and inversions while IS2 and IS3 additionally contained insertions. Like the SNV component, the SV component of the Challenge was implemented using the Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) framework. Briefly, information about the Challenge was shared on its website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; participants registered online, downloaded a dataset, applied their SV calling pipelines to the dataset, and submitted the results in Variant Call Format (VCF) v4.1. IS1-IS3 were released sequentially; each dataset had its own competition phase; and participants could make multiple submissions for each dataset. Each tumor genome was divided into a training set and a testing set by holding out a portion of the genome. During the competition phase, leaderboards showed performance measures on the training set. After the competition closed, leaderboards also showed performance measures on the whole genome (training + testing sets).</p><p id="Par12">The Challenge administration team prepopulated the leaderboards with two submissions, and the community provided 204 submissions from 15 teams (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). A list of all submissions, and descriptions of pipelines used to generate them, can be found in Additional&#x000a0;files&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>, respectively. The submissions were surprisingly discordant in format. For example, between 5.5% and 11% of all submissions specified SV types that are not in the VCF controlled vocabulary for types (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). For this reason and the ambiguity of specifying SV types (i.e., the same SV can be specified with a specific type, or by specifying the breakpoints and break-end adjacencies), type specifications were ignored when scoring submissions. Team ranking varied with the stringency of the scoring (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2d-i). For simplicity, we focused on scoring with <italic>f</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;100&#x000a0;bp due to the balance between the median and variance of the resulting <italic>F</italic>-scores (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4). While the top-performing teams achieved near maximal precision on the simplest tumor, IS1, their recall remained less than 0.9 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) and decreased further on the other tumors (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5a,b). On all three tumors, <italic>F-</italic>scores on the training and testing sets were highly correlated [Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation coefficient (<italic>&#x003c1;</italic>) &#x02265;&#x02009;0.98; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;1: Figure S5c,d]. However, the slightly elevated <italic>F-</italic>scores in the training sets observed for IS1 and IS2 may reflect minor overfitting; overfitting occurs when a statistical model is tuned to the training set, limiting generalizability. Notably, the total number of somatic SV mutations in IS3 is &#x0003e;&#x02009;4&#x000d7; that for IS1 and IS2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Conversely, the percentage of mutations used for training is greater for IS1 (93%) and IS2 (92%) vs. IS3 (89%). Sampling from the IS3 mutations, we simulated training and testing sets of different sizes and computed the differences between the <italic>F-</italic>scores on the training sets and the <italic>F</italic>-scores on the testing sets. We found that that the differences tend to be greater when the percentage of mutations used for training is greater (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5e). This suggests that the <italic>F-</italic>score differences observed for IS1 and IS2 are at least in part an artifact of training set size.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Teams</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Team ID</th><th>Method name</th><th>Institute</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Standard</td><td>BreakDancer</td><td>Challenge Administrators</td></tr><tr><td>Team 1</td><td>Delly<sup>1</sup></td><td>European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)</td></tr><tr><td>Team 2</td><td>Manta</td><td>Illumina, Inc.</td></tr><tr><td>Team 3</td><td>Meerkat</td><td>Harvard Medical School</td></tr><tr><td>Team 4</td><td>novoBreak</td><td>MD Anderson Cancer Center</td></tr><tr><td>Team 5</td><td>deStruct<sup>2</sup></td><td>BC Cancer Agency Research Centre</td></tr><tr><td>Team 6</td><td>SWAN</td><td>Wharton School</td></tr><tr><td>Team 7</td><td>SmuFin</td><td>Barcelona Supercomputing Center</td></tr><tr><td>Team 8</td><td>not available</td><td>Peking University</td></tr><tr><td>Team 9</td><td>deStruct<sup>2</sup></td><td>Simon Fraser University</td></tr><tr><td>Team 10</td><td>GROM</td><td>Rutgers University</td></tr><tr><td>Team 11</td><td>Pindel</td><td>McDonnell Genome Institute</td></tr><tr><td>Team 12</td><td>PAVFinder</td><td>Canada&#x02019;s Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre</td></tr><tr><td>Team 13</td><td>Delly<sup>1</sup></td><td>Georgetown University Medical Center,<break/>National Cancer Institute</td></tr><tr><td>Team 14</td><td>Subread</td><td>Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research</td></tr><tr><td>Team 15</td><td>CX</td><td>Wharton School</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Teams that made submissions for IS1, IS2, and/or IS3, the names of the SV detection methods they used, and the institutes to which they belong</p><p><sup>1</sup>Delly was developed by Team 1 and also used by Team 13</p><p><sup>2</sup>deStruct was developed by Team 9 and also used by Team 5</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Overview of the SV Calling Challenge submissions. <bold>a</bold> Precision-recall plot of IS1 submissions.

Specifically, we aggregated SV calls into an ensemble by first identifying sufficiently similar calls in the majority of the top <italic>k</italic> submissions.

We considered two variations of this approach: (i) a baseline approach with ensembles of the best submission from each team and (ii) a conservative approach with ensembles of all submissions (where the top <italic>k</italic> may include multiple submissions from the same team) and more stringent aggregation of called SVs (see the &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d; section).

While some SV types may be well-characterized by overlap-based scoring methods, others benefit more from breakpoint-based scoring, and the choice of scoring metric and stringency parameters must be tuned to specific biological questions of interest. For example, breakpoint identification is critical when considering translocations&#x02014;especially those generating candidate fusion proteins&#x02014;while overlap of the called and known regions is much more important for copy-number analyses. Moreover, it may be useful to adapt scoring (e.g., by using a range of stringency parameter values) to identify SVs in certain contexts (e.g., with breakpoints in repetitive regions) that are still detectable by given tools, but with less precision. Taken together, SV diversity is an important consideration for the development of standards for scoring SV detection.</p><p id="Par20">The &#x0201c;wisdom of the crowds&#x0201d; is the idea that an ensemble of multiple algorithms can significantly outperform any individual method. Several crowdsourced benchmarking competitions from diverse fields have shown great success in combining submissions from contestants to achieve a high-performing meta-predictor including challenges for somatic SNV detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], gene regulatory network inference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and mRNA-based prognostic signatures for breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. By contrast, in somatic SV detection, we do not have clear evidence that an ensemble improves on the best individual method consistently across different tumors. Specifically, the majority vote approach works very well for somatic SNV detection, yet it appears to fail for somatic SV detection. This may reflect the large diversity in the biases of each individual algorithm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Rather than focus on commonalities through a majority vote, it may be more beneficial to leverage the strengths of individual algorithms. This might be achieved by using machine learning to optimize the weighting of the algorithms for specific input patterns. For example, an aggregating classifier could learn, if there is a sizable difference in coverage in the tumor versus normal samples near given candidate breakpoints, the calling algorithms that use read depth analysis should have more weight. The overall approach could involve the following general steps: (1) apply all algorithms of interest to a given tumor-normal dataset and take the union of all resulting call sets to define a list of candidate SVs; then for each candidate, (2) compute sequence features (e.g., coverage) around the candidate breakpoints, and (3) provide computed features and confidence scores from individual algorithms as input to an aggregating classifier that will indicate whether or not the candidate is likely to be a true SV. In fact, a similar approach is behind the SMC-DNA Meta-pipeline Challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] for benchmarking pipelines that aggregate calls from different SNV detection algorithms. In practice, analogous efforts for SV detection would require additional considerations such as the identification of (i) an optimal method for merging similar yet different calls (due to imprecise breakpoint calling) when compiling the list of candidate SVs, (ii) the most informative sequence features for guiding the relative weighting of individual algorithms (e.g., variables in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), and (iii) an optimal scoring method (as mentioned above). Thus, there is a need for continued development of new, more complex ways to integrate multiple somatic SV detection methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Given the paucity of gold-standard benchmarking data for somatic SVs, the creation of the simulated datasets and the associated leaderboards constitutes a major contribution of this Challenge. Ideally, a simulated dataset depicts realistic mutations through realistic sequence reads. The synthetic tumors generated for the Challenge only represent straightforward SV types (duplication, deletion, insertion, inversion) and cover relatively small regions. Subsequent enhancements to BAMSurgeon have added support for additional SV types including translocations and complex SV combinations, enabling simulations to more completely capture the complexity of tumor genomes and, by extension, challenge SV callers in different ways. For each SV, simulated reads are generated (via wgsim) from a re-arranged contig, where the original contig is constructed from real reads. Despite the basis on real reads, the simulated reads do not necessarily reflect the non-uniform coverage that may arise during preparation of real samples, for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. There are other read simulators that learn biased-coverage trends from real data and use them to generate reads (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]) that could be used by BAMSurgeon; however, it is an on-going challenge to simulate biases of real sequencing data as sample preparation methods and sequencing technologies vary and/or advance. In fact, one could sequence the same &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; sample twice to capture inter-sample variability, with one replicate converted into a synthetic tumor sample using BAMSurgeon. Nevertheless, there are distinct advantages to benchmarking on simulated datasets. It is dramatically easier to simulate large numbers of tumors, or to create tumors with highly divergent mutational properties, leading to well-supported estimates of per-tumor caller accuracy. This enables our strategy of generating synthetic tumors of increasing complexity (e.g., with other SV types and/or haplotype structure by using phased sequence data) whereby the impact of the complexity introduced at each step can be assessed. With the three synthetic tumors described here, we observed that caller ranking varied across tumors and we expect it to vary with a broad range of tumor characteristics including coverage, normal contamination, complexity of the SVs, the number of mutations adjacent to breakpoints, and others, as they each present different challenges. It is possible to identify strengths and weaknesses of an individual caller by comparing its tumor-specific error profiles. Moreover, synthetic tumors can be designed to test the limits of callers. These advantages highlight the usefulness of synthetic datasets for benchmarking callers, and until synthetic datasets are completely realistic, they will serve as important complements to real datasets.</p><p id="Par22">While 15 teams participated in the actual competitive phase of the Challenge, 8 teams have exploited the IS1-3 benchmarking resources since the competition, making 73 submissions to benchmark their methods for pipeline evaluation and development. Evaluations based on the first synthetic tumors, the simplest by design, provide lower bounds on the error rates. As subsequent updates to BAMSurgeon enable the generation of more complex and realistic tumors, the corresponding error rates using these simulations will approach their upper bounds. We hope that journals and developers will begin to plan for benchmarking on these standard datasets, including simulated ones, as a standard part of manuscripts reporting new somatic SV detection algorithms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par23">Analysis of the error profiles of the Challenge submissions showed that somatic SV calling is a distinctly harder problem than somatic SNV calling even given a relatively simple set of SVs, with individual pipelines having complex and unique error profiles.

Our descriptions of BAMSurgeon&#x02019;s method for simulating SVs are current as of commit (i.e., version) b851573474 of the code available at [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">As input, BAMSurgeon (addsv.py) requires an indexed reference genome, a pre-existing BAM file (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1a), and a list of intervals (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1b) along with the SV type and parameters (see manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]). The intervals should be wide enough that local sequence assembly is successful in generating a contig that spans at least two times the expected library size in the input BAM file. Intervals for which a sufficiently long contig cannot be generated are rejected, where the exact definition of &#x0201c;sufficiently long&#x0201d; is an optional parameter. Note that it may be less likely to obtain long contigs from genomic regions that are more difficult to sequence and, by extension, less likely to simulate SVs in such regions. Intervals which contain too many discordant read pairs (again, potentially indicating regions that are difficult to sequence) are also rejected, subject to a parameter. Following local assembly, the contig is re-arranged: the specific rearrangements for each supported SV type are illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> (step iii) and Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1c,e,g. The assembled contig is then re-aligned to the target interval in the reference genome (exonerate --bestn 1 -m ungapped) and is trimmed based on the start and end coordinates of this alignment. Read pairs corresponding to trimmed contig sequence are removed from further consideration.</p><p id="Par26">Read coverage is generated over the rearranged contig using a read simulator (wgsim -e 0 -R 0 -r 0), to achieve the same average depth as the input BAM file, which has the effect of creating split reads relative to the reference genome supporting SV detection. For a deletion, the number of reads required to achieve, for example, 30&#x000d7; coverage is fewer than the number of reads required to reach 30&#x000d7; coverage prior to the deletion, so reads must be removed from the original BAM (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, step iv). Inversely, for duplications and insertions, additional reads need to be added to the original BAM (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1d,h). Inversions generally do not affect coverage (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1f). To ensure any reads removed actually correspond to the deleted region of the contig, the locations of reads in the assembled contig are tracked. The number of reads to be replaced, added, or deleted is scaled with the desired allele fraction. Finally, any read pairs in the original BAM corresponding to reads altered in the simulated SV are replaced, any read pairs marked for deletion are removed from the original BAM, and any additional read pairs generated are added. It is recommended that the resulting altered BAM be post-processed (with postprocess.py) to ensure compliance with the SAM format specification (see manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Synthetic tumor generation</title><p id="Par27">Synthetic tumors were prepared by partitioning high-coverage BAMs from &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; cell lines into two groups of reads, picking read pairs at random as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Alternatively, one could sequence the same &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; sample twice to capture inter-sample variability, with one replicate converted into a synthetic tumor sample using BAMSurgeon. For the three in silico challenges, non-overlapping regions were selected at random for SV addition, resulting in 371 variants added for IS1, 655 for IS2, and 2886 for IS3 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Variant input files are available in Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>. SVs were added using addsv.py with assembly GRCh37/hg19 as the reference genome and default parameters except where noted. For IS3, to simulate subclones, a file specifying CNV fractions over SV regions was input via option -c to specify the variant allele frequency (VAF) of the spiked-in variants at either 0.5, 0.33, or 0.2 (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). The output BAMs were post-processed to account for any inconsistencies introduced due to remapping and merging of reads supporting SVs using the script postprocess.py included with BAMSurgeon. The BAMs were further adjusted with RealignerTargetCreator and IndelRealigner from the Genome Analysis Toolkit (v.2.4.9). All tumor-normal pairs generated via BAMSurgeon are verified for adherence to the SAM/BAM format specification using the ValidateSamFile tool included in the Picard tool set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Truth VCF files, i.e., files specifying simulated mutations, for SVs were generated using the script etc/makevcf_sv.py and merged with truth files for SNP and INDEL locations, where applicable. SAMtools was used throughout to split, merge, sort, and index BAMs, and also index FASTA files.

To remove ambiguity, we choose a single annotation for each breakpoint by prioritizing as follows: TP &#x0003e; FN &#x0003e; FP. This prioritization favors good performance (i.e., TP has highest priority) and then recall (i.e., FN &#x0003e; FP) since it appears to be a greater challenge than precision for SV calling (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5a,b). TN breakpoints should be unambiguous due to the way in which they were sampled (see above).</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Genomic variables</title><p id="Par60">For each breakpoint position, we computed 16 genomic factors, 12 of which were previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The additional genomic variables were computed as follows:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>A.</label><p id="Par61">Bridging reads count: We used samtools v0.1.19 to identify reads in the tumor BAM mapped to a genomic region containing the window defined by the breakpoint position &#x000b1;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;bp.

Reference and alternative allele counts, base quality, tumor, and normal coverages, bridging reads counts and distances to the germline SNP and INDEL, were logged (base 10) prior to computing correlations (zeros were replaced with &#x02212;&#x02009;1 instead of logged). For the categorical variables, trinucleotide, and genomic location, the <italic>P</italic> value measured the significance of the variable in a fitted binomial model predicting the FN/FP rate at a breakpoint. A binomial model was fitted because it is a relatively simple model (and thus less prone to overfitting) to test the relationship between a categorical variable and a proportion variable (i.e., an error rate).</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Multivariate analysis</title><p id="Par66">Random forests were generated as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] with a few alterations. Here, a total of 16 genomic variables (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) were used to build: (i) a classifier to distinguish FN and TP breakpoints and (ii) a classifier to distinguish FP and TN breakpoints. A FP classifier was not generated for Team 7 with respect to IS1 since the team produced only one FP, and thus, there was insufficient data to generate an accurate model. Conversely, a FP classifier was not generated for Team 14 with respect to IS2 since the team produced a very large number of FPs (17,806) that caused a failure to converge. Computation of the directional effect of variables was also as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par67">Non-parametric tests (i.e., Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests) were used throughout to avoid assumptions about the distributions of the tested populations; all tested populations had <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;7. The BEDTools suite (v2.18.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]) was used with the bedR R package (v0.5.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]) throughout. Plots were generated with the BPG (v5.3.9), lattice (v0.20-33), and latticeExtra (v0.6-26) R packages, and R (v3.2.1) was used throughout.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec26"><p>
