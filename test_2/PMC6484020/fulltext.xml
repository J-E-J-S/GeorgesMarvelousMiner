LOF mutations have proven recalcitrant to pharmacologic intervention, presenting a challenge for the development of targeted therapeutics. Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which contains core subunits (EZH2, EED, and SUZ12), regulates gene activity by trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27. The dysregulation of PRC2 catalytic activity by mutations has been implicated in cancer and other diseases. Among the mutations that cause PRC2 malfunction, an I363M LOF mutation of EED has been identified in myeloid disorders, where it prevents allosteric activation of EZH2 catalysis. We describe structure-based design and computational simulations of ligands created to ameliorate this LOF. Notably, these compounds selectively stimulate the catalytic activity of PRC2-EED-I363M over wildtype-PRC2. Overall, this work demonstrates the feasibility of developing targeted therapeutics for PRC2-EED-I363M that act as allosteric agonists, potentially correcting this LOF mutant phenotype.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Computational chemistry</kwd><kwd>Myelodysplastic syndrome</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004093</institution-id><institution>Kwanjeong Educational Foundation (KEF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13AmB65D</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Suh</surname><given-names>Junghyun L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Health &#x00026;amp; Human Services | NIH | National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM100919</award-id><award-id>R01GM100919</award-id><award-id>R01GM100919</award-id><award-id>R01GM100919</award-id><award-id>R01GM100919</award-id><award-id>R01GM100919</award-id><award-id>R01GM100919</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Suh</surname><given-names>Junghyun L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Barnash</surname><given-names>Kimberly D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Abramyan</surname><given-names>Tigran M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Fengling</given-names></name><name><surname>Engelberg</surname><given-names>Isabelle A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kireev</surname><given-names>Dmitri B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Frye</surname><given-names>Stephen V.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Health &#x00026;amp; Human Services | NIH | National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R61DA047023</award-id><award-id>R61DA047023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Fengling</given-names></name><name><surname>Engelberg</surname><given-names>Isabelle A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100009744</institution-id><institution>UNC | UNC-Chapel Hill | Eshelman Institute for Innovation, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC Eshelman Institute for Innovation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RX0351210</award-id><award-id>RX03712105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frye</surname><given-names>Stephen V.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The discovery of small molecules capable of targeting mutated and overexpressed proteins that act as drivers of disease ushered in the modern era of oncology drug discovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, many disease-causing mutations are difficult to target directly because they result from loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the proteins in which they occur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. LOF mutant proteins are often misfolded, destabilized, and otherwise not biochemically active, making them more difficult to &#x02018;rescue&#x02019; therapeutically compared to inhibiting an intact, but over-active protein (the targets of the vast majority of drugs). While approaches relying on protein replacement and gene therapy can correct some of these deficits, they suffer from high-costs, require parenteral routes of administration, and are difficult to apply in less developed locations. Therefore, discovery of small molecule pharmacologic methods to correct for LOF mutations is critical to expanding the applicability of genetically targeted approaches in the treatment of human disease.</p><p id="Par3">The 400 or so proteins involved in chromatin structure and epigenetic gene regulation are frequently subject to mutations associated with developmental disorders and cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Changes in chromatin structure serve to regulate the genome by controlling access to the underlying DNA. The deposition, recognition, and removal of post-translational modifications (PTM) on histones is one mechanism by which chromatin structure can be regulated, and the dysregulation of these PTMs has been implicated in tumorigenesis and various diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Polycomb group (PcG) complexes, PRC1 and PRC2, are critical regulators of transcriptional repression <italic>via</italic> their ability to modify chromatin structure at target genes.

PRC2 is composed of three essential subunits including EZH1/2, EED, SUZ12, while a fourth subunit, RbAp46/48, is thought to be necessary for full methyltransferase activity. Importantly, the catalytic SET domain of EZH1/2 is known to adopt an inactive conformation and association with EED and SUZ12 is required for activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. EED is a methyl-lysine (Kme) reader protein of the WD40 family. Through the binding of its aromatic cage to H3K27me3, the catalytic product of PRC2, as well as JARID2, a PRC2 accessory protein methylated at lysine 116 (K116me3), EED functionally stimulates PRC2 activity. Recent structural studies revealed that the ability of EED to allosterically activate EZH2 depends on its binding to these methylated substrates, which serves to stabilize the active conformation of EZH2. Specifically, the stimulation-responsive motif (SRM) helix of EZH2 exhibits a disorder-to-order conformational transition upon binding of EED to a methylated peptide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Several mutations of PRC2 subunits have been reported which disrupt normal PRC2 function, resulting in diseases such as lymphoma, prostate cancer, and Weaver syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations within the catalytic SET domain of EZH2 have been implicated in several types of lymphoma. These mutations increase the trimethylase activity of the enzyme thereby increasing the levels of trimethyl lysine 27 (H3K27me3) in cells and aberrantly repressing gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. A number of small-molecule inhibitors targeting either the catalytic SET domain of EZH2 or the EED-methyl-lysine interface have been developed to antagonize this upregulated PRC2 activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Among them, A-395 and EED226 are recently reported PRC2 allosteric antagonists that bind to the H3K27me3 binding site on the beta-propeller WD40 domain of EED by remodeling the EED binding pocket, preventing stabilization of the SRM helix and subsequent PRC2 catalytic activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In common with other small molecule targeted therapeutics, these agents all serve to decrease the activity of a GOF mutation.</p><p id="Par6">Mutations also occur outside the PRC2 catalytic domain: EED-I363M, which is a LOF mutation, has been identified in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and related diseases. This mutation leads to increased susceptibility to myeloid cancers by impairing EED binding to H3K27me3, thereby abrogating allosteric activation of PRC2 catalytic activity and suppressing propagation of H3K27me3 repressive histone marks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. I363 is located adjacent to the EED methyl-lysine binding pocket, yet a detailed mechanistic understanding of how EED-I363M prevents H3K27me3 binding remains elusive. Furthermore, EED-I363M is expressed at similar levels to that of wildtype EED and is incorporated into PRC2 in cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, making it a potential target for a mutant-selective agonist that could re-activate the EED-I363M mutant PRC2 enzyme. Consequently, we sought to pursue the development of ligands that bind EED-I363M, allosterically induce the active conformation of EZH2, and activate PRC2 catalysis in a similar fashion to the cognate ligand with wildtype PRC2, thereby correcting this LOF mutation and restoring normal levels of H3K27 methylation.</p><p id="Par7">Historically, the ability to pharmacologically reverse the functional consequences of disease-causing, LOF mutations has been a challenge. In this study, we combined structure-based design and computational simulations to create mutant-selective allosteric agonists of PRC2-EED-I363M. Using previously reported WT-EED allosteric antagonists as a template, we were able to rationally modify these inhibitors to create mutant-selective activators, which were characterized in a PRC2 catalytic activity assay. Computational simulations further revealed the structural details of ligand binding and a rationale for their mechanism of action. Finally, we anticipate that these proof-of-concept tool compounds will inspire the development of more drug-like EED-I363M activators in an effort to restore PRC2 function in disease relevant settings, such as MDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design and synthesis of peptidomimetic allosteric activators</title><p id="Par8">Recent structural and molecular studies have provided critical insight into the mechanism by which PRC2 activity is regulated by EED binding to JARID2 K116me3 (or H3K27me3) (PDB ID: 5HYN) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In brief, methylated JARID2 binds EED and is then sandwiched between EED and EZH2 stabilizing EZH2&#x02019;s SRM helix (residues 143&#x02013;153) adjacent to the catalytic SET domain. The SRM helix then binds to the i-SET domain, decreasing its occupancy of the substrate-binding channel, thus maintaining EZH2 in its catalytically active conformation. Based on this mechanism, we aimed to design a synthetic activator that would both bind the Kme reader pocket of EED-I363M and retain the ability of JARID2 to stabilize the SRM helix of EZH2.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Structure and dynamics of PRC2 activation.

Importantly, these peptidomimetic inhibitors adopt a binding mode that is analogous to the endogenous EED ligands making them well-suited starting points for the discovery of PRC2 activators.

Our MD simulations indicate that the main interactions between JARID2 and EZH2 include salt bridges between R115 of JARID2 and D140 and, to a lesser extent, D136 of EZH2 as determined by calculating the average minimum residue-residue distances (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SI</xref> Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2A,B</xref>). These interactions were persistent in WT PRC2-EED and appeared to be the major factor in stabilizing the SRM helix. Both interactions were less frequent in mutant PRC2 containing EED-I363M, eventually leading to the SRM helix unfolding (<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SI</xref> Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2C,D</xref>).

Encouragingly, compared to methylated JARID2, these compounds not only selectively activated PRC2-EED-I363M and showed minimal effects on the activity of PRC2-WT, but also activated the mutant complex at a lower concentration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SI</xref> Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>).

In contrast, <bold>5</bold> in which the N-terminal proline of <bold>2</bold> is acetylated more closely resembles a weak inhibitor of PRC2-WT activity than an activator. Together, these results demonstrate that the simple introduction of a charged residue N-terminal to Kme3 in UNC4859 has the capability to convert UNC4859 from a PRC2 inhibitor to a mutant selective PRC2 activator; however, this modification alone is not sufficient for activation. Additionally, it seems likely that the basicity and/or charge of the proline amine contributes to the activation potential of these ligands, as acetylation at this position limits activation, potentially through reduced interactions with Y308 and C324 in EED.</p><p id="Par13">Unlike the UNC4859 derivatives, the UNC5114 analogs were unable to activate PRC2-EED-I363M and inhibited PRC2-WT catalytic activity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SI</xref> Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). The octahydroindole ring in these compounds is quite constrained and the amine installed on this capping group is perhaps not well positioned to interact favorably with D136 and/or D140 on the EZH2 loop. Interestingly, as the length of the side chain becomes longer, the compounds show better inhibition of PRC2-WT. We speculated that an acidic patch formed by D362 on the surface of EED opposite to the aromatic cage forms a salt bridge with the positively charged lysine side-chain mimetics. This interaction appears to be more stable with the longer linker, which could be the reason why compound <bold>3</bold> showed the highest inhibition of PRC2-WT among these three compounds. We elaborate on this hypothesis further in the simulation section of this manuscript.</p><p id="Par14">We next determined EC<sub>50</sub> values for the three UNC4859-derivatives compounds (<bold>1</bold>, <bold>2</bold>, and <bold>4</bold>) which showed promising PRC2-EED-I363M activation in order to better quantify how effectively these compounds activate PRC2-EED-I363M.

And, why is a similar compound <bold>3</bold> (UNC6083) an inhibitor, and not an activator, of both the mutant and wild type complexes? To address these questions, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of four molecular complexes, involving <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold>, each in complex with both PRC2-WT and PRC2-EED-I363M, followed by comparative analyses of the respective MD trajectories. The key finding of our computational simulations is that indeed the dynamics of ligand <bold>2</bold> in complex with PRC2-EED-I363M differs significantly from both the dynamics of <bold>2</bold> in complex with WT PRC2 and that of <bold>3</bold> with the mutant PRC2. In particular, the most distinctive feature of the dynamic behavior of compound <bold>2</bold> in PRC2-EED-I363M is the persistent ionic interactions between the unmodified lysine side chain of <bold>2</bold> and D140 located in a flexible loop of EZH2 (residues 136&#x02013;142), which drastically reduces the mobility of the loop, thus preserving the integrity of the adjacent SRM helix (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SI</xref> Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9&#x02013;11</xref>, and SI Movies&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). In WT PRC2, <bold>2</bold> is still able to form similar interactions with the EZH2 loop. However, these contacts are significantly less frequent than in the mutant complex, thereby preventing effective stabilization of the SRM helix (in a large fraction of the simulation time the SRM helix was in a partially unfolded state (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>)), which has been previously shown to be a key component of the EZH2 catalytically active state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In contrast with <bold>2</bold>, <bold>3</bold> has an overall lower propensity for ionic interactions with the 136&#x02013;142 loop of EZH2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SI</xref> Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S11</xref>).

First, compound <bold>2</bold> owes its activator potency in PRC2-EED-I363M to its ability to stabilize the SRM helix of EZH2, a key structural component of the catalytically active state. Due to a slightly different binding mode with EED, <bold>3</bold> does not induce SRM helix stabilization and, hence, does not show any activator effect on mutant PRC2. At the same time, since <bold>3</bold> competes for the same EED binding site with H3 and Jarid2, the endogenous PRC2 activators, it shows a dose-dependent inhibitory potency on the WT enzyme. Finally, the system involving compound <bold>2</bold> bound to PRC2-WT represents an intermediary case where the synthetic ligand can only intermittently stabilize the SRM helix, so that its activator potency does not exceed that of the endogenous peptide activators. Hence, <bold>2</bold> is &#x02018;invisible&#x02019; in the assay with the H3 peptide as the substrate. Additionally, the endogenous peptide is probably a better activator when whole nucleosomes are used as the substrate, thus making <bold>2</bold> appear as a weak inhibitor in this assay (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par18">We also sought to understand how the EED-I363M mutation reduces the sensitivity of PRC2 to its endogenous activators but favors the activator potency of <bold>2</bold>. A closer look at the EED mutation site shows that the mutant&#x02019;s methionine side chain (that occupies a significantly larger dynamic volume than the wild type isoleucine) significantly increases the mobility of the backbone atoms of the EED residues 362&#x02013;364. This higher mobility enabled the side chains of D362 and W364 to move closer to the positively charged pyrrolidine group of <bold>2</bold> and form respectively a salt bridge and a cation-&#x003c0; interaction (<bold><italic>d1</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>d2</italic></bold>, respectively, in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SI</xref> Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S15, S16</xref>). This same increased mobility of the EED residues 362&#x02013;364 appears to destabilize the endogenous activator&#x02019;s binding to EED leading to an overall decrease in PRC2 activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par19">We made use of structure-based design and computational simulations to develop small-molecule ligands able to selectively activate PRC2 carrying an oncogenic LOF mutation of its EED subunit.

The phenotypic outcome of EED-I363M in humans is hematologic malignancies caused by impaired propagation of repressive histone marks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, hence the discovery of allosteric activators for EED-I363M provides an approach to reverse the phenotype of this mutant.

Thus, further improvements in drug-like properties that permit cellular penetration are necessary to test whether allosteric activation of mutant PRC2 can be achieved in cells and whether this wouldindeedreverse the mutant phenotype.

The volta GPU nodes on UNC Longleaf supercomputer cluster were utilized. Each simulation was performed on a combination of 1 GPU and 8 associated CPUs, which provided the optimal recourses-speed correlation. The crystal structure of human PRC2 complex (PDB ID 5HYN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> was used as the starting structures in the simulations. Maestro Schr&#x000f6;dinger software (release 2016-2, Schr&#x000f6;dinger, LLC: New York, NY) was used for homology modeling of some of the missing loops in EZH2 and to perform I363M mutation in EED. The ligands were designed using Build function in Maestro starting from the structure of UNC4859 bound to EED (PDB ID 5TTW) upon alignment. The modified histone tail parameters compatible with CHARMM ff were obtained from Dejaegere <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and adapted for use in Gromacs. These parameters were necessary in order to correctly represent K116me3 of Jarid2 in our simulations.

The molecular systems were then solvated in TIP3P water, counterions were added for system neutrality, and NaCl was added by replacing water molecules in order to mimic 0.15&#x02009;M physiological conditions. The total system size became ~230,000 atoms. Solvent minimization was then performed, followed by a two-step equilibration, during which all heavy atoms of the system, excluding those of water and counterions, were restrained: 0.1&#x02009;ns in NVT ensemble using the modified Berendsen thermostat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> set at constant 310&#x02009;K, and 1&#x02009;ns in NPT ensemble at constant 1&#x02009;atm and 310&#x02009;K using the Parinello-Rahman pressure coupling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. All simulations were conducted using the Leapfrog integrator in periodic boundary conditions. The 12-6 Lennard-Jones potential was used to describe the vdW interactions, and the nonbonded cutoff distance was set at 0.1&#x02009;nm. The particle mesh Ewald algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> controlled the long-range electrostatic interactions.

Fmoc protecting group on Fmoc Rink amide resin was first removed in a solution of 2.5% 1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene (DBU) and 2.5% pyrrolidine in 8&#x02009;mL of DMF for 10&#x02009;min. Then, the resin was filtered and washed twice with DMF, methanol, DMF, and DCM (8&#x02009;mL each) before adding the first amino acid for coupling. Fmoc-protected amino acids (3 eq) except Fmoc-Arg(Pmc)-OH were preactivated with HBTU (3 eq), HOAt (3 eq), and DIPEA (10 eq) for 5&#x02009;minutes with periodic swirling in 5&#x02009;mL of DMF and 3&#x02009;mL of DCM. For Fmoc-Arg(Pmc)-OH coupling, we avoided this longer pre-incubation to prevent formation of the intramolecular cyclization by-product.
