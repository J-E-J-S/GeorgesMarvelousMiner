The recent resurgence of interest in the field of cancer metabolism involves numerous findings of metabolic alterations in a variety of pathways in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These metabolic adaptations are directly regulated by growth-promoting signaling pathways, in which somatic mutations drive tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

Recent pan-cancer loss-of-function screens of hundreds of cancer cell lines have identified novel oncogenes involved in cell signaling pathways.

In the genetic screen by McDonald et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], a similar difficulty to predict cell line-specific dependence on metabolic genes was shown. A notable example of cell line-specific dependency on a metabolic enzyme-coding gene that is explainable based on gene expression is that of TYMS (thymidylate synthase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], where TYMS was found to be essential in cell lines where its expression level is low (hence, cells may be limited for thymidylate needed for DNA biosynthesis) while the expression of TYMP (thymidine phosphorylase) is high (further depleting thymidylate pools).</p><p id="Par7">Here, we aimed to generate predictive models for cell line-specific dependence on metabolic genes based on genomic features, providing insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms.

We focused on metabolic genes whose dependency scores showed major variation throughout the cell lines, considering those whose dependency score in at least one cell line is lower by more than six standard deviations from the mean of each gene as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] (a low dependency score of a gene in a certain cell line reflects increased essentiality). We find that the RNAi-based dependency scores of 37% (22/59) of the analyzed metabolic genes are significantly associated with the utilized culture media (FDR-corrected Wilcoxon <italic>p</italic> value &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) versus 18% of the non-metabolic genes (135/754, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c).

The metabolic gene that showed the strongest dependence on culture media in both RNAi and CRISPR screens was ASNS (asparagine synthase, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e, f) and found to be significantly more essential in cells grown in DMEM (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>g, h; FDR-corrected Wilcoxon <italic>p</italic> value &#x0003c;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;12</sup> and 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> for the RNAi and CRISPR screens, respectively, comparing the distribution of dependency scores in cell lines grown in DMEM and RPMI). This is readily explainable by the lack of asparagine in DMEM, rendering ASNS essential for de novo asparagine biosynthesis under this culture media.

Indeed, we found that ~&#x02009;90% and ~&#x02009;30% of the adherent and suspension cell lines from the genetic screens were grown in DMEM and RPMI, respectively. However, the correlation between metabolic gene dependency scores and media type remained highly significant when controlling for the cell culture type; for ~&#x02009;90% of the metabolic genes whose RNAi- or CRISPR-based dependency score correlate with media type, the correlation remains significant when controlling for cell culture type (FDR-corrected Spearman partial correlation <italic>p</italic> value &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).

We find that the expression level of neighboring enzymes is the top predictive feature of gene dependency in both RNAi (~&#x02009;50%) and CRISPR (34%) screens (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c, d). Surprisingly, the expression level of the gene itself is the top predictive feature of RNAi- and CRISPR-based dependency scores in only ~&#x02009;10% and 8% of the metabolic genes, respectively, emphasizing the importance of analyzing the expression of interconnected enzymes in the metabolic network. Media type is the top predictive feature for another ~&#x02009;5% and ~&#x02009;11% of the metabolic genes with the RNAi and CRISPR screens, respectively. In comparison, oncogenic mutations were found to be the top predictive feature of RNAi- and CRISPR-based gene dependency for less than 5% of the metabolic genes (though oncogenic mutations have important predictive value when combined with other molecular features; among the top 5 predictive features of up to 40% of the metabolic genes).</p><p id="Par17">Among the known oncogenic mutations, BRAF and KRAS mutations are the most frequently observed alterations within the top 5 predictive features of the RNAi-based (6%) and CRISPR-based (8%) metabolic gene dependency (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e), followed by TP53 (~&#x02009;4%) for both screens. This is in agreement with major metabolic reprogramming known to be regulated by oncogenic mutations in these genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Among cancer lineages, leukemia is the most frequent cancer type within the top 5 predictive features of the RNAi screen (10%), followed by melanoma in both screens (8%, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f).</p><p id="Par18">Integrating multiple molecular and cancer lineage features within a predictive model for gene dependency reveals numerous important predictive features that cannot otherwise be inferred when analyzing each feature individually (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>g, h). For example, for 18 metabolic genes, we find that their gene expression level is an important predictive feature of RNAi-based cell line dependence (within the top 5 predictive features), while no significant correlation is found between their expression and dependency score across all cell lines. We find that the top predictive feature of RNAi-based cell line dependency for DAD1 (involved in <italic>N</italic>-glycan synthesis) is its expression level, while no significant correlation is found between DAD1 expression level and its dependency score across all cell lines (Spearman <italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.03, <italic>p</italic> value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.57). Considering that the mutation status of NOTCH1 is also within the top 5 predictive features of DAD1, we find a significant correlation between DAD1 expression and its dependency score when focusing on NOTCH1-mutated cell lines (Spearman <italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;0.35, <italic>p</italic> value &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). This is consistent with the known important role of glycosylation in Notch signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], suggesting that in cancer cell driven by NOTCH1 mutation, high DAD1 expression level indicates high dependence on its function.</p><p id="Par19">The generated predictive models enable raising hypotheses regarding specific metabolic mechanisms that underlie cell line-specific dependence on metabolic genes. For example, we present predictive models generated for RNAi-based dependency on genes involved in one-carbon metabolism. This metabolic system has long been a target for chemotherapy and has recently been shown to involve substantial metabolic rewiring that can be targeted for therapeutic purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. We find an increased dependency of leukemia cell lines on MTHFD1 (cytosolic methylene-tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase) where the expression of MTHFR (methylene-THF reductase) that consumes 5,10-methylene-THF is high, and the expression of FTCD (formimidoyltransferase cyclodeaminase) that produces 5,10-methylene-THF as part of histidine catabolism is low (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). This suggests that maintaining the high activity of MTHFD1 is required to overcome a potential depletion of its substrate 5,10-methylene-THF in these conditions. Increased dependence on ALDH1L1 (cytosolic formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase) is found in KRAS-mutated cell lines where MTHFD1 copy number is high, potentially to facilitate the regeneration of THF from 10-formyl-THF (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). Increased dependency on SHMT2 (mitochondrial serine-hydroxymethyl-transferase) is found in cell lines with increased expression of AMT (a subunit of the glycine-cleavage system; localized in mitochondria) and of MTHFD2 (mitochondrial methylene-tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). This might occur in the face of a high demand rate for mitochondrial one-carbon units, requiring both serine and glycine catabolic activities. In cells where the expression of MTHFD2 is high, increased dependency on MTHFD1L might be needed to support mitochondrial formate production from 10-formyl-THF, facilitating the shuttling of one-carbon units to cytosol to support purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Predictive models for cell line-specific dependence on genes in one-carbon metabolism.

Since the development of RNAi- and CRISPR-based gene-silencing techniques, both approaches have been systematically applied for screening the gene knockdown and knockout effects in numerous cell lines. To identify genes whose perturbation would selectively affect cancer cells, gene-silencing profiles are typically integrated with tumor-specific mutations and alterations in gene expression to identify a specific molecular marker indicative of cancer cell dependence on a target gene. This is typically referred to as synthetic lethality or synthetic dosage lethality, where a perturbation of a single gene is viable but the perturbation of both genes is lethal to cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The identification of such synthetic lethal gene pairs provides a patient stratification strategy based on the mutation or expression status of one gene where the drug targeting of its partner gene enables selective eradication of cancer cells while minimizing toxic side effects. Previous studies suggest going beyond the search for synthetic lethal pairs, generating predictive models of gene essentiality in cancer cells based on multiple molecular features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, as shown here, the ability to generate such predictive models for metabolic genes was significantly limited compared to other non-metabolic genes.</p><p id="Par21">Analyzing genetic silencing screen data from recent RNAi and CRISPR screens, we found a confounding effect of culture media on cell line-specific response to the silencing of especially metabolic genes. Our finding is consistent with recent studies, demonstrating the major effect of the tumor microenvironment in determining the cancer cellular metabolic phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In fact, several recent attempts have been made to develop culture media which would more closely mimic nutrient availability and concentration as in human plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Our results, showing that the specific choice of media affects cell line dependence on metabolic genes, call for future genetic screens to maintain a similar culture media for different cell lines, optimally matching the true physiological conditions. Predictive models for cell line dependence on specific genes are not only important for potential usage as a patient stratification tool, but also useful for studying the molecular mechanisms that underlie cell line-specific metabolic activities. Hence, taking into account the culture media in our analysis, the generated predictive models are readily available for researchers interested in exploring cancer cell line dependence on specific metabolic genes. As shown, the integration of multiple molecular and cancer lineage features within a predictive model for gene dependency reveals numerous important predictive molecular features that cannot otherwise be inferred.</p><p id="Par22">Another factor that complicates the finding of molecular features explaining cell line-specific gene dependence is the substantially high number of candidate predictive features: Specifically, the ability to identify synthetic lethality by analyzing the correlation between the dependency score of a certain gene and a large set of molecular feature suffers from multiple hypothesis testing, and the generation of predictive models via machine learning while considering a high number of features is complicated by overfitting. The incorporation of prior knowledge regarding feature relevance was previously shown highly useful for limiting the number of candidate predictive features and increasing statistical power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Here, we show that a measure of functional relatedness of metabolic genes, defined based on connectivity in a metabolic network, is highly useful for generating predictive models for metabolic genes. Overall, utilizing this measure and also considering culture media composition, resulted in a 2.2-fold increase in the number of generated predictive models for metabolic genes compared to those derived as part of the Cancer Dependency Map [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Notably, while we were able to generate significant predictive models for cell line specific dependence on ~&#x02009;30% of the analyzed metabolic genes by integrating multiple molecular features, additional molecular characterization of the analyzed cell lines is expected to enable expanding this to other genes. Specifically, considering that metabolic activity is controlled beyond genomic and transcriptomic levels, additional high-throughput measurements of epigenetic modifications, proteomics, and metabolomics are expected to be highly useful in closing the gap.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par24">Culture media has a significant confounding effect on cell line-specific response to the silencing of metabolic genes, which should be taken into account when analyzing results from gene-silencing screens.
