For the first time, we report here that the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type I Enhancer Binding Protein 2 (HIVEP2) is a dopaminergic transcriptional regulator. HIVEP2 is expressed in both the cytoplasm and nuclei of DA neurons. Therein, HIVEP2 can target the intronic sequence GTGGCTTTCT of <italic>SLC6A3</italic> and thereby activate the gene. In naive rats from the bi-directional selectively bred substance-preferring P vs -nonpreferring NP rat model of substance abuse vulnerability, increased gene activity in males was associated with the vulnerability, whereas decreased gene activity in the females was associated with the same vulnerability. In clinical subjects, extensive and significant <italic>HIVEP2-SLC6A3</italic> interactions were observed for SUD. Collectively, HIVEP2-mediated transcriptional mechanisms are implicated in dopaminergic pathophysiology of SUD.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Molecular neuroscience</kwd><kwd>Addiction</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Health &#x00026; Human Services | NIH | National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA021409</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Zhicheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Many environmental factors can regulate dopaminergic (DAergic) activity including <italic>SLC6A3</italic>, the gene encoding the dopamine transporter (DAT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. These regulations remain mechanistically poorly understood. A critical step in dissecting these mechanisms is to identify what transcription factors (TFs) target the DAergic genome. Recently, several TFs for <italic>SLC6A3</italic> have been cloned, including Nurr1 (NR4A2), paired-like homeobox 3 protein (PITX3), HEY1, SP1, SP3, <sup>AZI2</sup>3&#x02032;UTR, SRP54, and Nfe2l1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. It is postulated that HEY1 is a TF targeting the 3&#x02032;UTR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, whereas the others appear to target 5&#x02032; promoter regions except <sup>AZI2</sup>3&#x02019;UTR, a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), that regulates Intron 1 of <italic>SLC6A3</italic>. Among these TFs, Nurr1, but not PITX3, is implicated in Parkinson&#x02019;s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and <sup>AZI2</sup>3&#x02032;UTR is implicated in substance use disorder (SUD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Importantly, both diseases are closely associated with altered DAergic activity. These findings indicate that identification of DAergic TFs may provide opportunities for dissecting signaling pathways that target these TFs for genomic action. This would help clarify molecular cascades underlying neuronal development, plasticity and DAergic transcription-related disorders such as SUD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The present study focused on delineation of new transcription mechanisms in SUD, using <italic>SLC6A3</italic> as a prototype target to clone DAergic TFs.
