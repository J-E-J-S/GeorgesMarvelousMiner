In <italic>E. coli</italic>, a large number of transcription termination events are Rho-dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Rho is a homo-hexameric RNA-dependent ATPase that binds to nascent RNA by recognizing the <italic>rut</italic> site (rho utilization site; a C-rich unstructured stretch of the nascent RNA) and uses the energy obtained from the ATP hydrolysis to translocate along the RNA. Eventually it catches up the elongation complex (EC) and dissociates it<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Transcription elongation factor, NusG, interacts with Rho and stimulates the termination process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Recent studies have revealed that by the virtue of its RNA-binding property and due to the all-pervading nature of the Rho-dependent termination, the Rho protein is found to be involved in the various physiological processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">During the bacterial growth, its DNA can be damaged by several extraneous physical (radiations) or chemical factors (hazardous chemicals or metabolites). To cope up with these stresses and to maintain the integrity of the DNA, bacteria have evolved the base excision repair (BER) system to remove single base aberrations and the nucleotide excision repair (NER) to remove large DNA lesions and the abasic sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. NER initiates with the recognition of the DNA damage site by UvrAB complex following which the UvrA protein dissociates from the complex leaving behind the UvrB that recruits a nuclease, UvrC. UvrC cleaves the DNA fragment on the either side of the DNA lesions. UvrD, a helicase, unwinds the excised fragment and removes it. Later, the DNA polymerase fills in the gap and the DNA ligase seals the newly synthesized DNA to complete the repair process (see figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). In bacteria, NER is classified as global genomic repair (GGR) and transcription coupled repair (TCR) processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. GGR pathway is a general DNA repair pathway that acts on the random genomic lesions, whereas the TCR is a DNA repair pathway that removes lesions from the transcribed strand of the expressed genes. In the latter process, the elongating RNAP stalls at the DNA lesions and acts like a signal for the recruitment of the NER-machinery to the damaged site. Mfd, a DNA translocase, dislodges stalled RNAP in order to expose the DNA lesions, and also has the ability to recruit the NER-protein, UvrA, through its N-terminal UvrB homology domain to initiate the repair process (<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">supplementary figure 1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. A whole body of literature has provided evidence that Mfd plays a pivotal role in initiation of the TCR, especially in repairing the damages of the transcribing strand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, in an alternative model, it has been claimed that a Mfd-independent pathway is also operational to dislodge the RNAP, where UvrD together with NusA induce the backtracking of the stalled ECs so that the DNA lesions are exposed to the other Uvr proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The transcription elongation is a discontinuous process. Depending on the DNA sequence and structures, the transcription elongation slows down or the RNAP stalls at the specific pause sites, which has various physiological consequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Besides this, elongating RNAPs stall at DNA damaged sites that are caused by physical and chemical agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Stalled EC, not only masks the damaged sites from the DNA repair but also could cause general hindrance to several DNA-dependent processes, which in turn would cause lethality. Therefore, it is essential to remove stalled RNAP from these DNA lesions.</p><p id="Par6">In a rapidly growing cell most of the RNA polymerases (RNAPs) are engaged in both the operonic and the non-operonic or the pervasive transcriptions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Hence, the elongating RNAP is thought to function as a global scanner of the DNA lesions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. <italic>E. coli</italic> has ~1400 Rho molecules, which is nearly equimolar to the number of the elongating RNAPs ECs (~1250 per cell) in a cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. So, it is likely that a significant fraction of the ECs will be the target of the Rho, especially those engaged in the non-operonic transcriptions. Consistent with that idea, recently it has been shown that one of the major roles of Rho is to prevent the pervasive transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Earlier, we have shown that Rho can dislodge stalled ECs in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Hence, we hypothesized that Rho, by inducing transcription termination, is capable of recycling the RNAP stalled at the DNA lesions and thereby, might facilitate the repair of the damaged sites by unmasking them to the DNA repair machineries, and in this regard, it resembles the RNAP displacement activity of the Mfd (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Failure of the Rho-mediated recycling of RNAPs would lead to lethality.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Hypothesis of connecting Rho-dependent termination and NER<italic>:</italic> Cartoons depicting (<bold>a</bold>) operonic (transcription starting from the promotor region of a gene) and pervasive (transcription starting from other cryptic start sites) transcription. <bold>b</bold> RNAP as a global scanner for DNA damage: By virtue of the pervasive as well as the operonic transcriptions, RNAP could encounter the DNA lesions in a genome-wide fashion, and thus could act as a global sensor for the DNA damages. <bold>c</bold> Probable mode of invoking NER processes by Rho by displacing the stalled transcription elongation complexes at the lesions.

The Rho protein is efficient in releasing RNA from stalled ECs at the DNA lesions in in vitro transcription assays in a similar fashion as the Mfd protein.

Also, failure of the RNAP-recycling is likely to lead to the reduction of survival of the cells.

Determination of synthetic defects is a very useful tool to establish the genetic interactions between the two gene products.

The initiation of the NER pathway depends on the dislodging of the ECs stalled at the UV-dose-induced thymine dimers. To further confirm the involvement of Rho-dependent termination in removing these stalled complexes, we monitored the UV-dose sensitivity of the strains expressing the Rho mutants, as well as the strains having deletions in the <italic>uvrA, uvrD</italic>, and <italic>mfd</italic>.

So, if the stalled ECs are displaced by Rho, instead of Mfd, how could the Uvr proteins be recruited to the DNA damaged site?

This result may suggest that Rho and Mfd function cooperatively to dislodge the ECs stalled at the DNA lesion sites.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Rho releases RNA from the stalled ECs at the DNA lesions</title><p id="Par19">By the virtue of the EC-dislodging properties of Rho, similar phenotypes of the Rho mutants like the <italic>mfd</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;</italic></sup> strains and high mutual dependence of both the <italic>rho</italic> and <italic>mfd</italic> during the in vivo DNA repair process, strongly indicate that Rho protein is capable of removing the stalled ECs from the DNA lesions in a similar fashion as the Mfd protein.</p><p id="Par20">To directly test this proposition, we designed Mfd-induced and Rho-induced in vitro RNA release (a measure of RNAP recycling) assays from the ECs stalled at the DNA lesions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). We used a linearized 5&#x02032;-biotinylated DNA having a strong T7A1 promoter. On this template, transcription initiates from this promoter and elongates through a Rho-dependent terminator region, <italic>trpt&#x02019;</italic>, and the template is immobilized on the streptavidin-coated magnetic beads via a biotin linkage. This DNA template was exposed to UV-radiation (200&#x02009;J&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) that resulted in the formation of several T&#x02013;T dimer (thymine-dimer adducts; stars in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). We confirmed the existence of these adducts by the sensitivity of this damaged template to an enzyme called, T4-PDG (from bacteriophage T4, pyrimidine dimer glycosylase; NEB) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>, third lane). We then proceeded with the transcription reactions on this template, both in the presence and absence of either Rho or Mfd proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c, d</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>In vitro transcription assays to measure RNA release. <bold>a</bold> Cartoon showing the DNA template used for the study.

We concluded that like Mfd, Rho is also capable of dislodging stalled ECs at the DNA lesions. However, Rho is not capable of recruiting Uvr proteins to the damaged sites.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Comparison of RNA release efficiencies between Mfd and Rho</title><p id="Par22">We have earlier reported that the Rho prefers transcriptionally active stalled ECs to release RNA and the RNA-release kinetics is significantly slower from the arrested or backtracked ECs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The covalent adducts of T&#x02013;T dimers are quite stable and induces backtracking as was evident from the sensitivity of the stalled ECs at the lesions towards the GreB (Supplementary figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>b and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5c</xref>). In the previous section, we observed in the steady-state measurements that the Rho-induced RNA release efficiency from these stalled ECs was ~20% less than what was observed in the presence of the Mfd. Hence, we looked into the RNA release kinetics from the ECs stalled at the T&#x02013;T dimers under various in vitro conditions to assess the mechanistic differences between the mode of functions of these two terminators.</p><p id="Par23">We formed two types of stalled ECs; one at the T&#x02013;T dimer lesions (similar to those in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and in supplementary figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a</xref>) and the another one at LacI bound to a lac operator site (see supplementary figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6b</xref>). The latter one remains transcriptionally active and is a good substrate for Rho to act upon as was shown by us earlier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. We calculated the average of the fractions of RNA release from the ECs stalled at five different T&#x02013;T dimers inside the termination zone both in the presence and the absence of either Rho or Mfd (denoted as * in supplementary figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a</xref>) proteins. In separate assays, we measured the fractions of RNA release from the stalled EC (RB) at a LacI bound site on the template (supplementary figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6b</xref>). We observed that the speed of RNA release is significantly faster from the stalled ECs at the T&#x02013;T dimer in the presence of Mfd (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>), whereas Rho induces very fast RNA release from the transcriptionally active RB (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Therefore, already backtracked ECs at the T&#x02013;T DNA lesions are not very good substrates for the Rho as compared to the Mfd. So, to efficiently remove RNAPs from these lesions in vivo, Rho should act instantaneously as soon as the transcription elongation is blocked or should be dependent on the actions of the transcription anti-arrest factors like, GreA and GreB. However, Mfd is capable of performing the same function independently of these anti-arrest factors.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Kinetics of Rho and Mfd induced RNA release from the stalled ECs at the T&#x02013;T dimers<italic>:</italic> Fractions of either Rho-induced or Mfd-induced RNA released from the ECs stalled at the T&#x02013;T dimers (<bold>a</bold>) or at a LacI-LacO road-block site (<bold>b</bold>) were plotted against the time.

Slow removal of the ECs could also lead to replication&#x02013;transcription collision affecting the overall genome integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Here, using tools to study synthetic growth defects, in vivo assays for the sensitivity to the DNA damaging agents and in vitro RNA and RNAP release assays, we have proved that Rho-dependent termination is capable of recycling RNAPs from the ECs stalled at the damaged sites. This recycling of RNAPs by Rho in turn invokes NER, prevents replication&#x02013;transcription collision and other DNA-dependent processes, which is essential for the survival of the bacteria. We have furnished the following lines of evidences to establish our claim. (1) Rho and NusG mutants compromised for the transcription termination functions cause mild (for the <italic>uvrA, uvrB, uvrC</italic>, and <italic>uvrD</italic>) to severe (for <italic>mfd</italic>) growth defects in combination with the deletion of different NER genes (Fig.<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). (2) Strains expressing Rho mutants are significantly sensitive to DNA-damage-inducing physical and chemical agents (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a&#x02013;e</xref>), and are inefficient in repairing the plasmid DNA damages and/or its propagation in vivo (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). (3) Similar to Mfd, Rho is capable of releasing the nascent RNA as well as dislodging the stalled ECs at the T&#x02013;T dimers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).&#x000a0;(4) Combination of a Rho mutant and the <italic>mfd</italic> deletion amplified the sensitivity of the strains towards UV&#x000a0;by several fold as compared to that observed when only Mfd function was compromised (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Aforementioned results also allow us to propose that Rho either augments or competes with Mfd when the latter is present, and it may complement the function when the latter is absent. Since a constitutively functioning derivative of Mfd was able to suppress the combinatorial defects of Rho mutants and the Mfd deletion (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), there is a possibility that these two terminators might function in tandem to recycle the trapped RNAPs and unmask the DNA lesions for the subsequent repair steps to occur. Because the removal of the ECs and the exposure of the DNA lesions to the Uvr proteins have to be performed with extreme efficiency and speed, synergy between them would be hugely beneficial to the cells.</p><p id="Par25">Even though the dislodging of the ECs from the DNA lesion sites are essential, surprisingly, Mfd, the only protein so far known to be responsible for this is not an essential protein in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and <italic>mfd</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;</italic></sup> strain has a milder sensitivity towards DNA-damaging agents (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. To solve this puzzle, recently it was proposed that UvrD, a DNA helicase and a component of the TCR pathway, induces backward movement of the RNAP and opens up the access of the DNA lesions to the other Uvr proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, thereby renders requirement of Mfd redundant. However, this claim was contested in the subsequent publications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Here, we believe that inclusion of another terminator, the Rho protein, in recycling step(s) of the RNAPs from the DNA lesions, solves the puzzle of the less dependence of the <italic>E. coli</italic> on the Mfd protein. We propose that in the absence of the Mfd, Rho dislodges the stalled ECs and let the repair process continue unhindered. This is the major reasons for the observed synthetic growth defect when both the <italic>rho</italic> and <italic>mfd</italic> functions are compromised (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and &#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). By the virtue of its termination properties, Rho facilitates the DNA repair process, thereby contributes immensely in the survival of the bacteria.</p><p id="Par26">Although both the Rho and the Mfd proteins dislodge ECs, there are distinct mechanistic differences in the way they function. One of the major roles of Mfd in TCR is to recruit the UvrA protein to the damaged site (see supplementary figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), which is the most important step to assemble other Uvr proteins and initiate the subsequent reactions. Rho is not capable of recruiting the Uvr proteins, and hence, in the absence of Mfd, Rho technically cannot initiate the TCR process, instead it might invoke the GGR (see supplementary figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) path, where Uvr proteins are drawn to the exposed DNA lesions passively. However, in the presence of Mfd, both these terminators might function synergistically as described before.</p><p id="Par27">In addition to the aforementioned limitation, Rho can only dislodge the ECs stalled at the DNA lesions that are inside the termination zone of a Rho terminator. There is an a priori requirement of a terminator region (including the Rho-loading sites) for the Rho protein to function, whereas the Mfd is more versatile and can act on any stalled ECs (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The Rho is more efficient to dislodge the transcriptionally active ECs, whereas it appears that the Mfd has evolved to function preferentially on arrested and backtracked complexes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). This difference arises because one is a RNA helicase and the other is a DNA translocase. Rho dislodges the EC by pulling the RNA out of the active site either by the tethered tracking or by the simple tracking modes of its translocase activity along the RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and the mechanism may also involve a direct collision of RNAP and Rho<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. A transcriptionally active EC is likely to have a relatively unstable RNA:DNA hybrid because of its inherent dynamic nature, from which pulling out the mRNA might be easier than an arrested EC, where the RNA protrudes into the secondary channel (NTP entry channel)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and have additional interactions inside this channel. The Mfd protein destabilizes the RNAP by forward translocating it along the DNA template<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, thereby it is likely to be more effective on the arrested complexes at the DNA lesions. The Rho-dependent termination is a genome-wide phenomenon and majority of the operons are the targets of Rho<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, therefore most of the ECs would be associated with the Rho rendering its availability to the DNA lesion sites.</p><p id="Par28">In the synthetic growth defect assays, the <italic>uvrD</italic> deletion exhibited milder effect with the Rho and the NusG mutants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), indicating that both the Rho and the uvrD helicase may not be genetically connected during the repair process. In the mechanistic term, the DNA unwinding step performed by UvrD following the RNAP/RNA release is not dependent on the Rho function. Even if the UvrD is involved in pulling back RNAP from the DNA lesions site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, the Rho would function independently of this phenomenon. However, because the backtracked ECs are poor substrates for the Rho protein, it is likely to function more synergistically with the Mfd rather than with the UvrD.</p><p id="Par29">Apparent less-specificity of the RNA sites (the <italic>rut</italic> sites) recognized by the Rho helicase subjects a wide range of operons as well as non-operonic regions to be its targets, thereby bringing the expression of a huge number of genes under the control of Rho. All the genomic data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> indicate that the inhibition of Rho induces expression of a whole set of new genes, which changes the physiology of the cell. Therefore, it is not surprising that Rho is involved in so many physiological processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, and the present study adds one more crucial function of Rho to this list. The functions of this transcription terminator are an interesting example, where pleotropicity is a boon to the system and favored over the usual specificity that makes the hallmark of the biological systems. We surmise that the Rho protein functions as a &#x0201c;master-regulator&#x0201d; of various physiological processes of bacteria and should be considered as a potent drug target.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par30">The reagents for the in vitro transcription reactions (Tris&#x02013;Cl, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, KCl, DEPC-treated water) were purchased from Ambion.

The efficiency of in vivo DNA repair was determined by the fractions of transformants obtained for each strain with respect to the transformants of the same strain obtained with the unexposed plasmid and was plotted against the UV dose.

On this template, the transcription initiates from a strong T7A1 promoter, and contains a T-less sequence in its first 22 bases so that in the absence of UTP in the reaction mixture, a 23-mer stalled elongation complex (EC<sub>23</sub>) could be formed. The DNA template was exposed to various UV doses in an UV crosslinker (CL-1000 UV Crosslinkers, Ultra-Violet Products Ltd., Cambridge, UK). We chose the UV dose of 200&#x02009;J&#x02009;m<sup><italic>&#x02212;</italic>2</sup> as it gave an optimum number of T&#x02013;T dimers along the template. Formation of T&#x02013;T dimer were determined from the sensitivity of the UV-exposed template to the enzyme T4-PDG (NEB, USA). The UV exposed templates were immobilized on the streptavidin-coated magnetic beads through the 5&#x02032;-biotin and then used for the in vitro transcription assays. The EC<sub>23</sub> was formed by mixing 5&#x02009;nM DNA template, 25&#x02009;nM RNA polymerase in the transcription buffer (25&#x02009;mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.0, 5&#x02009;mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50&#x02009;mM KCl, 1&#x02009;mM DTT, and 0.1&#x02009;mg/ml of BSA) and 175&#x02009;&#x000b5;M ApU, 5&#x02009;&#x000b5;M GTP, 5&#x02009;&#x000b5;M ATP, 2.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;M CTP, and [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]CTP (3000&#x02009;Ci/mmol; Jonaki, BRIT, Hyderabad). The EC<sub>23</sub> was then chased with 250&#x02009;&#x000b5;M each of ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP for 2&#x02009;min. Under this experimental condition, a series of stalled ECs were observed to form on the UV-exposed templates. To these stalled complexes, either 100&#x02009;nM of WT Rho or 100&#x02009;nM Mfd were added and were incubated for 5&#x02009;min. Released RNA was separated from the RNA bound to the EC by holding the tube against a magnetic stand. Half of the supernatant (S) was collected and other half of reaction mixture along with pellet (S+P) was subjected to phenol extraction. Both the samples were then mixed with equal volume of denaturing RNA loading dye, heated at 95&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 2&#x02009;min and run on 8% Urea&#x02013;PAGE. Amount of RNA released in each fraction was estimated by the signal intensity of the different bands in the supernatant and pellet fractions as measured by ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.).

To pause transcription by nucleotide depletion, the EC<sub>23</sub> was chased with only 2.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;M NTPs. To study the RNA release from the EC stalled at a protein road block, we amplified the transcription template from plasmid pRS106 using primer RS83 as forward primer and RS177 as reverse primer. Primer RS177 carries LacO sequence at 3&#x02032;-end to provide the binding site for LacI protein. To create the protein road-block, 300&#x02009;nM LacI was added in the transcription reaction before the formation of the EC<sub>23</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>RNA release kinetic assays</title><p id="Par41">RNA release kinetic assays were performed in a similar manner as described above except that the aliquots of reaction mixtures were taken out at different time points.

The fractions of RNA released were calculated as above and plotted against time. To assess the extent of backtracking of the stalled ECs at the different T&#x02013;T dimer sites, we added 500&#x02009;nM GreB at different time points after formation of the ECs and removing the NTPs (supplementary figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a and b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Reporting summary</title><p id="Par42">Further information on experimental design is available in the&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">Nature Research Reporting Summary</xref> linked to this article.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>
