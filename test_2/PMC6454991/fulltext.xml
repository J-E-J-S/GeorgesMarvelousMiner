Anti-influenza drugs are efficient in treating influenza virus infection, yet they fail to provide complete protection due to frequent emergence of drug-resistant influenza viruses.<xref rid="b4-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Furthermore, anti-influenza drug must be taken within 48 hours after the onset of symptoms to obtain a clinically successful rapid response.<xref rid="b5-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza virus is a structural protein which encapsidates the negative-strand viral RNA. Among eight gene segments of type A influenza virus, NP gene is highly conserved.<xref rid="b7-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Therefore, NP may be targeted for the development of genetic therapy for influenza virus infection.</p><p>RNAi is a sequence-specific biological process in which short (21&#x02013;26 nucleotides), double-stranded RNA molecules inhibit the expression of target genes through a series of steps after the formation of RNAi-induced silencing complex.<xref rid="b8-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In the past decades, RNAi technique was also introduced into antivirus research. An array of siRNAs have been designed to interfere with the expression of gene segments of influenza viruses and have been shown to inhibit the replication of influenza virus in mammalian cells and mouse model.<xref rid="b12-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, with negative charge, it is hard for siRNA to access intracellular active site. To address this issue, a plethora of delivery platforms have been developed. Current delivery tools for siRNA are cationic lipid and virus-based vectors, but the latter has been facing problems when used in clinical trials. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), consisting of a class of highly effective short peptides, are able to penetrate cell membranes and transport different components into cells with high efficiency.<xref rid="b15-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> When CPPs non-covalently bind to oligonucleotides and form non-covalent nanoparticles, they retain the translocation properties.<xref rid="b17-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> These short, synthetic peptide-based vectors were considered as biocompatible and economical candidates for the delivery of therapeutic oligonu-cleotides.<xref rid="b20-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Binding potent agents to CPPs has been suggested to improve their entry into cells and bioavailability.<xref rid="b21-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b23-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Among the published CPPs, transportan (TP), a 27 amino acid chimeric peptide which is a combination of N terminal fragment of neuropeptide galanin and membrane interacting wasp venom peptide mastoparan, is an effective cargo delivery tool with low cytotoxicity.<xref rid="b24-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Several results have shown that analogs and derivatives of TP can transport small proteins and DNA and RNA oligomers into cells via direct membrane interactions (transient pore formation),<xref rid="b26-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> however, inefficiently.

In vitro studies showed that T9(dR) induced efficient transportation of siRNA into a variety of cell lines with low toxicity and high efficiency. This occurred when the cell lines were treated with a complex of T9(dR) and siRNA. In addition, in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that T9(dR) delivered siNP into epithelial cells in respiratory tract and inhibited replication of influenza virus more efficiently than TP. These results showed that T9(dR) is an interesting vector for siRNA delivery which shows an intriguing perspective for therapy of influenza virus infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture, influenza virus, and mice</title><p>Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells (CCL-34; American Type Culture Collection [ATCC], Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1&#x000d7; nonessential amino acids, 5 &#x000b5;g/mL gentamycin sulfate, and 4 mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

Although influenza vaccines and anti-influenza drugs provide protection, their efficacies are inconsistent. Vaccination is an effective way to prevent infection by influenza viruses. Reportedly, there was 50% mismatch between the seasonal influenza viruses and seasonal influenza vaccines from 1997 to 2005.<xref rid="b38-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> In addition, the poor coverage of vaccination makes the prophylaxis of influenza ineffective. The mutation of neuraminidase (NA) also created a lot of oseltamivir-resistant influenza strains;<xref rid="b39-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> hence, reinforcing development of new prophylactic and therapeutic tools is necessary according to the surveillance results of annual influenza epidemic.</p><p>siRNA, as a potent tool to inhibit expression of target gene, has been investigated intensively in therapeutics. The siRNAs against conserved regions of the influenza gene segments are powerful promising tools to inhibit replication of influenza virus through degradation of target mRNA.<xref rid="b14-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b40-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> However, naked siRNA was rapidly destroyed by serum nuclease. Due to the large size and anionic charge, the major impediment for therapeutic use of siRNAs is the lack of effective platform to deliver siRNA to desired cell types in vivo.<xref rid="b41-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Most of the current siRNA delivery implements are chemical regents and often exhibit unbalanced toxicity in both in vitro and in vivo trials. CPPs demonstrate a greater efficiency for the delivery of siRNAs. So far, many CPPs are identified from variable sources. Usually, the CPPs are 5&#x02013;30 amino acids in length. However, how the length and structure affect the transportation ability of CPPs is still unknown.<xref rid="b42-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> siRNAs binding to CPP form nanoparticles and confer resistance to nuclease degradation; however, the nanoparticles are driven by electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction creating instability in liquid environment. Thus, it is crucial to enhance the biological stability of the nanopar-ticles in biological fluids for a system with better delivery efficiency. Several methods were employed to increase the stability in vivo.<sup>43&#x02013;46</sup> In this study, we developed T9(dR) for effective delivery of siRNA in vivo. Initially, results of gel retardation showed that T9(dR) and siRNA bind properly when the ratio was &#x0003e;4:1 and the effective binding ratio of siGFP to TP is 16:1. Here, we did not know the binding mechanism of T9(dR) and siRNA. Nevertheless, we hypothesized that it might be related to the charge and size of peptide. As a chimeric peptide, T9(dR) is longer than most of the published CPPs. The structure of CPPs is very complex. Correspondingly, T9(dR) and siNP formulated nanoparticles in large size around 350&#x02013;600 nm within 1 hour at room temperature. Compared with the published results, the size is larger than the nanoparticles reported by the other researchers. At 15 and 60 minutes, average size of the particles increased from 350 to 650 nm. It indicated that T9(dR) and siRNA dissociated to some degree, but the mechanism is still under investigation. Nanoparticles comprising CPP and siRNA have to be attached to the cell membrane to intrude into cells. Usually, nanoparticle size is a key parameter for internalization pathways. In this study, TP or T9(dR) and siRNA complex may penetrate cellular membrane by caveolae-mediated internalization, which is the predominant entry route for 500-nm particles.<xref rid="b47-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Otherwise, internalization of nanoparticles of size &#x0003c;200 nm was observed to involve in clathrin-mediated endocytosis.<xref rid="b48-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Size of the nanoparticles also affect cytotoxicity upon internalization. Studies showed that smaller nanoparticles were highly toxic, caused rapid cell death, induced much higher levels of production of reactive oxygen species, and triggered NLRP3 inflammasome activation.<xref rid="b49-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> However, large nanoparticles (&#x0003e;600 nm) induced strong membrane deformation during the internalization.<xref rid="b50-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Therefore, selection of nanoparticles with appropriate size is crucial for their medical application.</p><p>siRNA against highly conserved gene segment of influenza virus had been demonstrated to provide protection against a broad array of influenza strains, including H1N1, H5N1, H7N7, and H9N2 isolates.<xref rid="b40-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="b51-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> In this study, T9(dR) was used to deliver siRNA against NP gene segment. Results in vitro showed that T9(dR) effectively transported siRNA into cytoplasm of MDCK, A549, RAW, and 293T cells. As for TP itself, it is an siRNA transporter with moderate efficiency, but attaching 9R to TP may increase siRNA uptake, allowed functional delivery of complexed siRNA, and conferred rapid siRNA translocation into the cytoplasm, but the mechanism is still under elucidation.<xref rid="b23-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> It is possible that attachment of 9R to TP enhances the binding ability and stabilizes the cargo. CPPs showed lower toxicity as an siRNA delivery tool compared with viral vectors, but results published by Freire et al suggest that CPPs themselves perturb cellular pathways.<xref rid="b52-dddt-13-1059" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Further investigation needs to be designed to test toxicity of T9(dR) both in vitro and in vivo to assure a safe siRNA delivery platform in medical application.</p><p>We treated mice with complexes formed by T9(dR) or TP and siNP before infection with PR8 H1N1 influenza virus. The results showed that siNP functioned well in vivo. It suggested that complexes formed by T9(dR) and siNP were resistant to digestion in serum; however, we did not know whether treatment before infection influence the initiation of infection by influenza viruses. When 10 nmol siNP gene was delivered into mouse lung by T9(dR) or TP, we observed partial protection. When 50 nmol siNP was delivered into mouse lung, delivery efficiency of T9(dR) was higher than that observed for TP. These results suggested that T9(dR) would be a promising functional siRNA delivery tool. In this study, only siRNA against the NP gene segment was employed. In future investigation, mixture of siRNA against the NP, M, and polymerase gene segments will be tested to improve the inhibition on influenza viruses. Perhaps, the cocktail siRNAs will enhance the protection against influenza viruses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we designed and synthesized a TP-derived CPP, T9(dR). Results of in vitro and in vivo trials showed T9(dR) delivered siRNA with higher efficiency as compared to delivery by TP. This study indicated that T9(dR) would prove to be a promising nucleotide delivery tool with potential application for nucleotide drug and vaccine.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by the Priority Academic Talent Team Cultivation Program of Shandong Colleges and Universities and Shandong National Science Foundation (ZR2017MC002).</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>All authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-dddt-13-1059"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>WW</given-names></name><name><surname>Shay</surname><given-names>DK</given-names></name><name><surname>Weintraub</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Mortality associated with influenza and respiratory syncytial virus in the United States</article-title><source>JAMA</source><year>2003</year><volume>289</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>179</fpage><lpage>186</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12517228</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-dddt-13-1059"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dushoff</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Plotkin</surname><given-names>JB</given-names></name><name><surname>Viboud</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Earn</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Simonsen</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Mortality due to influenza in the United States&#x02013;an annualized regression approach using multiple-cause mortality data</article-title><source>Am J Epidemiol</source><year>2006</year><volume>163</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>181</fpage><lpage>187</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1093/aje/kwj024</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16319291</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-dddt-13-1059"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fraser</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Donnelly</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name><name><surname>Cauchemez</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Pandemic potential of a strain of influenza A (H1N1): early findings</article-title><source>Science</source><year>2009</year><volume>324</volume><issue>5934</issue><fpage>1557</fpage><lpage>1561</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1126/science.1176062</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19433588</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4-dddt-13-1059"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dobrovolny</surname><given-names>HM</given-names></name><name><surname>Beauchemin</surname><given-names>CAA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Modelling the emergence of influenza drug resistance: the roles of surface proteins, the immune response and antiviral mechanisms</article-title><source>PLoS One</source><year>2017</year><volume>12</volume><issue>7</issue><fpage>e0180582</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0180582</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">28700622</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b5-dddt-13-1059"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nicholson</surname><given-names>KG</given-names></name><name><surname>Aoki</surname><given-names>FY</given-names></name><name><surname>Osterhaus</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Efficacy and safety of oseltamivir in treatment of acute influenza: a randomised controlled trial.
