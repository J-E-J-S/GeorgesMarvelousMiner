However, recent studies have shown that large fractions of genomic noncoding DNA are transcribed and translated, potentially generating new genes. Experimental validation of this process so far has been limited to comparative genomics, <italic>in vitro</italic> selections, or partial randomizations. Here, we describe selection of novel peptides <italic>in vivo</italic> using fully random synthetic expression libraries. The peptides confer aminoglycoside resistance by inserting into the bacterial membrane and thereby partly reducing membrane potential and decreasing drug uptake.

New genes can originate from different mechanisms, including horizontal gene transfer, duplication-divergence, and <italic>de novo</italic> from noncoding DNA sequences. Comparative genomics has generated strong evidence for <italic>de novo</italic> emergence of genes in various organisms, but experimental demonstration of this process has been limited to localized randomization in preexisting structural scaffolds. This bypasses the basic requirement of <italic>de novo</italic> gene emergence, i.e., lack of an ancestral gene. We constructed highly diverse plasmid libraries encoding randomly generated open reading frames and expressed them in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> to identify short peptides that could confer a beneficial and selectable phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic> (in a living cell). Selections on antibiotic-containing agar plates resulted in the identification of three peptides that increased aminoglycoside resistance up to 48-fold. Combining genetic and functional analyses, we show that the peptides are highly hydrophobic, and by inserting into the membrane, they reduce membrane potential, decrease aminoglycoside uptake, and thereby confer high-level resistance. This study demonstrates that randomized DNA sequences can encode peptides that confer selective benefits and illustrates how expression of random sequences could spark the origination of new genes. In addition, our results also show that this question can be addressed experimentally by expression of highly diverse sequence libraries and subsequent selection for specific functions, such as resistance to toxic compounds, the ability to rescue auxotrophic/temperature-sensitive mutants, and growth on normally nonused carbon sources, allowing the exploration of many different phenotypes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd><italic>Escherichia coli</italic></kwd><kwd>antibiotic resistance</kwd><kwd>aminoglycosides</kwd><kwd><italic>de novo</italic></kwd><kwd>gene evolution</kwd><kwd>membrane potential</kwd><kwd>peptides</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wallenberg Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015-0069</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andersson</surname><given-names>Dan I.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wallenberg Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013-0006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>&#x000c4;delroth</surname><given-names>Pia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Vetenskapsr&#x000e5;det (VR)</institution><institution-id>https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017-01527</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andersson</surname><given-names>Dan I.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><counts><count count="10" count-type="supplementary-material"/><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="71"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="12062"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>May/June 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Different mechanisms for the acquisition of new genes, such as horizontal gene transfer and duplication-divergence, have been observed in both natural systems and experimental settings (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, these mechanisms rely on preexisting genes as a substrate for evolution and do not explain how these preexisting genes arose <italic>de novo</italic> from noncoding DNA (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). For a protein-coding gene to arise <italic>de novo</italic>, a noncoding nucleotide sequence has to be transcribed and translated and confer a selectable beneficial function. The evolution of an entirely new gene without any functional progenitor has been regarded as an exceedingly rare and improbable event (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and considering that a random sequence generated by chance must encode a stable polypeptide with a function accessible by selection, this notion of impossibility might seem reasonable. However, comparative genomics in eukaryotes such as insects (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), yeast (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), Hydra (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), primates (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), mouse (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and plants (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) has provided strong evidence that this is possible and that parts of extant genomes contain genes without any recognized homologous sequences that nature had &#x0201c;tinkered&#x0201d; with.</p><p>In addition, it is becoming clear that large portions of the genomes of many organisms, including noncoding sequences, are highly transcribed (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), and that these transcripts can contain randomly occurring small open reading frames (sORFs) that are translated (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Historically, sORFs have been largely overlooked due to missing annotations and their incompatibility with many molecular biology detection tools. An increasing number of studies employing comparative genomics and ribosome profiling, however, show that sORFs are pervasive among all investigated organisms and can make up a large fraction of prokaryotic genomes (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Modern tools for gene prediction that incorporate ribosome profiling data estimate the presence of 125 sORFs encoding proteins of &#x02264;71 amino acids in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Another study based on sequence conservation and ribosome binding site models predicts 217 sORFs encoding peptides of less than 50 amino acids, most of which contain predicted transmembrane domains (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). This pervasive expression of small proteins potentially can serve as a pool for the <italic>de novo</italic> selection of functional peptides encoded by sORFs (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Furthermore, small proteins have been shown to carry out versatile functions, including attenuation of gene expression and regulation of transporters, stress response, and signal transduction (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The increasing recognition of sORFs as an abundant and functionally diverse class of genes that could originate from stochastic transcription and translation of noncoding sequences make them well suited for studying their <italic>de novo</italic> emergence by experimental evolution. In this study, we examined if short peptides encoded by randomized DNA sequences that were expressed from a plasmid in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> cells could confer selective benefits in the form of antibiotic resistance and by which mechanisms such new phenotypes could be generated.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Library construction and screening for <italic>de novo</italic> sORFs.</title><p>We constructed a set of highly diverse plasmid libraries containing randomly generated sORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>). The plasmid used is an in-house construct with a low-copy-number origin of replication (p15A). The synthetic sORFs are under the control of an inducible P<italic><sub>LlacO</sub></italic> promoter and encode peptides ranging from 10 to 50 amino acids. To avoid premature stop codons, we excluded adenine from the third codon position. This resulted in a 3.9-fold increase in full-length 50-mers compared to NNN (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;A, C, G, and T) repeats (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1A</xref> in the supplemental material) while still encoding all amino acids with only mildly changed frequencies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1B</xref>). Two libraries were designed with biased nucleotide compositions encoding either a higher fraction of primordial amino acids (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) (rnd_50b) or hydrophilic amino acids to increase intrinsic disorder and promote functional promiscuity (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) (rnd_50c) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1C</xref>).

However, it is noteworthy that these libraries only cover a marginal fraction of the complete possible diversity, which is approximately 9.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>33</sup> for a random 50-mer protein. All five libraries were transformed into <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> K-12 strain BW25113 (here designated <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>) and screened for ORFs that increase antibiotic resistance.

In total, 5.82&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>8</sup> cells, each expressing a unique sORF, were tested on 10 different antibiotics representing 9 antibiotic classes (kanamycin, trimethoprim, tetracycline, amikacin, fosfomycin, chloramphenicol, rifampin, cefaclor, nitrofurantoin, and ciprofloxacin) at three different concentrations, ranging from 2-fold to 16-fold of the respective MIC. Selection on plates was chosen over bulk selection in liquid culture to reduce the influence of selective sweeps and also allow the isolation of variants with low fitness.</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Selection of peptides from randomized sequence libraries that increase antibiotic resistance.

Two of these sORFs were also selected on amikacin plates. To ensure that the observed phenotypes were caused by expression of the sORFs rather than by unintended resistance mutations in the chromosome, we recloned all inserts into an empty plasmid and confirmed the phenotypes in the absence and presence of the inducer isopropyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Furthermore, we showed that the function was dependent on the encoded protein rather than the RNA transcript by demonstrating that variants without start codons or introduced frameshift mutations lost activity, and that inserts maintained activity when the identical amino acid sequence was recoded with a different nucleotide sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS3">Table&#x000a0;S3</xref>). To determine the resistance levels provided by Arp1 to Arp3 (Arp1-3) as well as their ability to confer cross-resistance to other antibiotics, we measured the MICs of 12 different antibiotics representing the major classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig.&#x000a0;S2</xref>). All peptides increased the MICs of the aminoglycosides kanamycin, amikacin, gentamicin, and streptomycin. Arp1 had the strongest effect, increasing amikacin resistance 48-fold compared to that of a strain with an empty control vector. The susceptibility to other antibiotic classes was not altered by overexpression of any of the peptides, demonstrating that the effect was specific to one antibiotic class. We also tested the dependence of the phenotype on the expression vector, copy number, P<italic><sub>LlacO</sub></italic> promoter, and host background. Overexpression of Arp1 caused a similar increase in resistance when expressed from a single chromosomal copy under the control of P<italic><sub>LlacO</sub></italic> or when placed under an arabinose-inducible promoter on a medium-copy-number plasmid (pBAD18 backbone [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]).

Arp1 causes the largest fraction of cells that tolerate 6 mg/liter kanamycin. (E and F) Using the arabinose-inducible expression system in pBAD18 further increases the fraction of the subpopulation with the highest resistance level. Values represent the means from 4 independent experiments. Numbers in brackets represent the standard deviations. We observed multiple zones of inhibition when performing MIC determinations using Etest strips with strains overexpressing Arp1-3. This was an indication of a heterogeneous population that prompted us to quantify the observed effect. Plating of an overnight culture on plates containing various amounts of kanamycin showed that after overexpression of Arp1 using pRD2, only 35% of the population was able to tolerate 6 mg/liter kanamycin. Subpopulations of various resistance levels were also observed after overexpression of Arp1 and Arp2. When overexpressed from pBAD18, Arp1 still induced the formation of subpopulations; however, the fraction of higher resistance cells increased to 50%. Thus, we decided to use this expression system for downstream experiments. Several causes could explain this effect: stochasticity could cause various expression levels of the peptide in different cells of the same population. Furthermore, the proposed resistance mechanism depends on insertion of the peptides into the membrane followed by a depolarization. The extent of membrane insertion could also randomly fluctuate among different cells. Lastly, it is likely that membrane potential itself shows some variation among different cells; thus, cells might be differentially affected by insertion of the same amount of peptide into the membrane. While the mechanistic basis of the formation of subpopulations is unclear, it limits our ability for phenotypic characterization. For example, the presence of populations with wild-type MIC, and therefore presumably a wild-type membrane potential, will reduce the signal we are able to measure for the membrane potential-responsive probe DiBAC<sub>4</sub>(3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3B</xref>) and the uptake of radiolabeled dihydrostreptomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3C</xref>).

Each residue was replaced with a positively charged (lysine), negatively charged (glutamic acid), &#x003b1;-helix breaker (proline), bulky (tryptophan), and hydrophilic (serine) amino acid. The 103 variants generated were then analyzed for their effect on the MIC of kanamycin to test which residues in Arp1 are required for the observed resistance phenotype and which residues can be varied. Changes to charged amino acids caused a complete loss of function in most cases, except for five variants with C-terminal substitutions that maintained kanamycin MICs of over 4&#x02009;mg/liter (compared to MICs of the empty vector control of 0.75&#x02009;mg/liter and Arp1 of 12&#x02009;mg/liter). Changes to proline resulted in 15 nonfunctional variants and 6 variants with a MIC of 2 to 3&#x02009;mg/liter kanamycin.

It is known that aminoglycoside uptake relies on the membrane potential and that resistance can be conferred by reducing the membrane potential (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), and conceivably these peptides could act in a similar way. To test this idea, we determined if overexpression of Arp1 causes a disruption of the electrochemical gradient by using the membrane potential-sensitive probe bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid)trimethine oxonol [DiBAC<sub>4</sub>(3)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3B</xref>). The protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazine (CCCP), which collapses the membrane potential, was used as a positive control. After CCCP treatment, a clear shift to higher fluorescence occurred due to an increased uptake of DiBAC<sub>4</sub>(3). This shift in fluorescence was also observed upon induction of Arp1 expression from the high-copy-number plasmid (pCA24N), showing that Arp1 insertion in the membrane causes a reduction of membrane potential. Additionally, we observed that expression of Arp1-3 results in the formation of subpopulations of cells with different resistance levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig.&#x000a0;S2</xref>), which might be due to cellular heterogeneity in expression and/or solubility of the peptides. The resulting difference in amounts of free peptides that can insert into the membrane could cause differences in membrane depolarization across the population and thereby generate cells with different resistance levels. This heterogeneity decreases the sensitivity of the conducted assays, since only a fraction of the population shows the investigated phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig.&#x000a0;S2</xref>). We also determined if the uptake of streptomycin was reduced when Arp1 is expressed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3C</xref>, levels of intracellular radiolabeled dihydrostreptomycin were significantly lower in a strain expressing the Arp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3C</xref>). The observed decrease in intracellular streptomycin is relatively small, although statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.008), but reduced streptomycin uptake and increased resistance does not necessarily correlate in a proportional way. Thus, a small effect on uptake can have a large effect on resistance, as has been observed previously (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p><p>To determine if overexpression of Arp1 in strains with elevated aminoglycoside resistance can cause an additional increase in resistance levels, we selected chromosomal mutants with the empty vector control strain on the same concentrations of kanamycin and amikacin that were used for selection of the <italic>de novo</italic> resistance genes. We isolated 24 mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig.&#x000a0;S3</xref>) and determined the resistance level to both antibiotics. Strikingly, all mutants exhibited approximately the same level of resistance as that observed for Arp1 overexpression. Furthermore, the selected mutants exhibited cross-resistance to both kanamycin and amikacin, indicating an identical mechanism of action. Whole-genome sequencing of six clones showed that all had mutations in genes associated with electron transport and generation of membrane potential (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS4">Table&#x000a0;S4</xref>). Overexpression of Arp1 in these mutants did not cause any further increase in kanamycin or amikacin resistance, indicating that the chromosomal mutations and peptides act by a similar mechanism (i.e., reduction in membrane potential) and that Arp1-dependent depolarization causes the highest resistance increase achievable by this mechanism. In contrast, overexpression of Arp1 in strains with mutations in the antibiotic target (<italic>rpsL</italic> K42N) or a target modification enzyme (<italic>gidB</italic> Q167*) elevated resistance levels beyond the level that was observed for mutants with disrupted membrane potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3D</xref>).</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="figS3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1128/mBio.00837-19.3</object-id><label>FIG&#x000a0;S3</label><p><bold>Selection of chromosomal mutants</bold>.

The results presented here are fully compatible with the depolarization model, but it should be pointed out that natural small proteins, such as MgtS (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), AcrZ (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), and others (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), have been shown to regulate membrane-located transporters, including efflux pumps such as AcrAB (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Thus, hypothetically Arp1-3 could confer increased resistance by upregulating an efflux pump. However, this explanation is unlikely, since the peptide-conferred resistance is completely specific for aminoglycosides, with no effect on more typical hydrophobic efflux pump substrates such as tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, and fluoroquinolones.</p><p>Alternatively, albeit unlikely, the increased resistance to aminoglycosides could be based on a physiological response to high expression of foreign peptides. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3A</xref>, production of Arp1 causes the formation of inclusion bodies. This will likely result in a disruption of the normal cell physiology and cause the activation of stress responses (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). For example, the heat shock response induces upregulation of various chaperones and proteases that could themselves influence the formation of membrane potential. However, to our knowledge, no stress response exists in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> that results specifically in aminoglycoside resistance. Furthermore, if the effect was due to formation of inclusion bodies and generation of a stress response, one would expect that overexpression of many peptides would generate resistance (which we do not observe), since overexpression is often associated with formation of inclusion bodies. Finally, if the resistance was due to the reduced growth rate associated with peptide production, one would expect that unrelated mutations that reduce growth rate should induce aminoglycoside resistance as well. However, analysis of aminoglycoside resistance in several unrelated mutants with reduced growth rate had no effect on aminoglycoside resistance (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In summary, it seems very unlikely that the aminoglycoside resistance is caused by an indirect physiological effect.</p><p>To further examine if the loss of membrane potential is a direct effect of peptide insertion into the membrane, we used a purified <italic>in vitro</italic> system to measure the effect of synthesized Arp1 peptide and a nonfunctional (i.e., confers no resistance when expressed <italic>in vivo</italic>) control variant (Arp1-L11K) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2D</xref>) on the activity of the proton pump bovine cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (Cyt<italic>c</italic>O) reconstituted into proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4A</xref>; also see schematic in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig.&#x000a0;S4</xref>). When the enzyme is active, it reduces oxygen to water, using protons from inside the vesicles; in addition, protons are pumped across the membrane. A proton electrochemical gradient thereby is rapidly built up across the liposome membrane, slowing down further activity, and the resulting slow steady-state rate is called the coupled rate. When ionophores (valinomycin, a K<sup>+</sup> ionophore, and/or FCCP, a protonophore similar to CCCP) are added, this gradient is partly or fully dissipated, and the so-called uncoupled rate is reached. Respiratory control ratios, dividing the uncoupled and the coupled rates (RCR; see reference <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), are a measure of the degree to which additives can uncouple the built-up potential and generally gives a value of 3 to 5 for full uncoupling by FCCP in our experimental system (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig.&#x000a0;S4</xref> for a schematic of the experiment and an example of a raw data trace). Thus, we determined the RCRs after adding the Arp-1 and Arp1-L11K peptides, and as positive controls we added valinomycin and FCCP in addition to the peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig.&#x000a0;S4C</xref>). Increasing amounts of Arp1 had mild uncoupling effects (i.e., stimulated the activity of Cyt<italic>c</italic>O), with RCRs increasing up to around 1.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">B</xref>). Valinomycin addition led to further rate increase, and FCCP fully collapsed the gradient, giving the maximum Cyt<italic>c</italic>O activity. The L11K variant of the peptide did not show any uncoupling effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig.&#x000a0;S4C</xref>), even at high concentrations. The maximal RCR after FCCP addition decreased at higher peptide concentrations, indicating that it affects the Cyt<italic>c</italic>O negatively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig.&#x000a0;S4C</xref>). We further investigated if the peptides indeed affect the enzyme activity <italic>per se</italic> by measuring their effect on the Cyt<italic>c</italic>O activity in detergent. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4C</xref>, both peptides had small negative effects on the Cyt<italic>c</italic>O activity in detergent. Thus, the activity increase observed in the Cyt<italic>c</italic>O liposomes when the Arp1 peptide is added is most likely due to an uncoupling effect, as the direct effect of peptide itself on the oxidase is negative. In summary, these results show that Arp1 is capable of partly uncoupling a proton electrochemical gradient, and that the likely cause for this uncoupling is an increase in the permeability to protons. That the peptide does not completely dissipate the gradient is important, since full dissipation would stop bacterial growth.</p><fig id="fig4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p><italic>In vitro</italic> studies with synthesized Arp1 and Arp1-L11K peptides.

Theoretically, any peptide or domain that spans the membrane creates a lesion in the phospholipid bilayer that could cause leakage of protons or ions. However, the site-directed mutagenesis of Arp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2D</xref>) showed that the function is sequence specific. Not only did most changes to charged amino acids or prolines cause a complete loss of function but also substitutions with a weak hydrophilic residue (serine) or even another hydrophobic amino acid (tryptophan) were detrimental in almost all variants. Additionally, four variants (C6K, F7K, I8K, and I12W) were toxic when expressed. While we do not know the cause of the cytotoxicity, it is possible that the substitutions cause a lethal disruption of membrane integrity. This shows that not only functionality but also viability is quickly lost upon changes of the specific sequences that were isolated.</p><p>Furthermore, the alignment of Arp1-3 suggests that, besides the requirement of a strong hydrophobicity followed by a hydrophilic C terminus, certain positions are conserved. For example, Arp1-3 all contained a phenylalanine at position 4, which indicates a functional role of this residue possibly promoting dimerization (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). To further elucidate the sequence requirements and conservation, more variants of this peptide class need to be isolated to generate a higher statistical power which allows a more detailed analysis. To further show that the phenotype is specific to Arp1-3, we overexpressed three endogenous <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> peptides, TisB, IbsC, and LdrD, that are similar to Arp1-3 in regard to size and hydrophobicity. The 29-mer toxin TisB, which is encoded by the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> K-12 genome, is part of a toxin-antitoxin system, and it inhibits growth when overexpressed. It has been shown to form channels that allow ion leakage and cause membrane depolarization (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). However, TisB expression from a pBAD promoter (arabinose concentrations ranging between 0.0125 and 0.2%) conferred no increased resistance when expressed at viable levels (high expression levels of TisB were lethal). Similarly, no increased resistance could be observed when overexpressing the toxins IbsC and LdrD. We further tested if overexpression of other transmembrane domains that are not part of toxin-antitoxin systems could cause aminoglycoside resistance. For this, we chose 10 representative transmembrane domains from 5 genes with different physiological functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS5">Table&#x000a0;S5</xref>) and overexpressed them from the pBAD18 vector. None of the variants increased resistance to kanamycin or amikacin. These results show that Arp1-3 are facilitating a unique function in causing depolarization to an extent that generates antibiotic resistance but still maintains cell viability.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="tabS5"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1128/mBio.00837-19.10</object-id><label>TABLE&#x000a0;S5</label><p>List of transmembrane helices tested for increased aminoglycoside resistance.

However, under certain conditions, mutants with a defective electron transport chain have a strong selective advantage. For example, small-colony variants (SCVs), which often result from mutations in genes associated with electron transport, have been isolated from various infections and species (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Additionally, SCVs can be rapidly selected <italic>in vitro</italic>, for example, under antibiotic pressure (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), cold stress (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), hydrostatic pressure (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), or low pH (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). The reduced membrane potential and low growth rate of electron transport-defective SCVs offer various advantages to the bacterial cell. First, the uptake of toxic compounds that rely on an active membrane potential, like aminoglycoside antibiotics, is reduced and the cell will be able to persist and/or proliferate. Additionally, the reduced growth rate and, thus, reduced speed of cell division will dampen the cytostatic effect of &#x003b2;-lactam antibiotics (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Besides the selective advantage in the presence of antibiotics, SCVs can have an increased survival rate <italic>in vivo</italic>. These mutants are often attenuated, for example, by a decreased expression of immunogens, which causes a reduction in immune response and therefore a higher survival rate inside the host (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Other clinically important resistance mechanisms, in particular target alterations/modifications, are typically associated with a reduction in bacterial fitness in the absence of antibiotics (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). For example, mutations in <italic>rpsL</italic>, which confer high-level streptomycin resistance, can cause a reduction in fitness of up to 26% (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Similarly, expression of the 16S rRNA methyltransferase ArmA or mutations in the 16S rRNA, both increasing aminoglycoside resistance, are associated with a significant reduction in fitness (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>).</p><p>Compared to the fitness costs discussed above, expression of Arp1 in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> causes a similar reduction in fitness, and during exponential growth in nutrient-rich growth medium fitness is reduced by 36%. Under these conditions, clones expressing this peptide would be rapidly outcompeted, and fixation of the new function would be unlikely. However, in the presence of aminoglycoside antibiotics it confers a strong fitness advantage, allowing cell proliferation at concentrations which inhibit growth of the wild type. Thus, expression of these peptides offers, similar to SCVs, a conditional benefit to the bacterial cell. Interestingly, membrane depolarization via peptides has a distinct advantage over electron transport-defective mutants, in that expression and, therefore, the phenotype could evolve to become inducible, for example, by evolution of a regulated promoter or a regulatory small RNA. It is possible that endogenous, tightly regulated toxic peptides like TisB have evolved in this manner to induce growth arrest in environments where an active metabolism and cell division are detrimental (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Furthermore, similar to what has been observed for costly antibiotic resistance mutations, compensatory evolution could reduce the deleterious fitness effects and increase the chance of fixation.</p><p>Various studies have identified potential <italic>de novo</italic> genes in all domains of life based on comparative genomics (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>), and experimental studies have shown that new functions can be selected by randomization of amino acid stretches located in preexisting structural scaffolds (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). Recently, even variants with enzymatic functions could be isolated from a four-helix-bundle template (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). These studies demonstrate persuasively that new functions can arise from localized randomization, but they do not sufficiently address the functionality encoded in completely random sequence pools that do not rely on preexisting scaffold. Another study using unbiased sequence libraries to select ATP binding activity <italic>in vitro</italic> enriched four out of 6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>12</sup> proteins with the selected activity (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). However, this experimental setup does not incorporate mRNA and protein stability <italic>in vivo</italic> (i.e., in a living bacterial cell) or that a beneficial function was conferred to the host. Similarly, a study utilizing biased expression libraries composed of glutamine, asparagine, and arginine residues <italic>in vivo</italic> showed that a large fraction is stably expressed, forms &#x003b1;-helices, and is protected from proteolytic degradation (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>), but these studies did not reveal any beneficial selectable function for the bacterial cell. Here, we present experimental selection for peptides that confer a beneficial functionality <italic>in vivo</italic> and that were generated from randomized nucleotide sequences, supporting the idea that expression of randomly occurring sORFs can serve as a substrate for evolution of <italic>de novo</italic> genes. Further work is needed to determine what fraction of sequence space can generate such beneficial functions and which factors constrain how rapidly a proto-peptide/protein can be fine-tuned in its cellular function and how the initial fitness costs can be reduced. It would be interesting to examine if a cell can evolve to reduce the deleterious side effects of Arp expression. Evolution of such variants would likely require multiple genetic alterations which could be achieved with large bacterial populations during long-term evolution experiments in laboratory settings.</p><p>Finally, an interesting question is whether Arp-like proteins could provide aminoglycoside resistance in real-life clinical isolates. To our knowledge no one has searched for such functions, but we find it unlikely that they would be significant contributors, because there are other mechanisms that are easier to acquire and less deleterious to the cell. However, it is interesting to speculate that if Arps were present on plasmids and acquired regulatory elements, this could allow horizontal transfer and a conditionally inducible temporary reduction of membrane potential and associated resistance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s3.1"><title>Strains and growth conditions.</title><p>Most strains used in this study were derived from <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> K-12 BW25113 (designated <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> throughout the text) and are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table&#x000a0;S1</xref> in the supplemental material.

The counts of the CCCP control were subtracted from those of the other samples to correct for uptake in cells with a completely collapsed membrane potential and binding of dihydrostreptomycin to the cell surface.</p></sec><sec id="s3.13"><title>Selection of chromosomal mutants.</title><p>Four independent cultures of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> BW25113 carrying the empty pRD2 control vector were grown overnight in MHB with 100&#x02009;mg/liter ampicillin and plated on MHA with 100&#x02009;mg/liter ampicillin, 1&#x02009;mM IPTG, and either 6&#x02009;mg/liter kanamycin or amikacin. Plates were incubated overnight, and resistant mutants were purified on plates containing the same amount of antibiotic. Overnight cultures were grown in MHB with 100&#x02009;mg/liter ampicillin and cryopreserved in 10% DMSO. To test the additivity of the chromosomal mutants with overexpression of Arp1, the empty control plasmid was cured. For this, cultures were grown overnight in MHB without ampicillin and plated on no-salt LA plates containing 5% sucrose for counterselection of <italic>sacB</italic>.

Finally, the DNA was resuspended in water and diluted to a final concentration of 0.2&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/liter. Illumina&#x02019;s Nextera XT kit was used to generate libraries (2&#x000d7;&#x02009;300) to be sequenced with MiSeq per the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. All samples were dual-indexed and pooled. Average whole-genome coverage per sample was approximately 40-fold. Analysis of the fastq files obtained from MiSeq sequencing was performed using CLC Genomics Workbench. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling and structural variants were assessed using standard parameters.

Large liposomes were formed by rapidly freezing the lipid solution for 1 min in liquid nitrogen, followed by thawing on a 30&#x000b0;C heat block with 30&#x02009;s of vortexing between treatments. This procedure was repeated 5 times, and the liposomes were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were formed by extruding the liposomes with a miniextruder through 100-nm Whatman extruder membranes.
