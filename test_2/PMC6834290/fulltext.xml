In model organisms, such as budding yeast, systematic gene deletion studies have revealed that paralog genes are less likely to be essential than singleton genes and that this can partially be attributed to the ability of paralogs to buffer each other's loss. However, the essentiality of a gene is not a fixed property and can vary significantly across different genetic backgrounds. It is unclear to what extent paralogs contribute to this variation, as most studies have analyzed genes identified as essential in a single genetic background. Here, using gene essentiality profiles of 558 genetically heterogeneous tumor cell lines, we analyze the contribution of paralogy to variable essentiality. We find that, compared to singleton genes, paralogs are less frequently essential and that this is more evident when considering genes with multiple paralogs or with highly sequence-similar paralogs. In addition, we find that paralogs derived from whole genome duplication exhibit more variable essentiality than those derived from small-scale duplications. We provide evidence that in 13&#x02013;17% of cases the variable essentiality of paralogs can be attributed to buffering relationships between paralog pairs, as evidenced by synthetic lethality. Paralog pairs derived from whole genome duplication and pairs that function in protein complexes are significantly more likely to display such synthetic lethal relationships. Overall we find that many of the observations made using a single strain of budding yeast can be extended to understand patterns of essentiality in genetically heterogeneous cancer cell lines.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Somewhat surprisingly, the majority of human genes can be mutated or deleted in individual cell lines without killing the cells. This observation raises a number of questions&#x02014;which genes can be lost and why? Here we address these questions by analyzing data on which genes are essential for the growth of over 500 cancer cell lines. In general we find that paralog genes are essential in fewer cell lines than genes that are not paralogs. Paralogs are genes that have been duplicated at some point in evolutionary history, resulting in our genome having two copies of the same gene&#x02014;a paralog pair. These paralog pairs are a potential source of redundancy, similar to a car having a spare tire. If this is the case, one might expect that losing one gene from a paralog pair could be tolerated by cells, due to the existence of a 'backup gene', but losing both members would cause cells to die. By analyzing the cancer cell lines we estimate this to be the case for 13&#x02013;17% of paralog pairs, and that this provides an explanation for why some genes are essential in some cell lines but not others.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002081</institution-id><institution>Irish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Laureate Awards 2017/2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2750-9854</contrib-id><name><surname>Ryan</surname><given-names>Colm J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded through an Irish Research Council (research.ie) 2017/2018 Laureate Award awarded to C.J.R.

Essentiality has been used as a model to understand general features of the mapping from genotype to phenotype and also to understand genetic robustness, the ability of organisms to tolerate genetic perturbations. The majority of studies of essentiality have analyzed comprehensive maps of essential genes derived from systematic genetic perturbation studies in laboratory strains of model organisms, most notably the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae y</italic>east gene deletion collection [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These analyses have revealed biological features that influence essentiality, for instance genes that encode protein complex subunits are more likely to be essential [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] while duplicate genes (paralogs) are less likely to be essential [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A limitation of these studies, imposed by a lack of data, is that essentiality is treated as a fixed binary property. However, it has become increasingly apparent that gene essentiality is influenced by genetic background effects and can be highly variable even within species [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For instance, analysis of gene deletion collections in two very closely related strains of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> revealed that ~6% of genes are &#x02018;conditionally essential&#x02019;, i.e. essential in only one background [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. While such studies have revealed that essentiality is influenced by genetic background, the small number of strains analyzed have precluded a large-scale analysis of factors that contribute to the variation in essentiality.</p><p>Recent technical advances, such as the development of CRISPR-Cas9 based approaches for genome-wide screening, have made it possible to identify essential genes in large panels of cancer cell lines [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These resources make it possible, for the first time, to systematically investigate the factors that contribute to variation in essentiality. In this work we perform such a systematic analysis, focusing on the contribution of duplicate genes (paralogs) to variation in essentiality.</p><p>Gene duplication is the primary mechanism by which new genes are created. Initially gene duplication results in two genes that have identical coding sequences and typically identical gene regulatory regions. Over evolutionary time scales the two paralogs may diverge in functionality, but they frequently maintain at least some degree of functional overlap that can provide buffering capacity [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The relationship between gene duplication and essentiality has been well established in budding yeast and replicated in additional model organisms. Initial analysis of the yeast gene deletion collection suggested that singleton genes, i.e. those with no identifiable paralog, were more than twice as likely as paralogs to be essential [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Similar observations have been made using RNA interference in the worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], in systematic knockout studies in mice [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and using genetic screens of individual cancer cell lines [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This suggests that paralogs contribute significantly to the ability of cells and organisms to tolerate genetic perturbations, typically termed genetic robustness [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The simplest explanation for the increased tolerance of paralog loss is that the functional redundancy shared by paralogs allows them to buffer each other&#x02019;s loss. Direct evidence supporting this model comes from double perturbation screens that compare the fitness consequences of perturbing two genes simultaneously to the expected consequences based on perturbing each gene individually. The majority of these screens have been performed in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, where it has been shown that about 25&#x02013;35% of paralog pairs are &#x02018;synthetic lethal&#x02019;, i.e. the simultaneous disruption of both paralogs in the pair is lethal, while the individual genes can be deleted without a significant effect on fitness [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In contrast, fewer than 5% of randomly selected gene pairs are synthetic lethal, suggesting that paralog pairs are significantly more likely to buffer each other&#x02019;s loss than random gene pairs. Subsequent analyses have clarified that various features of paralog pairs, such as their sequence similarity and mode of duplication, can influence their essentiality and propensity to buffer each other&#x02019;s loss [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Overall the evidence supports a model whereby paralog genes are less likely to be essential than singleton genes because the loss of one member of a paralog pair can be compensated for by the other member. However, as these analyses have been performed in a fixed genetic background there is little understanding of how genetic variation may contribute to paralog essentiality.</p><p>Here we use the results of genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screens of 558 genetically heterogeneous cancer cell lines [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] to address this question. We find that paralogs are less likely to be broadly essential than singleton genes and more likely to be never essential in any of the cell lines assayed. The frequency of essentiality of a given paralog can be associated with the number of paralogs it has, their sequence similarity and its mode of duplication (whole-genome vs. small-scale duplication). We estimate that in 13&#x02013;17% of cases where a paralog is essential in some cell lines but not others, this variation in essentiality can be attributed to a synthetic lethal relationship with a variably expressed paralog. We find that paralogs that display such synthetic lethal relationships are enriched among whole-genome duplicates and protein complex members, and that both of these factors are independently predictive of synthetic lethality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Essentiality and paralogy for 16,540 human genes</title><p>To understand the variable essentiality of each gene we first obtained the results of genome-wide pooled CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens performed in 558 genetically heterogeneous cancer cell lines [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec016">Methods</xref>). These screens were performed using the Avana single guide RNA (sgRNA) library which contains sgRNAs targeting 17,634 genes with approximately 4 sgRNAs per gene. The fitness consequences of disrupting a specific gene are estimated by comparing the abundances of guides targeting the gene at the start of the experiment to the abundances of the same guides after 21 days of growth. A relative decrease in abundance of guides from the beginning to the end of the experiment suggests that disruption of the target gene causes a fitness defect. The magnitude of the impact on fitness can be inferred from the magnitude of change in abundance. By design, each sgRNA should target only a single gene, but recent work has shown that this and other libraries contain 'multi-targeting' sgRNAs that can match multiple sites in the genome and consequently disrupt the function of multiple genes [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This means that any fitness measurements made using these &#x02018;multi-targeting&#x02019; sgRNAs may reflect genetic interactions resulting from inhibiting multiple genes simultaneously. Previous work has found that such multi-targeting sgRNAs disproportionately target paralog genes [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] potentially confounding any naive comparison of the fitness effects of disrupting paralogs and singletons. To avoid such confounding we reprocessed the screens to remove multi-targeting sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008466.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen.1008466.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1008466.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Obtaining essentiality data for 16,540 protein-coding genes in 558 cancer cell lines.</title><p>(A) Workflow showing how gene scores were pre-processed and subsequently binarized.

We obtained a set of paralog relationships from ENSEMBL [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec016">Methods</xref>) and as expected found that paralogs are more likely than singleton genes to be targeted by at least one multi-targeting sgRNA (Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.7, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;2x10<sup>-16</sup>, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test). Genes that share high sequence identity with their closest paralog were particularly vulnerable to multi-targeting; ~86% of the genes that share 90% or more sequence identity with their closest paralog are targeted by at least one multi-target sgRNA in the Avana library, compared to ~15% of genes overall (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008466.s006">S1A Fig</xref>).</p><p>We then dropped sgRNAs that target more than one gene before reprocessing all of the CRISPR screens with CERES (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec016">Methods</xref>) which corrects for the known artefacts in CRISPR screens introduced by copy number variation [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. CERES integrates data from all sgRNAs targeting a given gene to calculate a single fitness score per gene. However, after dropping the multi-targeting sgRNAs from the dataset, a number of genes were targeted with fewer than 3 sgRNAs. We excluded these genes from further analysis, resulting in a dataset containing fitness scores for 16,638 genes. As might be expected given their susceptibility to multi-targeting, genes with at least one highly sequence-similar paralog were disproportionately filtered out: ~67% of the genes that share 90% sequence identity or more with their closest paralog were dropped, while overall only ~8% of paralogs were dropped (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008466.s006">S1B Fig</xref>).

In addition, of the pairs where both paralogs are members of the same protein complex, ~26.2% are putative synthetic lethal, compared to ~12.1% of pairs where this is not the case (OR = 2.6, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;1x10<sup>-4</sup>, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test).</p><p>A notable difference between whole genome and small-scale duplications is that the former preserves the relative gene dosage balance while the latter does not. The dosage-balance hypothesis predicts that changes in relative dosage are most likely to be deleterious for genes whose products interact in a stoichiometric fashion, such as in a protein complex [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Consequently small-scale duplications of protein complex subunits, which disrupt protein complex stoichiometry, will not be well tolerated while whole genome duplications, which duplicate entire complexes and maintain stoichiometry, will be better tolerated [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Over time this will result in a relative increase in the number of WGDs in protein complexes compared to SSDs. Indeed, in the full set of paralog pairs, we found that genes which form part of a WGD pair are significantly more likely to be protein complex members than genes in SSD pairs (OR = 2.3, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;2x10<sup>-16</sup>, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008466.s007">S2A Fig</xref>), as well as significantly more likely to be members of the same protein complex (OR = 5, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;2x10<sup>-16</sup>, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test), which is in agreement with previous observations in yeast [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>This suggests that one reason protein complex subunits are more likely to be involved in a putative synthetic lethal interaction is that they are enriched in WGD pairs and vice versa. To test whether the two factors were independent we first asked whether protein complex membership is still predictive of synthetic lethality when only considering WGDs. We found that WGD protein complex members are more likely to be potentially synthetic lethal than WGDs which are not protein complex members, both when considering either gene being a complex member (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008466.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, OR = 2.1, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;1x10<sup>-5</sup>, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test) or both genes being members of the same complex (OR = 1.9, <italic>p</italic> = 0.015, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test). We next asked whether, among the paralog pairs involving protein complex subunits, WGDs were enriched in putative synthetic lethals compared to SSDs. We found this to be the case: ~22.4% of WGDs in this subset are putative synthetic lethal compared to ~12.7% of SSDs in this subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008466.g006">Fig 6D</xref>, OR = 2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test). This suggests that both the mode of duplication and protein complex membership are independently predictive of whether a paralog pair will exhibit evidence of a buffering relationship.</p><p>The above approach to identify putative synthetic lethal interactions was performed using only the most sequence-similar paralog for each gene. However, these paralog pairs still encompass a range of different sequence similarities. In yeast it has been shown that buffering paralog pairs share higher sequence similarity than non-buffering paralog pairs [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. To test whether that is also the case among paralog pairs in cancer cell lines, we compared the sequence identities of the 238 putative synthetic lethal pairs to the sequence identities of the other sometimes essential pairs that we tested. We found that indeed, the sequence identity shared by putative synthetic lethal pairs is on average higher than that shared by non-synthetic-lethal pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008466.g006">Fig 6E</xref>, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;1x10<sup>-16</sup>, <italic>t</italic>-test). The same observation can be made for different subsets of the tested pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008466.g006">Fig 6E</xref>), i.e. when only considering WGDs (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;1x10<sup>-9</sup>, <italic>t</italic>-test), SSDs (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;1x10<sup>-5</sup>, <italic>t</italic>-test) or pairs for which either gene is a protein complex member (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;1x10<sup>-9</sup>, <italic>t</italic>-test). This indicates that more sequence-similar paralog pairs are better able to buffer each other&#x02019;s loss, potentially due to their greater functional overlap, and that sequence similarity is another factor that is independently predictive of synthetic lethality.</p><p>A given gene may have multiple paralogs and any one of these paralogs may be able to buffer the gene&#x02019;s loss. It is not necessarily the case that the most sequence-similar paralog will be responsible for this buffering relationship and consequently we may miss additional buffering relationships by looking solely at the most sequence-similar pairs. We therefore repeated our analysis of differential paralog expression using all paralog pairs where A1 is sometimes essential, and A2 has associated expression data. There are 6,221 such pairs, comprising 1,819 unique A1 genes. At a 10% FDR we found that for 374 of these pairs the expression of A2 is significantly lower in the cell lines where A1 is essential compared to those where A1 is not essential (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008466.s007">S2B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008466.s005">S5 Table</xref>); 211 of the 374 pairs consist of the most sequence-similar paralog for the given A1. In some cases the essentiality of a given A1 gene can be associated with reduced expression of multiple of its A2 paralogs. The 374 putative synthetic lethal pairs identified in this analysis comprise 301 unique A1s, or ~16.5% of the tested sometimes essential paralogs, that have their essentiality associated with lower expression of one or more of their paralogs. We again asked how often this putative synthetic lethal effect was likely driven by copy number variation or genetic mutation. For 110 of the 374 putative synthetic lethal pairs the copy number of A2 is significantly lower in the cell lines where A1 is essential compared to the cell lines where A1 is not essential (t-test, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, FDR&#x0003c;10%). Analyzing nonsense mutations we found only the same three pairs as in the previous analysis (<italic>ARID1A/ARID1B</italic>, <italic>SMARCA2/SMARCA4</italic>, <italic>STAG1/STAG2</italic>) (Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, p&#x0003c;0.05, FDR&#x0003c;10%).</p><p>As with the analysis restricted to the most sequence-similar paralogs only, we found that the putative synthetic lethal pairs in this set of expanded paralog pairs are enriched for WGDs compared to SSDs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008466.s007">S2C Fig</xref>, OR = 3, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;2x10<sup>-16</sup>, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test), and for protein complex membership (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008466.s007">S2D Fig</xref>, OR = 2.2, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;1x10<sup>-13</sup>, for either gene being a complex member, and OR = 4, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;1x10<sup>-10</sup> for both genes being members of the same complex, Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests). Overall our analyses suggest that 13&#x02013;17% of the paralogs that are sometimes essential may have the variation in their essentiality associated with variable expression of their paralogs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec010"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we have shown that paralogs are less frequently essential in cancer cell lines than singletons across a wide range of genetic backgrounds and that the frequency of a paralog&#x02019;s essentiality is influenced by its number of paralogs, their sequence similarity and their mode of duplication. In addition, we have shown that, for 13&#x02013;17% of the paralogs that are variably essential in cancer cell lines, this variation can be attributed to paralog buffering. Specifically, the cell lines in which these genes are essential correspond to the cell lines in which at least one of their paralogs exhibits significantly lower expression, indicative of a synthetic lethal relationship. We found that these putative synthetic lethal relationships are more frequent among paralogs pairs that stem from whole-genome duplication as well as among paralog pairs that encode protein complex subunits.</p><sec id="sec011"><title>Limitations of CRISPR screens for estimating paralog essentiality in cancer cell lines</title><p>The definition of context-specific essentiality requires a reasonable estimation of which genes are and aren&#x02019;t essential in each context. In yeast, essentiality has been determined empirically based on the viability of strains with defined gene knockouts [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A similar resource is not available for human cells. In this work we applied a threshold to quantitative fitness scores derived from genome-wide pooled CRISPR screens in cancer cell lines in order to call each gene in each cell line either essential or non-essential. We note that genes identified as non-essential in our analysis may be essential under some other environmental conditions and this may only become evident as screens are performed in multiple conditions. The score threshold chosen was based on a data-driven analysis of the fitness score distribution across all cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008466.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). However, as this threshold could potentially influence the downstream results, we also analyzed the data after binarizing the fitness scores with two additional thresholds: -0.4 and -0.6. Compared to the original threshold, these thresholds result in a larger and smaller set of sometimes essential genes, respectively, but all of the general trends that we observed regarding the relationship between essentiality and gene duplication hold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008466.s008">S3 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008466.s009">S4 Fig</xref> for thresholds -0.4 and -0.6 respectively).</p><p>There are additional limitations to the use of extant CRISPR screens for analyzing the essentiality of genes, especially those with a highly sequence similar paralog. Most of the genes that were filtered out as a result of discarding multi-targeting sgRNAs are highly sequence-similar paralogs, primarily those with &#x0003e;90% sequence identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008466.s006">S1B Fig</xref>). Our findings suggest that these genes are less likely to be broadly essential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008466.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) and more likely to exhibit a synthetic lethal relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008466.g006">Fig 6E</xref>) than paralogs with lower sequence identity. Excluding these genes may have had some influence on the results presented in this paper, but they represent a minority of all paralogs targeted (~4%), and consequently this influence is likely to be minor. To accurately assess the fitness consequences of these highly-sequence similar genes would require careful redesign of sgRNA libraries to avoid multi-targeting effects.</p><p>A further issue that could confound the estimates of cell line specific fitness effects is that cell line specific mutations could impact the efficacy of individual sgRNAs&#x02014;e.g. single nucleotide variants may disrupt the match between the sgRNA protospacer and DNA sequence&#x02014;or introduce additional multi-targeting effects [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The sgRNAs used in the screens analyzed were designed using the human reference genome and consequently may be subject to such effects in the genetically variable set of cell lines under consideration. We expect that requiring a minimum of three different sgRNAs per gene should reduce the impact of genetic variation that alters the efficacy of individual guides or introduces off-target effects due to cell-line specific mutations. However, we cannot rule out that some of the observed context-dependent essentiality was influenced by bias in the sgRNA fitness scores resulting from cell-line specific mutations.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Context-dependent essentiality and gene duplication</title><p>We find that, in cancer cell lines, context-specific essentiality is much more common than context-independent essentiality. In yeast it has been well established that different genes are essential in different environmental conditions [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], but there is also a growing recognition that gene essentiality is dependent on genetic background [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Understanding this dynamic view of essentiality can only be achieved using large-scale, genome-wide screens in multiple genetic contexts. In budding yeast and in the worm <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> such screens are starting to appear, but have been limited to only a couple of strains [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Here we have performed an analysis of 558 genetically heterogeneous cancer cell lines, allowing us to obtain a more comprehensive view of the variation in gene essentiality.</p><p>Analysis of the yeast knockout collection in a single genetic background previously suggested that WGDs were less likely to be essential than SSDs [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Here we expand this view to show that WGDs are less likely to be broadly essential than SSDs. However we also found that WGDs are less likely to be never essential than SSDs. This suggests that WGDs are more likely to be essential in a context-specific fashion than SSDs, an observation that can only be made using data from multiple genetic backgrounds. This increased context-specific essentiality of WGDs can be partially explained by the increased tendency of WGDs to display synthetic lethality&#x02014;many WGDs appear to only be essential when the expression of their paralog is reduced. As cancer cell lines exhibit extensive genetic and epigenetic variability, the resulting variation in expression combined with the buffering relationships between paralogs appears to contribute to the variable essentiality of WGDs.</p><p>We estimate that at least 13&#x02013;17% of cases of context-dependent essentiality among paralogs can be attributed to expression variation of a paralogous gene. We detected this by exploiting the transcriptomic variation in the cell line panel. There are likely additional buffering pairs that we did not detect because the genes were under-expressed in too few of the cell lines analyzed or because reduced expression (rather than no expression) is insufficient to reveal the synthetic lethal relationship. We note that genetic variation of the coding region of the paralogous gene, via copy number variation or nonsense mutation, is only observed in a minority of the putative synthetic lethal pairs (~36%). In the majority of cases the altered mRNA expression must be due to non-coding variation, epigenetic variation or more distal trans effects and remains to be explained.</p><p>There are a number of additional explanations for the ~85% of paralogs whose variable essentiality cannot be associated with expression variation of an individual paralog. In addition to buffering relationships between paralog pairs there are likely to be higher-order buffering relationships between multiple paralogs that form part of a paralog family. Such relationships might only be revealed when three or more paralogs are perturbed simultaneously. In budding yeast these higher-order interactions have been mapped systematically [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] but their contribution to the fitness of cancer cells remains unknown and we cannot easily detect them here. Furthermore, some of the sometimes essential paralogs may engage in synthetic lethal interactions with non-paralogous genes, i.e. genes with which they share no homology [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We do not have the statistical power to detect such relationships in an unbiased fashion, as it would require comparing the variable essentiality of each paralog with the expression levels of all ~20,000 protein coding genes. Finally, it is likely that some of the variable essentiality of individual genes can be attributed to genetic variation that alters the gene itself rather than its paralogs. Such self-vs-self associations include oncogene addiction effects, where mutation or amplification of a gene in a tumor cell is associated with increased dependency upon that gene for cellular fitness, and &#x02018;CYCLOPS&#x02019; effects, where single copy (heterozygous) gene loss results in increased sensitivity of cancer cells to further perturbation of the gene itself [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Prioritizing paralog pairs most likely to exhibit synthetic lethal interactions</title><p>Synthetic lethality represents a promising approach for the development of targeted therapies in cancer, in particular synthetic lethal relationships involving genes that are recurrently mutated or deleted in cancer [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].

Looking across a collection of genetically heterogeneous cancer cell lines we can extend these observations to an essentiality spectrum; e.g. we could extend the observation about essentiality to: paralogs are less frequently essential than singletons, i.e. essential in fewer genetic contexts. Similarly, we could extend the observation that WGDs are less likely to be essential than SSDs to the finding that WGDs are more variably essential&#x02014;broadening the picture of WGD essentiality. Finally, synthetic lethal interactions observed between paralog pairs in budding yeast prompted us to investigate whether paralog buffering relationships could in part explain variable essentiality in cancer cell lines.

We restricted our set of paralog pairs to those which share 20% or more sequence identity in both directions, and where both genes are classified as protein-coding in the HGNC [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The paralogy information for each individual gene was summarized as the number of paralog pairs it is included in and the maximum percent of the gene&#x02019;s protein sequence that is matched in any of its paralogs. Genes were considered singletons if they did not appear in this summary.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Whole genome vs. small-scale duplicates</title><p>We classified the paralog pairs in our dataset as whole genome duplicates (WGDs) if they were included on either of two lists of WGD pairs: the pairs identified by [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and the high-confidence (strict) list identified by [<xref rid="pgen.1008466.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. All remaining paralog pairs in our dataset, i.e. which were not included on either of those lists, were classified as small-scale duplicates (SSDs).

Copenhaver</p><p>Editor-in-Chief</p><p>PLOS Genetics</p><p>The reviewers appreciated the work and the manuscript itself, but had several questions and suggestions that should be addressed. One major concern, which I also had after reading the manuscript, is that (as the authors know) cancer cell lines are well known to harbor extensive aneuploidy and copy number variation. How much of the background-specific non-essentiality could be explained by the presence of multiple copies of the gene or its paralog(s)?</p><p>Other reviewer comments of particular importance are:</p><p>- the need to provide more detail about how fitness is calculated</p><p>- questions/ suggestions about the statistical methods used (continuous versus discretized data and t-tests versus a regression model)</p><p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p><p><bold>Comments to the Authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Please note here if the review is uploaded as an attachment.</bold></p><p>Reviewer #1: In this paper, De Kegel &#x00026; Ryan investigate the contribution of paralogs to variation in gene essentiality across human cell lines. The authors re-analyze the DepMap dataset of CRISPR-Cas9 KO screens in &#x0003e;500 cancer cell lines to explore this question. Similar to previous studies in model organisms, they find that duplicated genes are less likely to be essential than singleton genes. They extend this finding by showing that duplicated genes also show more variation in essentiality across many different genetic backgrounds, something that has not yet been feasible to investigate in model organisms. They further investigate the underlying mechanisms driving the essentiality of genes with paralogs, such as the number of paralogs a gene has and the mode of duplication by which the paralogs occurred.</p><p>The paper is well-written, well-structured, and uses clear and precise language. All relevant data is included in the supplementary tables. The authors frequently refer to previous work done in other organisms, and - to my knowledge - cite all relevant literature. They clearly describe the used methods and have performed a thorough cleaning of the DepMap dataset before analysis.</p><p>While many of the findings in the article are intuitive given previous knowledge from model organisms, these observations have not previously been described in human cells. In addition, the authors take their work a step further than previous studies by looking at variability in gene essentiality among many different genetic backgrounds. This paper is thus certainly useful to the scientific community. However, I have a few comments, mainly about the detection and definition of differential essential genes (&#x0201c;sometimes essential genes&#x0201d;), which may affect all further downstream analyses.</p><p>Main comments:</p><p>1. Page 6/7 - &#x0201c;~86% of the genes that share 90% or more sequence identity with their closest paralog are targeted by at least one multi-target sgRNA in the Avana library&#x0201d;. Are there still 3 or more gRNAs remaining for these genes in the dataset, or have most of the highly similar paralogs been filtered out? If many or most of the highly similar genes have been removed, can the authors comment on how this affects the results?</p><p>2. Page 7/8 &#x02013; The authors describe how they use a single CRISPR score threshold (-0.47) to determine gene essentiality. This means that genes with an average score close to this cutoff would be classified as differential essential even though the actual scores may be very comparable across cell lines (for example -0.45 in some cell lines and -0.49 in others). In addition, genes with a score just below -0.47 in one cell line and above -0.47 in all others would be classified as differential essential. This could be prevented by for example excluding all scores in the -0.45 to -0.50 range. Could the authors comment and/or show data on the effect of their choice of this single threshold on the set of differential essential genes?</p><p>3. Page 6-8 - If a given cell line carries a mutation (compared to the reference genome) in the sequence targeted by a guide, this guide may be less efficient in this cell line. Could the authors comment on whether some of the observed differential essentiality could be caused by differences in guide efficiency due to mutations or other sequence differences between cell lines?</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. Page 13/14 - The authors use expression data to identify gene pairs where the essentiality of a gene A correlates with lower expression of its paralog B. I agree with the authors that these could indicate potential synthetic lethal relationships, but other explanations are also possible. Although at several places they describe these as &#x0201c;putative&#x0201d; synthetic lethal relationships, at other moments they talk in more definitive terms about synthetic lethal pairs. In my opinion, consistent use of more careful phrasing like &#x0201c;putative synthetic lethal pairs&#x0201d; would be preferable.</p><p>Reviewer #2: See uploaded attachment</p><p>Reviewer #3: In this study, De Kegel and Ryan examine the set of genes required for viability across 558 tumor cell lines, as determined by the DepMap project at the Broad institute. The authors investigate why certain genes are essential in all, some or none of the tested cell lines and to what extent this variability can be explained by gene duplication/paralogy. The authors report that, while paralogs are overall less likely to be essential, the ones that do have an essential phenotype in at least one context provide insight into the mechanisms of variable essentiality. Specifically, the probability of a gene being required for viability depends on the number of its cognate paralogs, their mutual sequence similarity and relative expression levels, as well as the nature of the duplication event they originated from.</p><p>I found this study to be very well designed, executed and described. The question posed is very interesting and takes great advantage of an extensive body of work in model organisms (i.e., yeast) as well as the latest technologies that have recently generated relevant datasets for human cancer cell lines. The analysis is thorough and rigorous, and the description of the results and interpretations is very clear and precise. I think this would be an important contribution to the field of functional genomics and cancer biology.</p><p>I don't have any major comments or suggestions on the manuscript.</p><p>A few minor comments are:</p><p>- The authors estimate that 13-17% of paralogs that are essential in some, but not all, cell lines are explained by their genetic dependence on a paralog partner that's variably expressed across the cell lines. Could the authors provide their intuition/speculation/preliminary insight into what could explain the other (more substantial) fraction of variably essential paralogs? Could it be synthetic lethality with other non-paralog genes that are also variably expressed across the cell lines? And if the genome-wide expression data for these cell lines is available, could one attempt to identify these synthetic lethal partners based on the correlation of their expression levels with fitness levels?</p><p>- Maybe I missed it throughout the text and the methods, but could the authors clarify where is their synthetic lethality data coming from? E.g., lines 290-294: "we found that among WGD paralog pairs, ~16.5% are synthetic lethal" -- what dataset was used to perform this assessment?</p><p>- Also, lines 303-305: "Approximately 19.1% of the paralog pairs consisting of at least one protein complex member gene are synthetic lethal, compared to only ~9.3% of the non-protein-complex pairs" -- what is the overall frequency of synthetic lethality among complex- and non-complex pairs (regardless of paralogy)?</p><p>**********</p><p><bold>Have all data underlying the figures and results presented in the manuscript been provided?</bold></p><p>Large-scale datasets should be made available via a public repository as described in the <italic>PLOS Genetics</italic>
