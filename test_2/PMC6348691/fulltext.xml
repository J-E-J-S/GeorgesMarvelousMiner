A tremendous number of secondary metabolites produced by <italic>Streptomyces</italic> were utilized as lead compounds in medicine such as clinically important anticancer, antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, anti-parasitic, antioxidant and anti-malaria drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, the production of many microbial drugs was very low in original strains because of the limitations of natural evolution. Meanwhile, genome analysis revealed that about 20&#x02013;40 biosynthesis gene clusters were distributed in each <italic>Streptomyces</italic>. However, most of these gene clusters were cryptic under standard laboratory conditions. Therefore, in fact, <italic>Streptomyces</italic> was a huge natural reservoir of secondary metabolites and it was quite necessary to implement secondary prospecting of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> to discover more novel drugs against multidrug-resistant bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, lots of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> were quite difficult to cultivate or even uncultivable under laboratory conditions, grown slowly, lacked efficient genetic manipulation, possessed complicated regulatory networks or produced a large number of endogenous by-products which impeded the progress of drug discovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Heterologous expression is an efficient method to improve the production of microbial drugs and trigger the cryptic gene clusters for drug discovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The most important aspect of heterologous expression was to choose an efficient <italic>chassis</italic>. Although many kinds of microorganisms like <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] could be utilized as <italic>chassis</italic>, a very large number of secondary metabolic gene clusters derived from <italic>Streptomyces</italic> could not or barely express in the <italic>chassis</italic> mentioned above because of the codon bias (high GC content) or unfitness of intrinsic regulatory networks or precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. To date, only several <italic>Streptomyces</italic> had been developed as <italic>chassis</italic> like <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> A3(2), <italic>Streptomyces avermitilis</italic> MA-4680, <italic>Streptomyces albus</italic> J1074, <italic>Streptomyces lividans</italic> TK24. However, there still existed many heterologous gene clusters that could not be activated or barely expressed in available <italic>Streptomyces chassis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, it was quite necessary to develop novel or even universal high-performance <italic>Streptomyces chassis</italic> to increase the yield of well-known drugs and accelerate bioprospecting of diverse microbial resources.</p><p id="Par35">With the development of high-throughput genome sequencing technology, a vast amount of complete genome sequences were available. Numerous researchers set about dissecting the functions of genomes and sophisticated cellular networks by comparative or functional genomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In 2005, the concept of pan-genome composed of core genome and dispensable genome that encompassed the complete repertoire of genes was proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In the evolutionary context, the core genome mainly contained highly conserved genes in each individual genome, however the dispensable or accessory genome consisted of genes present in two or more but not all genomes and strain-specific genes. From the perspective of functional genomics, the vast majority of essential genes responsible for the basic functions of cell viability such as replication, transcription, translation, energy metabolism, cell division, ribosomal structure and biogenesis, distributed mainly in the core genome region, and the dispensable genome region was devoted to adaptation, antibiotic resistance, cell movement, virulence, transposition, secondary metabolites, which were non-essential to maintain normal cellular functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Therefore, we assumed that the dispensable genome region can be deleted theoretically which may improve the performances of cells. According to the above hypothesis, construction of simplified or minimized genome by deleting non-essential genes based on systematic genome analyses would be feasible. A representative example of genome-minimized <italic>Streptomyces</italic> was the <italic>S. avermitilis</italic> SUKAs harboring 1.5&#x000a0;Mb-deletion which were constructed by Cre/<italic>loxP</italic>-mediated large deletion based on comparative genomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Recently, a cluster-free <italic>S. albus chassis</italic> was generated by deleting 15 endogenous biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) based on antiSMASH analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A <italic>S. coelicolor chassis</italic> was also constructed by deleting 4 endogenous BGCs and ribosome engineering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, there still remain most of the non-essential elements like genome islands (GIs), insertion sequences (ISs) and BGCs in these <italic>chassis</italic> genomes which may result in genome instability or metabolic burden. Meanwhile, construction of <italic>chassis</italic> by one-by-one deletion of endogenous BGCs was time-consuming and laborious. Besides, current methods of large-scale genome editing only based on comparative genomics are too blindfold to precisely predict essential genes, and there still exist no systematic methods to analyze large-scale non-essential regions accurately which seriously hinder the process to develop high-efficient <italic>chassis</italic>.</p><p id="Par36">Here, we developed a combinatorial strategy based on comparative, functional and pan-genomics to rationally design non-essential regions for construction of genome-reduced <italic>chassis</italic>. Meanwhile, the properties of many <italic>Streptomyces chassis</italic> were only evaluated by heterologous expression of BGCs or simplification of metabolic background which is too one-sided to reveal the intrinsic connection between genome streamline and emergent properties. Here, we firstly performed a systematic characterization of industrial <italic>Streptomyces chassis</italic> by phenotype changes, metabolic profiles, genetic stability, transformation efficiency, intracellular energy and reducing power, capability of protein expression and ability of heterologous expression of BGCs. This systematic evaluation will help us decipher the intrinsic relationships between genome reduction and the improved production of secondary metabolites.</p><p id="Par37"><italic>Streptomyces chattanoogensis</italic> L10 is the industrial producer of natamycin (Type I PKS) and has been proved a highly efficient host for the production of diverse natural products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Since it was mainly responsible for PKS natural products, it has an enormous potential to be developed as a versatile cell factory for production of polyketides. Here, we applied our strategy to rationally construct and systematically evaluate the genome-reduced <italic>S. chattanoogensis chassis</italic> based on multiple genome analyses. Our strategy could not only be widely applied in other <italic>Streptomyces</italic> to generate more miscellaneous and versatile <italic>chassis</italic> with minimized genome, and to accelerate the development of synthetic biology, but also help us understand the underlying mechanism between genome reduction and enhanced performances.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Determination of dispensable genetic elements</title><p id="Par38">The complete genome sequence of <italic>S. chattanoogensis</italic> L10 has been determined by Roche 454 GS FLX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. RAST server was used to perform genome annotation and KEGG analysis.</p><p id="Par39">Many studies had suggested that mobile genetic elements (MGEs), genomic islands (GIs) and biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs) were dispensable. So we firstly performed analysis of dispensable components by computational approaches like antiSMASH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], IslandViewer 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and ISsaga2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The results indicated that there were about 34 biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs), 20 genomic islands (GIs) and 105 IS elements, and most of them were located at the two sub-telomeric regions. A type I-E CRISPR/<italic>Cas</italic> system was found at 8,084,591&#x02013;8,095,933&#x000a0;bp by CRISPRfinder. It may decrease the efficiency of transformation or conjugation by targeting and degrading exogenous plasmids. The information of genome annotation and distribution of dispensable elements were visualized in the circular map of genome by Circos (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We can clearly see that these dispensable elements concentrated in both side of genome (0&#x02013;3.0&#x000a0;Mb and 7.4&#x02013;9.0&#x000a0;Mb). However, we cannot yet determine the boundary of non-essential regions because some essential genes may distribute at both sides. Locations of these redundant elements would help us to determine the candidate target deletion regions more rationally.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Circular map of <italic>S. chattanoogensis</italic> L10 genome.

Based on the assumption that essential genes were highly conserved during the process of evolution, we performed comparative analysis of five <italic>Streptomyces</italic> complete proteomes, <italic>S. albus</italic> J1074, <italic>S. avermitilis</italic> MA-4680, <italic>S. chattanoogensis</italic> L10, <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> A3(2) and <italic>S. griseus</italic> by OrthoVenn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The results suggested that about 2702 proteins were highly conserved in all the five <italic>Streptomyces</italic> proteomes, and 973 of them were function-unknown and others were mainly responsible for basic cellular functions like DNA replication, transcription, translation, ribosomal biogenesis and primary metabolism.</p><p id="Par41">In order to determine the functions and distributions of putative essential genes, we performed pan-genome and comparative genome analyses by Bacterial Pan Genome Analysis pipeline (BPGA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and Mauve 2.3.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The results revealed that the 9&#x000a0;Mb-size genome of <italic>S. chattanoogensis</italic> L10 consisted of about 6.0&#x000a0;Mb core genomic region around the origin of replication (<italic>oriC</italic>) with symmetry, and 2.0&#x000a0;Mb and 1.0&#x000a0;Mb dispensable (accessory) genome regions located at sub-telomeric regions of the chromosomal ends, respectively. Meanwhile, pan-genome analysis suggested that approximate 2650 genes are present in all individuals, which was virtually consistent with the OrthoVenn results. And the KEGG function analysis indicated that the two dispensable genome regions are mainly composed of non-essential genes like secondary metabolite-associated genes, strain-specific genes, transposition-associated genes which were not necessary for primary metabolism and robust cellular functions, and can be deleted theoretically. Local blast analysis revealed that the <italic>oriC</italic> and <italic>dnaA</italic> box-like sequences were located at 5,293,751&#x02013;5,294,960&#x000a0;bp which had about a deviation of 770&#x000a0;Kb to the center of chromosome. So the genome structure was asymmetric which indicated that the two non-essential regions may be also different in size (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Multiple genome alignments by Mauve 2.3.1.

</p><p id="Par42">Besides, we also submitted the whole-genome sequence to DEG 10 (Database of Essential Genes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and ARTS (Antibiotic Resistant Target Seeker) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] for determination of known essential and duplicated genes. The results indicated that about 589 genes were classified as essential genes in which 65 genes showed duplication. We focused on these duplicated genes located at each side of genome in which one can be deleted without affecting another. And we also found that some essential genes and their duplications appeared in 0&#x02013;0.5&#x000a0;Mb and 8.7&#x02013;9.0&#x000a0;Mb regions, respectively, which indicated that the two regions cannot be removed at the same time. Therefore, previously described two dispensable regions (0&#x02013;3.0&#x000a0;Mb and 7.4&#x02013;9.0&#x000a0;Mb) were reduced as 0.5&#x02013;3&#x000a0;Mb and 7.4&#x02013;8.7&#x000a0;Mb. We further analyzed other well-known essential genes and found that a large number of essential genes distributed in 7.5&#x02013;7.8&#x000a0;Mb and 1.9&#x02013;2.75&#x000a0;Mb. Finally, we chose the 0.5&#x02013;1.9&#x000a0;Mb and 8.0&#x02013;8.7&#x000a0;Mb regions as candidate non-essential regions.

The results suggested that Cre enzyme can work in <italic>S. chattanoogensis</italic> L10 with high efficiency and a new <italic>loxP</italic> site was formed. When we performed deletion of an 80&#x000a0;Kb <italic>trans</italic>-AT PKS gene cluster, the precise deletion of the targeted gene cluster was also observed with high frequency. The schematic diagram showed the procedure of pSATDF and pSATPR integrated into genome by homologous recombination and Cre-mediated site specific recombination (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par46">Subsequently, we chose to delete the two large dispensable genome regions.

Replica plating method was used to identify the mutants. We can see that all clones can growth on YMG plate without antibiotics but not on corresponding plate with spectinomycin (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The above results showed that site-specific recombination has taken place between the <italic>lox71</italic> and <italic>lox66</italic> site. PCR and sequencing had proven that the two large non-essential gene regions had been deleted. Finally, we successfully obtained the mutants with large deletions, 1.3&#x000a0;Mb and 0.7&#x000a0;Mb, named L320 and L321, respectively. However, when we tried to combine the two large deletions, mutant with combinatorial deletion could not be screened which indicated that the two large regions could not be deleted synchronously. We proposed that maybe some paired or complementary orthologous genes located in the two large regions functionally complement deletion of each other, therefore they could not be deleted simultaneously. Therefore, we performed functional analysis of every putative essential gene which was predicted by DEG (Database of essential genes) and found that some paired essential genes with same function were located at the two targeted regions (1.3&#x000a0;Mb and 0.7&#x000a0;Mb) separately. These paired essential genes like urease-associated genes (<italic>orf1441</italic> and <italic>orf7491</italic>, <italic>orf1443</italic> and <italic>orf7492</italic>, <italic>orf1445</italic> and <italic>orf7494</italic>), dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose 3,5-epimerase encoding genes (<italic>orf1209</italic> and <italic>orf7573</italic>), glycerol kinase encoding genes (<italic>orf2011</italic> and <italic>orf7622</italic>) and peptide deformylase encoding genes (<italic>orf1463</italic> and <italic>orf7856</italic>) involved in amino acid transport and metabolism, cell envelope biogenesis, energy production and conversion, translation or ribosomal structure and biogenesis processes, respectively. These processes, in particular cell envelope and ribosomal biogenesis, were fundamental for a life which indicated that synchronous deletion of these gene pairs will be lethal.

The results revealed that 9&#x000a0;Mb-size genome of <italic>S. chattanoogensis</italic> L10 consisted of about 6&#x000a0;Mb core region and 2.0&#x000a0;Mb and 1.0&#x000a0;Mb dispensable (accessory) regions located at sub-telomeric regions of the chromosomal ends, respectively. The core region mainly contained about 2700 essential genes which were conserved during the evolutionary process and some function-unknown genes. However, the dispensable regions were mainly composed of non-essential genes which were not necessary for primary metabolism and robust cellular functions and can be deleted theoretically. Meanwhile, we analyzed GIs, ISs, BGCs and CRISPR/Cas system which were deemed to be unnecessary and underlying candidate genes to be deleted for further genome reduction. In order to determine the boundary of non-essential regions, we investigated the functions and distributions of known essential genes by DEG10 and ARTS. In order to avoid synthetic lethality, we paid more attention to duplications of these essential genes. Finally, we took all these factors into account to determine two candidate non-essential regions which were deleted successfully.
