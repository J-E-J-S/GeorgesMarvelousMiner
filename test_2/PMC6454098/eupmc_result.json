    "The traditional healthcare system is at the doorstep for entering into the arena of molecular medicine. The enormous knowledge and ongoing research have now been able to demonstrate methodologies that can alter DNA coding. The techniques used to edit or change the genome evolved from the earlier attempts like nuclease technologies, homing endonucleases, and certain chemical methods. Molecular techniques like meganuclease, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) initially emerged as genome-editing technologies. These initial technologies suffer from lower specificity due to their off-targets side effects. Moreover, from biotechnology's perspective, the main obstacle was to develop simple but effective delivery methods for host cell entry. Later, small RNAs, including microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA), have been widely adopted in the research laboratories to replace lab animals and cell lines. The latest discovery of CRISPR/Cas9 technology seems more encouraging by providing better efficiency, feasibility, and multi-role clinical application. This later biotechnology seem to take genome-engineering techniques to the next level of molecular engineering. This review generally discusses the various gene-editing technologies in terms of the mechanisms of action, advantages, and side effects."
