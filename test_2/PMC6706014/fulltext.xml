In this study, we aimed to culture the functionally active fraction of an upland soil microbiome, which can suppress tomato bacterial wilt. The microbiome fraction (MF) from the rhizosphere of Hawaii 7996 treated with an upland soil or forest soil MF was successively cultured in a designed modified M9 (MM9) medium partially mimicking the nutrient composition of tomato root exudates. Bacterial cells were harvested to amplify V3 and V4 regions of 16S rRNA gene for QIIME based sequence analysis and were also treated to Hawaii 7996 prior to <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic> inoculation. The disease progress indicated that the upland MM9 1<sup>st</sup> transfer suppressed the bacterial wilt. Community analysis revealed that species richness was declined by successive cultivation of the MF. The upland MM9 1<sup>st</sup> transfer harbored population of phylum Proteobacteria (98.12%), Bacteriodetes (0.69%), Firmicutes (0.51%), Actinobacteria (0.08%), unidentified (0.54%), Cyanobacteria (0.01%), FBP (0.001%), OD1 (0.001%), Acidobacteria (0.005%). The family <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> of Proteobacteria was the dominant member (86.76%) of the total population of which genus <italic>Enterobacter</italic> composed 86.76% making it a potential candidate to suppress bacterial wilt. The results suggest that this mixed culture approach is feasible to harvest microorganisms which may function as biocontrol agents.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bacterial wilt suppression</kwd><kwd>biocontrol</kwd><kwd>rhizosphere microbiome</kwd><kwd>tomato</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The mutualistic interactions between plants and microorganisms culminate in a reciprocally beneficial environment (<xref rid="b8-ppj-35-362" ref-type="bibr">Bulgarelli et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="b30-ppj-35-362" ref-type="bibr">Turner et al., 2013</xref>).

The root exudates are composed of organic acids, amino acids and phenolics, and play an important role to establish plant-specific microbial communities in the rhizosphere (<xref rid="b29-ppj-35-362" ref-type="bibr">Sasse et al., 2018</xref>). Rhizosphere microbial communities are the most important player in the rhizosphere to make nutrients available to plants, produce phytohormores, degrade toxic compounds and suppress the soil-borne pathogens (<xref rid="b3-ppj-35-362" ref-type="bibr">Bais et al., 2006</xref>). It has been reported that the intricate and high microbial diversity in the soil and rhizosphere render it difficult to illustrate the functions of the microbial organization (<xref rid="b5-ppj-35-362" ref-type="bibr">Berendsen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Various studies have been conducted by establishing model host with simplified and defined microbial communities to dissect the interactions between the host plant and defined communities (<xref rid="b2-ppj-35-362" ref-type="bibr">Bai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="b7-ppj-35-362" ref-type="bibr">Bodenhausen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="b20-ppj-35-362" ref-type="bibr">Lebeis et al., 2015</xref>). A study by <xref rid="b7-ppj-35-362" ref-type="bibr">Bodenhausen et al. (2014)</xref> has used a synthetic community approach to reveal that genotype of plants dictates the microbiota structure. The synthetic community approach in gnotobiotic systems makes it possible to take reductionist approaches to understand the role of community function as well as individual microorganisms (<xref rid="b32-ppj-35-362" ref-type="bibr">Vorholt et al., 2017</xref>). However, if one can culture microbial community <italic>per se</italic>, it would better resemble the natural microbiota to understand the role of the microbial community under defined <italic>in vivo</italic> condition. Therefore, this study, focus on reproducing a simplified and representative microbial community using the microbial mixed culture from the rhizosphere making plants either disease suppressive or disease conducive.</p><p>In this study we aimed to; (i) attempt to culture the major portion of the tomato rhizosphere microbial community <italic>per se</italic> as a mixed culture; (ii) to culture the functionally active fraction of an upland soil microbiome, capable of conferring quantitative resistance against tomato bacterial wilt caused by <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic>. To do this, we used soil slurries (herein we coined terminology microbial fraction, MF) from two different soils. One of the soils was from upland soil that tomato plants have been cultivated, and the other soil was forest soil. Simply, soil slurries (i.e. MF) prepared from two different soils has been treated to tomato seedlings and the rhizosphere soils were harvested to subject microbiota cultivation.</p><p>The challenge to detail out the microbial community assemblage and function is directly proportional to the complexity of such microbial community. However, the microbial community harvested from our designed media, modified M9, is comparatively simpler than the community harvested from the tomato rhizosphere. Here, this study showed that our simplified mixed culture could define microbial alliance for bacterial wilt suppression in tomato and make it even possible to isolate microorganisms with biocontrol potential.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant material, growth conditions, pathogen culture and inoculum preparation</title><p>The plant used in this study was tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> cv.

Our approach in this study attempted to harvest the microbial community from tomato rhizosphere to have a relatively simpler bacterial community using mixed culture. We have investigated if the simpler cultured bacterial community still maintains the original microbiota function of the community to suppress the bacterial wilt disease. This is the first report to partially harvest the rhizosphere associated microbiota capable of retaining the bacterial wilt suppression function of the original microbiota of tomato rhizosphere.</p><p>Since, the microbial communities in the rhizosphere differ and depend on the resources, space and time (Fierer, 2007), MM9 media-based harvests was an idealistic approach to mimic such an environment and to allow culturing of maximum number of microorganisms from rhizosphere. The resultant communities harvested from the designed media were less diverse and simpler than those of the original MF. The discrepancy between the cultured bacterial population and the rhizosphere bacterial population is inevitable; the inability to culture the whole community has already been widely recognized (<xref rid="b16-ppj-35-362" ref-type="bibr">Hirsch and Mauchline, 2012</xref>). While an estimated less than 1% of the microorganisms can be grown routinely from various microbial ecosystem on the standard culture media (<xref rid="b1-ppj-35-362" ref-type="bibr">Amann et al., 1995</xref>), it has been also shown that over 66% plant associated microorganism can be cultured (<xref rid="b2-ppj-35-362" ref-type="bibr">Bai et al., 2015</xref>). However, previous approaches are usually dependent on agar medium to have pure cultures of single isolates. Our designed media however, shows an ability to support growth of microorganisms to a greater extent using mixed culture approach (Supplementary Table 4 and 5). The composition of the upland MM9 bacterial community harvested harbored 50.64% of the original upland rhizosphere community. The bacterial wilt incidence (<xref rid="f1-ppj-35-362" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) shows that there is significant difference between the occurrence of disease between control plants and plants under upland MM9 treatment and between control plants and plants under upland MM9 1<sup>st</sup> Tra treatment, but no significant difference between plants under upland MM9 treatment and plants under upland MM9 1<sup>st</sup> Tra treatment. This suggests that the community cultured from upland MM9 is capable of conferring the original microbiota function, <italic>i.e</italic>. bacterial wilt suppression. Not only has it the potential to confer bacterial wilt suppression but also has a larger bacterial community compared to the upland MM9 1<sup>st</sup> Tra community. Hence, this may be used as potential source of making a representative synthetic community.</p><p>A gargantuan number of microorganisms are associated with the plants, and to pin the properties of such humungous microbial community to specific roles is rather difficult (<xref rid="b5-ppj-35-362" ref-type="bibr">Berendsen et al., 2012</xref>). The relatively simpler community structures of upland and forest of MM9 media and subsequent cultures, gives an insight into the potential role of <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> members possibly involved in suppressing bacterial wilt disease (<xref rid="s1-ppj-35-362" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Here, we isolated and identified a bacterial isolate that were predominant in the mixed culture. The 97% identity of 16S rRNA gene between the <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> isolate and OTU0 sequence is due to the fact that the sequence for OTU0 is a representative sequence generated by the USEARCH algorithm. This step clusters the amplicon sequences and each cluster are defined by a centroid, which is the representative amplicon sequence and every sequence in the cluster has a similarity above the 97% identity threshold (<xref rid="b12-ppj-35-362" ref-type="bibr">Edgar, 2010</xref>). The treatment of <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> isolate in non-sterilized soil successfully suppressed the occurrence of the bacterial wilt disease; however, its treatment in sterilized soil failed to confer the disease suppression (<xref rid="f5-ppj-35-362" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). The phenomena can be attributed to the potential disease suppression ability of this strain in presence of other bacterial members as a community rather than independently. A member of family <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic>, has been shown to act as keystone species in successfully inhibiting the disease in a model system of synthetic bacterial community (<xref rid="b26-ppj-35-362" ref-type="bibr">Niu et al., 2017</xref>). The results of this study provide a precedence to take into account the potential role of members of <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> as keystone species which may help structure a community which is beneficial to the plants. The structure of the communities harvested from the MM9 1<sup>st</sup> Tra media for upland and those of forest differed. A list of the top ten families from both culture medium shows different families. <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonadaceae</italic>, <italic>Sphingomonadaceae</italic> and <italic>Comamonadaceae</italic> in both cultures represented the top ten families, but with different relative abundance values. The RA of most abundant family, <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, across both cultures was significantly different (<xref rid="s1-ppj-35-362" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). The population of the common families varied between the cultured members from MM9 1<sup>st</sup> Tra for upland and those of forest MM9 1<sup>st</sup> Tra, and the members of both the communities were also different. The members of Proteobacteria, such as <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Enterobacter</italic> (<xref rid="b22-ppj-35-362" ref-type="bibr">Lwin and Ranamukhaarachchi, 2006</xref>) and Firmicutes, such as <italic>Bacillus</italic> (<xref rid="b9-ppj-35-362" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="b11-ppj-35-362" ref-type="bibr">Da Silveira et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="b33-ppj-35-362" ref-type="bibr">Wydra and Semrau, 2005</xref>) and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp (<xref rid="b21-ppj-35-362" ref-type="bibr">Lemessa and Zeller, 2007</xref>) has been reported as biocontrol agents against <italic>R. solanacearum</italic>. Although we have not isolated those bacteria from our mixed culture, such members seem to be also major bacterial members present in our MM9 mixed culture from the upland tomato rhizosphere.</p><p>In conclusion, MM9 medium approach was successful to cultivate a portion of the original microbiota of tomato rhizosphere, capable of retaining the bacterial wilt suppression trait. This approach can potentially be utilized to isolate potential key player of microbial community function for the construction of simpler synthetic bacterial communities. Yet, it remains to be evaluated what degree of synthetic microbial community harbored from the designed growth media is maintained in terms of community structure and the associated phenotypic traits in the plant rhizosphere.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplemental Materials</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="s1-ppj-35-362"><media xlink:href="PPJ-35-362_Supple.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1020" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was supported by the Cooperative Research Program for Agricultural Science &#x00026; Technology Development to S.-W.
