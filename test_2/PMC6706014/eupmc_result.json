    "Plant phenotype is affected by a community of associated microorganisms which requires dissection of the functional fraction. In this study, we aimed to culture the functionally active fraction of an upland soil microbiome, which can suppress tomato bacterial wilt. The microbiome fraction (MF) from the rhizosphere of Hawaii 7996 treated with an upland soil or forest soil MF was successively cultured in a designed modified M9 (MM9) medium partially mimicking the nutrient composition of tomato root exudates. Bacterial cells were harvested to amplify V3 and V4 regions of 16S rRNA gene for QIIME based sequence analysis and were also treated to Hawaii 7996 prior to Ralstonia solanacearum inoculation. The disease progress indicated that the upland MM9 1st transfer suppressed the bacterial wilt. Community analysis revealed that species richness was declined by successive cultivation of the MF. The upland MM9 1st transfer harbored population of phylum Proteobacteria (98.12%), Bacteriodetes (0.69%), Firmicutes (0.51%), Actinobacteria (0.08%), unidentified (0.54%), Cyanobacteria (0.01%), FBP (0.001%), OD1 (0.001%), Acidobacteria (0.005%). The family Enterobacteriaceae of Proteobacteria was the dominant member (86.76%) of the total population of which genus Enterobacter composed 86.76% making it a potential candidate to suppress bacterial wilt. The results suggest that this mixed culture approach is feasible to harvest microorganisms which may function as biocontrol agents."
