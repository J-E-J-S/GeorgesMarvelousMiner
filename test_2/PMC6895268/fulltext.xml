Repair of AP lesions takes place predominantly by the base excision pathway (BER).

Here, we employed two types of reporter constructs accommodating synthetic APE1-resistant AP lesions to investigate the auxiliary repair mechanisms in human cells. By combined analyses of recovery of the transcription rate and suppression of transcriptional mutagenesis at specifically positioned AP lesions, we demonstrate that nucleotide excision repair pathway (NER) efficiently removes BER-resistant AP lesions and significantly enhances the repair of APE1-sensitive ones.

Such apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lesions are constantly generated in DNA by spontaneous hydrolytic reactions and by multiple damage-induced mechanisms (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), including enzymatic removal of various nucleobase modifications by DNA glycosylases in the course of base excision repair (BER) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Because of their abundance and toxicity, AP sites demand a very efficient repair mechanism. In organisms from bacteria to higher eukaryotes, this is assured primarily by activity of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleases, such as human APE1 that generates a hydroxylated 3&#x02032;-end required for the downstream BER reactions (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The nuclease activity of APE1 (also annotated as HAP1 and REV1, based on its several known functions) is fundamental for protection of cells from accumulation of endogenously arising abasic DNA lesions (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Accordingly, the APEX1 gene is essential for early embryonic development in mouse (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref>) and indispensable for growth and survival of human and mouse cell cultures already under physiological DNA damage loads (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Severity of phenotypes caused by the APE1 deficiency thus underscores high toxicity of AP sites and vital importance of the repair.</p><p>Most types of AP lesions arising in DNA can assume interconverting constitutions between the furanose and hydroxyaldehyde forms (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). It is important to note that the aldehyde at the deoxyribose C1 atom can readily react with nucleophilic groups, leading to strand breakage (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;15</xref>) or adduct formation with proteins (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;21</xref>), DNA (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;25</xref>) and small molecules (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Repair of such structurally heterogeneous secondary lesions is challenging, because some of them cannot be efficiently processed by human APE1 (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;30</xref>). Since APE1-resistant AP lesions are expected to arise under physiological conditions in the cellular milieu, an additional repair mechanism would be required to protect cells from their toxicity. Based on previous biochemical and genetic evidence, the mechanism in question could be nucleotide excision repair (NER). Thus, Uvr ABC complex of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as well as human NER competent cell extracts efficiently recognize and cleave several types of AP lesions (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Furthermore, synergistic phenotypes of mutants with combined BER and NER defects in bacteria (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and yeast (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;37</xref>) indicate that the two pathways functionally overlap during <italic>in vivo</italic> processing of various BER substrates, most likely at the AP site step (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). However, <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that NER contributes to repair of AP lesions remains largely indirect and it is not known whether some of the mechanisms proposed for unicellular organisms also apply to mammalian cells.</p><p>Poor chemical stability of AP sites and their sensitivity to a number of ubiquitous endonucleases, along with the lack of tools for direct specific generation of AP sites in chromosomal DNA, have been the major obstacles to comprehensive characterization of pathways, which would complement BER during repair of AP lesions in cells. Another serious hindrance is the essential nature and diversity of functions of mammalian APE1. To overcome these difficulties, we here employed synthetic BER-resistant AP lesions. We generated reporter vectors harboring such lesions at defined nucleotide positions and employed two independent gene reactivation principles to directly assess contribution of NER to repair.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Immortalized human skin fibroblasts from patients with mutations in the specified nucleotide excision repair genes were obtained from the NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository, Coriell Institute for Medical Research (Camden, New Jersey, USA).

Accordingly, NER of a number of structurally defined DNA lesions was efficiently measured by a host cell reactivation (HCR) principle, using reporter constructs harbouring a stretch of synthetic DNA with a lesion in the transcribed strand of a reporter gene (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). To adjust the HCR approach towards specific measurement of NER of abasic sites, it was necessary to exclude the AP site lyase and endonuclease activities associated with the concurrent BER pathway. Because of the multiplicity of proteins with AP site lyase function and the essential character of human APE1 in human cells, a genetic knockout approach cannot be applied to fully inactivate BER. Therefore, our strategy was to generate a BER-resistant apurinic lesion at a unique position in the transcribed DNA strand of a reporter expression construct (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">B</xref>). To produce such a lesion, we used a chemically stable 2-hydroxymethyl-3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran (THF) building block, which is a close structural 1,2-dideoxy analogue of the most frequently occurring (&#x0003e;99%) cyclic furanose form of the natural 2-deoxyribose AP sites (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Because of the absent C1 hydroxyl group, THF is resistant to &#x003b2;-lyases but remains an excellent substrate of APE1, in agreement with its structural equivalence to natural AP sites (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Importantly, APE1 endonucleolytic cleavage at the THF lesion can be prevented <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> by sulfurization of the 5&#x02032; phosphodiester bond (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Therefore, we further substituted the linkage 5&#x02032; to THF with a phosphorothioate (subsequently referred to as S-THF lesion). As expected, the presence of the phosphorothioate markedly inhibited strand cleavage by purified human APE1 in the circular plasmid DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), whereas the THF substrate was fully converted into the nicked circular form at the equivalent APE1 concentrations. This clearly indicates that the THF lesions were efficiently introduced into practically all plasmid molecules by site-specific ligation of the synthetic oligonucleotides and implies that the S-THF AP lesion introduced into the reporter vector is resistant to BER (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>&#x000a0;for a quantitative comparison of the APE1 activities towards the THF and S-THF substrates). A minor degree of the non-specific nicking of constructs harbouring unmodified oligonucleotide (designated &#x02018;dG&#x02019; or &#x02018;dA&#x02019;) is normal and attributable to cleavage of AP sites, inherently present in plasmid DNA isolated from bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-2"><title>BER-resistant AP lesion hinders transcription</title><p>Human XP20S (GM04312) cells derived from an XP-A patient have no detectable NER activity (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Thus, to determine whether the BER-resistant AP lesion in the 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR) of the EGFP gene elicits transcription block in the absence of repair, we transfected the obtained reporter construct into XP-A cells. In parallel, we analysed analogous constructs containing bona fide transcription blocking DNA lesions TT dimer and the dG(<italic>N<sup>2</sup></italic>)-AAF adduct (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Yet another bulky DNA modification analysed was fluorescein-dT adduct, whose transcription blocking potential was unknown. Quantitative analyses of the EGFP expression in transfected cells showed that transcription was inhibited by a factor of 2.5 by a single S-THF lesion in the transcribed strand of the gene as compared to the control construct containing deoxyguanosine in the same position (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Since phosphorothioate bonds by themselves do not hinder gene expression (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), the observed impairment of transcription should be attributed to the presence of unrepaired AP site. As expected, both dG(<italic>N<sup>2</sup></italic>)-AAF at the same nucleotide and TT-dimer at an adjacent position in the 5&#x02032;UTR abrogated the EGFP expression almost completely. Of further note is that bulky fluorescein-dT adduct did not cause any significant decrease of gene expression. Comparison between the S-THF and fluorescein-dT lesions thus suggests that there is no direct relationship between the adduct size and the impediment to transcription in cells. Because the impact of abasic site on the EGFP expression is much weaker than the effects of TT dimer and dG(<italic>N<sup>2</sup></italic>)-AAF, we assume that AP site does not inflict a permanent blockage to transcribing RNA polymerase II; however, it clearly results in a marked decrease of the elongation rate as compared to undamaged DNA. Such a mechanism would be consistent with a &#x02018;slow bypass&#x02019; mode, previously reported for yeast RNA polymerase II under reconstituted transcription conditions (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-3"><title>XPA promotes removal of transcription blocking AP lesions</title><p>Complementation with a functional XPA gene restores NER capacity in XP-A cells (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Hence, to determine whether NER can remove transcription blocking AP lesions, we next assessed the expression of reporter constructs containing synthetic S-THF and dG(<italic>N<sup>2</sup></italic>)-AAF lesions in the available isogenic cell line complemented with XPA cDNA. In the XPA-complemented (GM15876) cells, we observed two populations with different levels of expression of the reporter construct carrying the dG(<italic>N<sup>2</sup></italic>)-AAF adduct (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The great part of transfected cells displayed a very efficient recovery of gene expression, which clearly indicates that XPA complementation rescued the NER capacity. The presence of a smaller cell population with persistent NER defect suggests that this fraction of cells did not express XPA. Importantly, complementation with functional XPA gene also resulted in a very efficient reactivation of the construct carrying the BER-resistant AP lesion S-THF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Because inhibition of transcription by S-THF is much weaker than in the case of dG(<italic>N<sup>2</sup></italic>)-AAF, the fluorescence distribution analyses could not resolve the minor NER-deficient cell population in this case. Nevertheless, even based on the median overall fluorescence, the effect of XPA was highly significant, as confirmed by six independent experiments. Moreover, reactivation of constructs containing AP lesion with normal 5&#x02032; phosphodiester bond (THF) was also significantly improved by XPA complementation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>), despite susceptibility of the latter lesion to APE1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). In the case of the APE1 substrate (THF), the recovery of gene expression was somewhat less pronounced than for the BER-resistant AP lesion (S-THF). We previously showed in various cell models that a pre-existing nick (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) or nicks generated by APE1 next to various BER substrates&#x02014;including the THF lesion (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>)&#x02014;induce transcriptional silencing of reporter transgenes. Under the conditions of complementation with a functional XPA gene, the strand scission by APE1 takes place concurrently to NER activity, which results in a less complete reactivation of the THF than of the S-THF reporter construct (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In summary, the results show that XPA significantly improves repair of AP lesions both in the absence and in the presence of BER.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Reactivation of expression constructs containing AP lesions by complementation with XPA.

Because previous reports suggested that TC-NER contributes to processing of AP lesions in yeast (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>) and since we earlier found that AP lesion has a considerable transcription blocking capacity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), we assessed HCR of constructs containing single S-THF lesion in TC-NER deficient cells derived from patients of two different complementation groups (CS-A and CS-B). In parallel, we analysed constructs carrying dG(<italic>N<sup>2</sup></italic>)-AAF adduct at the same nucleotide position as a reference DNA lesion that is efficiently repaired by TC-NER but cannot be recognized by human GG-NER (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Surprisingly, the impact of the AP lesion on the gene expression in CS-A and CS-B cell lines was as mild as in fully NER proficient MRC-5 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">C</xref>), even though the TC-NER deficiency was clearly confirmed in both cell lines by severely impaired HCR of the dG(<italic>N<sup>2</sup></italic>)-AAF reporter construct (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). In the XP-C cells, we observed a somewhat stronger impact of the S-THF lesion on the EGFP gene expression&#x02014;despite a very efficient TC-NER of the dG(<italic>N<sup>2</sup></italic>)-AAF adduct in this cell line. Even if it was minor in the magnitude, this effect was reproducible and statistically significant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), thus suggesting that recognition of abasic lesions is slightly compromised in the absence of GG-NER. Nevertheless, judging by sensitivity to the AP lesion, we conclude that none of the mutations that selectively affect either TC-NER or GG-NER damage recognition pathway yields a phenotype equivalent to a total NER deficiency (as in XPA- or XPF-null cells). Functional CSA and CSB genes are both essential for TC-NER and so is XPC for GG-NER. Thus, unless we hypothesize the existence of a hitherto unknown third damage recognition principle within NER, it is reasonable to assume that both GG-NER and TC-NER can initiate removal of transcription blocking AP lesions from DNA.</p><p>As an additional point, we want to stress that, despite the different genetic background of cell models used, the defects in the XPA and XPF genes resulted in quantitatively identical functional outcomes of the AP lesion in the HCR assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Considering that both XPA and XPF have essential functions in the NER pathway, such a result exactly meets expectations for a bona fide NER substrate. Thus, reactivation of reporter constructs containing the reference NER substrate dG(<italic>N<sup>2</sup></italic>)-AAF also equally required XPA and XPF (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-5"><title>Transcriptional bypass of AP site results in mutant RNA</title><p>Considering that GG-NER and TC-NER both can initiate repair of AP lesions in transcribed DNA, it would be interesting to know which of the two damage recognition pathways dominates in human cells. However, because the reporter gene reactivation in cells with selective defects in either GG-NER or TC-NER closely approached the levels observed in fully NER proficient host cells, we could not judge about relative efficiencies of GG-NER and TC-NER in quantitative terms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Seeking to improve the sensitivity, we generated expression constructs with single AP lesion placed at varying distances from the transcription start in a hope to achieve a more pronounced impairment of transcriptional elongation at some position. However, we observed only slight variation of the degree of transcriptional blockage by AP lesions at different positions (data not shown). We then decided to make use of the high miscoding potential of abasic lesions, which led us to construction of a positive readout reporter for detection of ribonucleotide misincorporation at the AP lesion site during transcription (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Such RNA polymerase errors at the damage sites are widely termed as transcriptional mutagenesis (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Because of the lack of consensus in the literature about the nature of ribonucleotide preferentially incorporated by human RNA polymerase II opposite to AP lesions in the DNA template (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), we were aiming at a reporter system in which any misincorporated ribonucleotide would result in a reversal to a fluorescent EGFP. From the analysed single nucleotide substitutions leading to the non-fluorescent phenotype, we selected the c.613C&#x0003e;T chain termination mutant encoding for a truncated EGFP Q205* protein, because we found in a phenotypic screen that subsequent substitutions of 613A in the transcribed DNA strand for any other nucleotide efficiently restored the EGFP fluorescence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Transcriptional mutagenesis at the BER-resistant abasic site in the template DNA and its suppression by NER.

Generation and biochemical characterization of the EGFP Q205* constructs containing synthetic AP lesions (THF or S-THF) at the nucleotide 613 is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>. Expression analyses of the EGFP Q205* construct containing a single BER-resistant AP lesion (S-THF) at the nucleotide 613 revealed a pronounced gain of EGFP fluorescence in transfected cells in comparison with a reference construct containing dA, thus indicating that transcriptional bypass of the AP lesion is accompanied with a high error rate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The reversal to the fluorescent EGFP phenotype was clearly observed in MRC-5 cells (the group of panels on the left) and further greatly enhanced in NER deficient XP-A cells (the group of panels on the right). In the XP-A cells, this corresponded to at least&#x000a0;60-fold increase of the median EGFP fluorescence intensity over the background expression of the reference dA construct. In contrast, the AP lesion susceptible to APE1 (THF) did not lead to re-gain of the EGFP fluorescence, thus indicating that transcriptional mutagenesis was efficiently prevented by BER. In summary, the results imply that BER of AP lesions is normally accomplished within a very short time, which does not allow synthesis of significant amounts of mutant mRNA (as in the case of THF). However, if BER is compromised (as in the case of S-THF), prolonged persistence of AP lesions leads to phenotypically relevant accumulation of mutant transcripts. The results further show that the proportion of mutant mRNA becomes overwhelming if both BER and NER are unavailable.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-6"><title>Multiple NER pathway components protect from transcriptional mutagenesis at AP sites</title><p>Highly efficient reversion to the fluorescent phenotype inflicted by erroneous transcriptional bypass of unrepaired AP site now provided a sufficiently broad dynamic range for determination of specific contributions of the TC-NER and GG-NER subpathways to repair of AP lesions, based on the inverse relationship between NER capacity of host cells and the resulting EGFP fluorescence intensity. We therefore measured the gain of EGFP fluorescence in cell lines derived from patients of different NER complementation groups following transfections with the EGFP 613C&#x0003e;T reporter constructs containing THF or S-THF at the nucleotide 613 of the transcribed DNA strand (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). We observed that the presence of the APE1-sensitive THF lesion did not induce any significant increase of the EGFP fluorescent signal compared to the reference construct containing dA at the same position, which is in agreement with efficient BER of this type of AP lesion in all cell lines. In contrast, S-THF lesion caused strong increase of the EGFP fluorescence in all cell lines tested, thus indicating significant levels of ribonucleotide misincorporation at the lesion site. Furthermore, these levels were measurably increased in all NER complementation groups as compared to NER proficient MRC-5 cell line. Thus, based on median EGFP fluorescence intensity in transfected cells, a defect in the TC-NER pathway doubled the frequency of reversion to functional EGFP, no matter whether the affected gene was CSA or CSB. Inactivation of the GG-NER pathway (in XP-C cells) caused an even stronger (4-fold) increase of the transcriptional mutagenesis rate. The strongest (almost 8-fold) gain of the EGFP signal was documented in the XP-A cell line, in which both GG-NER and TC-NER are not functional. On the other hand, complementation with functional XPA gene significantly reduced the EGFP fluorescence intensity in the XP-A cell line, which proves that restoration of the NER function counteracts the transcriptional mutagenesis. Taken together, the results indicate that both GG-NER and, to a lesser extent, TC-NER account for repair of the mutagenic AP lesion in human cells.</p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Transcriptional mutagenesis by THF and S-THF lesions in the panel of NER deficient cell lines: overlaid fluorescence distribution plots from a representative experiment and a bar chart showing quantification of the EGFP expression of the specified pEGFP Q205* constructs, relative to the original EGFP without modification in the transcribed DNA strand (ts.613G).

Most common treatments used to generate AP lesions in the genome DNA of mammalian cells are alkylating substances and ionizing radiation. Because these agents have complex damage spectra and since the resulting lesions (including AP sites) are chemically labile, it is not possible to assign the observed effects strictly to AP lesions. As an alternative approach, AP lesions can be generated in a controlled way in DNA of external origin and subsequently delivered to cells to investigate the repair. A recent report proposed a host cell reactivation setup to determine variations of BER capacity between human cell lines towards synthetic AP sites introduced at specific nucleotide positions in DNA (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). An important advantage of such experimental system is the possibility to use chemically stable AP lesions in order to prevent their decay and uncontrolled reactivity, once delivered to cells. Among several AP site analogues characterized, THF has the closest structural similarity to naturally occurring AP sites (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Because of the lack of the aldehyde group on C1 atom, THF in DNA cannot undergo enzymatic &#x003b2;-elimination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>) and is essentially deprived of chemical reactivity under physiological conditions. At the same time, it remains an excellent substrate for APE1 (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>) as well as ideal model for structural studies (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Importantly, THF lesions can be further modified by sulfurization of the 5&#x02032; phosphodiester linkage to render them resistant to APE1 (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>) without causing a significant structural alteration of the DNA helix (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Here, we used these properties to generate reporters suited for analyses of alternative repair mechanisms in human cells with unaltered APE1 function. Combination of the constructs carrying THF with APE1-resistant (phosphorothioate) and APE1-sensitive (phosphodiester) 5&#x02032; linkages gave us possibility to compare functional outcomes of AP lesions in the absence and in the presence of BER in genetically and physiologically unperturbed cells.</p><p>Using two independent gene reactivation principles, we revealed important molecular details of toxicity of AP sites in transcribed DNA. By analysing outcomes of the BER-resistant AP lesion in cell lines with critical NER defects (XP-A, XPF KO), we documented mild impairment of transcription efficiency by the lesion positioned in a non-coding region of the transcribed DNA strand (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and confirmed high miscoding potential of the AP lesion during transcription (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Both ability of THF to block transcription and its capacity to induce transcriptional mutagenesis are overall in agreement with results reported by Samson <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>); however, the lesion used by others was not resistant to APE1 and possible contribution of NER to the repair was not considered at the time of previous publication. It seems that the degree of transcription blockage by THF might have been greatly overestimated formerly and it may be useful to adjust interpretation of the available quantitative data considering our new findings.</p><p>Further, and most importantly, we obtained clear evidence of contribution of NER to repair of AP lesions in human cells. We showed in two pairs of isogenic cell lines with opposite NER statuses that NER rescued the expression of constructs containing transcription blocking AP lesions (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Independently, using a different reporter system, we found that NER deficiency leads to massive increase of transcriptional mutagenesis specifically at the AP site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Both effects are most strongly pronounced at the APE1-resistant AP lesions. The very high (up to 80%) rate of reversal to the fluorescent EGFP phenotype by transcriptional mutagenesis in XP-A cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) corroborates the assumption that S-THF lesion is resistant to BER in cells. Taken together, the results strongly suggest that NER is an important backup pathway for the repair of AP lesions under the conditions when the 5&#x02032; endonucleolytic cleavage cannot take place. Extrapolated to physiological conditions of DNA damage, this result means that NER could be of vital importance for the repair of subclasses of APE1-resistant AP lesions, such as deoxyribose rests whose C1 atom is reduced or covalently bound to a stable chemical group (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;30</xref>).</p><p>Differently from S-THF, the APE1-sensitive THF lesion did not induce transcriptional mutagenesis; however, the XPA complementation significantly reduced the degree of transcriptional impairment in its presence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The results thus imply that NER activity parallels or complements BER also at the APE1-sensitive AP lesion by removing some transcription blocking structure. In the case of THF, this could be either the AP lesion itself or its strand-cleaved product generated by APE1.</p><p>Based on the recovery of gene expression levels, we deduce that both GG-NER and TC-NER can recognize AP lesions in transcribed DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Furthermore, using the levels of transcriptional mutagenesis at the nucleotide opposite to the BER-resistant AP lesion as a marker for NER impairment, we can derive quantitative estimates for the fractions of AP lesions processed by each of the NER subpathways. Assuming a constant RNA polymerase error rate at the AP lesion with the likelihood of incorporation of a wrong ribonucleotide smaller than 1, the doubled rates of reversal to a fluorescent EGFP in the Cockayne syndrome (CS-A and CS-B) cell lines should reflect at least a 2-fold decrease in the repair efficiency in the absence of TC-NER (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Proportionally, the 4-fold gain of EGFP fluorescence in the XP-C cell line indicates an even more profound impairment of repair in the absence of GG-NER. Ultimately, further increase of the phenotypic mutation rate in the XP-A cell line to almost 80% clearly indicates a severe impairment or even a complete absence of repair.</p><p>Although not reported to date in human systems, contribution of NER to repair of AP lesions is not entirely unexpected. Ample genetic and functional data strongly suggested a protective role of NER against depurination damage in yeast (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;37</xref>), pointing in particular to the roles of the TC-NER pathway components (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). However, extrapolation of these conclusions onto human NER needs caution. According to current view, the TC-NER damage recognition mechanism is initiated by arrest of an elongating RNA polymerase complex at the lesion (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). It is uncertain whether AP lesions have a transcription blocking capacity to a degree necessary for the TC-NER activation. Even though RNA synthesis by mammalian RNA polymerase II is robustly interrupted by &#x02018;natural&#x02019; deoxyribose AP lesions (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>), the likely cause of the observed premature termination of transcription was either enzymatic or chemical decay of this very labile AP lesion in the template DNA (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). In contrast, structurally analogous stable THF lesions can be bypassed with rather high efficiencies by human RNA polymerase II (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>) and induce merely a transient stalling of the yeast Pol II (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Arguably, the observed kinetic barrier could be sufficient to launch TC-NER (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Our observation of some residual NER capacity towards BER-resistant AP lesion in the GG-NER deficient XP-C cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) in principle supports this view. Nevertheless, as far as it can be judged from current results (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), TC-NER is not the predominant pathway in human cells and AP lesions can be processed even more efficiently by GG-NER. It is thus intriguing to propose that NER would likely act also on AP lesions in the non-transcribed DNA strand and elsewhere throughout the genome. Unfortunately, we could not test this presumption in our reporter system, because S-THF lesion in the non-transcribed DNA strand did not interfere with the gene expression to a significant extent (data not shown).</p><p>The finding that NER contributes to repair of AP lesion may have great importance for understanding of biological outcomes of this type of DNA damage. The estimated rate of spontaneous generation of AP lesions in the human cell genome exceeds 10&#x000a0;000/day and this load can be greatly increased under exposure to exogenous damaging agents (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Depending on the nature of the damaging agent, a broad spectrum of structurally related but chemically diverse AP lesions can arise in DNA, which include so-called &#x02018;classic&#x02019; AP sites generated by chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis of the N-glycosydic bond and various species of oxidized AP lesions arising from reactions of deoxyribose with free radicals (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). Not all forms of AP lesions are efficiently processed by BER and some undergo chemical reactions leading to BER-resistant damage, which would have been deleterious if there were no backup repair mechanism. Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients with impaired NER often suffer from neurological conditions and manifest degenerative features that have not been clearly linked to the classical NER substrates. Considering that AP sites commonly arise spontaneously or as intermediate products during BER of multiple types of DNA lesions (including endogenously generated damage), there is a possibility that impaired processing of AP lesions contributes to the clinical features of XP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>gkz558_Supplemental_File</label><media xlink:href="gkz558_supplemental_file.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ACK1"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors thank Christina Seebode and Janine Lehman (Emmert lab) for making available the XPF KO and the parental MRC-5 Vi cell lines.
