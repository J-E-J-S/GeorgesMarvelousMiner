The generation of a Perfect Match Genomic Landscape (PMGL), which computes intergenome identity with single nucleotide resolution, reveals signatures of variation wherever a query genome differs from a reference genome. Such signatures encode the precise location of different types of variants, including single nucleotide variants, deletions, insertions, and amplifications, effectively introducing the concept of a general signature of variation. The precise nature of variants is then resolved through the generation of targeted alignments between specific sets of sequence reads and known regions of the reference genome. Thus, the perfect match logic decouples the identification of the location of variants from the characterization of their nature, providing a unified framework for the detection of genome variation. We assessed the performance of the PMGL strategy via simulation experiments. We determined the variation profiles of natural genomes and of a synthetic chromosome, both in the context of haploid yeast strains. Our approach uncovered variants that have previously escaped detection. Moreover, our strategy is ideally suited for further refining high-quality reference genomes.

Genome projects typically generate large amounts of sequence reads, which constitute a fragmented and unordered representation of genetic information. Sequence reads are subsequently assembled either <italic>de novo</italic> (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Zerbino and Birney 2008</xref>) or through comparison with the ordered genetic information of a reference genome (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Metzker 2010</xref>). Reference genomes exist for different species, from bacteria (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Blattner <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>) to human (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium 2004</xref>). The central position of reference genomes as platforms for uncovering the nucleotide sequence of related genomes, underscores the importance of their continuous refinement according to conceptual and methodological advances (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Goodwin <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). Genomic studies typically contrast the variation profiles of genomes of interest in a broad set of contexts, ranging from experimental evolution (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Tenaillon <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>) to personalized medicine (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Abrahams and Eck 2016</xref>). The generation of both high-quality reference genomes and precise variation profiles between genomes is therefore of utmost importance.</p><p>Most current algorithms for detecting genome variation are based on mapping sequence reads from the query genome to the reference genome to infer their corresponding locations. The problem of aligning sequence reads to a reference genome is central to genomics (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Pfeifer 2017</xref>), as it is the basis for such procedures as whole genome sequencing (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1000 Genomes Project Consortium 2012</xref>), exome (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Teer and Mullikin 2010</xref>) and transcriptome sequencing (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Park 2009</xref>), among others. A plethora of programs exist to solve this problem computationally (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Mardis 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Goodwin <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). Most methods index the reference genome into highly optimized data structures (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kurtz <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">R. Q. Li <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">H. Li <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Li and Durbin 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chaisson and Tesler 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Langmead and Salzberg 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Holt and McMillan 2014</xref>), generating a variety of specialized algorithms (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Schbath <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). Due to experimental error (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Yang <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>) or true variance between the query genome and the reference genome, most sequence reads do not match exactly with the reference genome. Thus, all aligners ultimately try to solve the &#x0201c;approximate string matching&#x0201d; problem (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Reinert <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>) using some arbitrary measure of &#x0201c;acceptable in-exactness.&#x0201d; The optimal placement of sequence reads is therefore reported in conjunction with some measure of reliability. Consequently, the discovered variants and the resulting query genome sequence are likewise statistical in nature (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">McKenna <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Li 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Koboldt <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Rimmer <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>).</p><p>We have conceptualized the analysis of genome variation from a different perspective, decomposing it into two independent processes. First, finding where the query genome and the reference genome are not identical, and second, revealing the nature of the underlying variants. The precise location of genome sites affected by variation is directly determined from a genome-wide identity landscape, or Perfect Match Genomic Landscape (PMGL). Variant characterization can thus be conducted locally, and solutions can be validated in a qualitative manner. We have previously reported the potential to precisely locate single nucleotide variants by individualizing regions of the reference genome (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Reyes <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>), a step that is incorporated into the PMGL strategy. Most interestingly, a recent study has developed an algorithm that is based on a similar principle to that of the PMGL strategy (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Audano <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>). Their algorithm also reduces the variant search space by first identifying regions that differ between the query genome and the reference genome. In addition to determining the variation profiles of both natural and synthetic query genomes, the non-statistical nature of the PMGL strategy is particularly suited for refining reference genomes. In fact, the PMGL strategy can penetrate both the unique and repeated compartments of a reference genome.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>General protocol for the PMGL pipeline</title><p>The reference genome sequence in fasta format is used to generate a binary database of the reference genome using Bowtie (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Langmead <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), and to generate the ordered set of reference strings (25 mers in this study) that constitute the entire reference genome. The number of exact occurrences of each reference string&#x02019;s sequence in the reference genome database is computed. A Reference Genome Self Landscape (RGSL) is generated by reporting each reference string&#x02019;s unique identifier, number of exact occurrences in the reference genome, sequence, and the unique identifiers of all reference strings sharing the same sequence. The raw query genome sequence reads in fastq format are used to generate a binary database of read string counts (25 mers in this study) computed by Jellyfish (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Mar&#x000e7;ais and Kingsford 2011</xref>). The use of quality-trimmed sequence reads is not necessary (see Supplemental Material, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.117.300589/-/DC1/FileS1.pdf">File S1</ext-link>, Figure S1). A PMGL is generated by reporting the perfect match coverage between the reference genome and the query genome at each reference string along the RGSL. The perfect match coverage is then normalized by the level of repetitiveness of each reference string in the reference genome. Finally, the normalized perfect match coverage at reference string n is divided by the normalized perfect match coverage at reference string n&#x02212;1. The latter corresponds to each reference string&#x02019;s signature value. The PMGL is scanned to localize signatures of variation. A signature of variation is defined as a decrease in the normalized perfect match coverage that generates a trail of 0 or near-zero values terminating at position n&#x02212;1, followed by its immediate recovery at position n. The PMGL scan parameters and their relation to sequencing coverage has been experimentally addressed (Figure S1). Zero-trail signatures of variation are associated with a high signature value at position n. For single nucleotide variants, microindels, and indels, the reference string at position n, or downstream recovery string, corresponds to a perfect match zone that is immediately adjacent to the variation. Its sequence is used to identify the subset of query genome sequence reads that perfectly contain it. The query genome sequence(s) defined by such sequence reads is aligned with the corresponding region of the reference genome using the MUSCLE multiple sequence alignment tool (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Edgar 2004</xref>). The nature of the variant(s) is revealed by an iterative process of alignment interpretation and extension resulting in a single final alignment. Finally, discovered variants are introgressed into the original reference genome sequence to generate a customized reference genome. The disappearance of signatures of variation using the customized reference genome and the original query genome sequence reads as input for the PMGL pipeline validates the precise location and nature of the discovered variants.</p><p>The PMGL pipeline has been fully automated and comprises six computational modules: (1) generation of the RGSL, (2) generation of the PMGL, (3) scanning of the PMGL, (4) generation of the first alignment at each signature of variation, (5) interpretation and extension of alignments, and (6) generation of a customized reference genome.

This may seem counterintuitive, as one would not expect to obtain any information about variation between genomes by focusing precisely on their invariant complement. This apparent paradox, however, can be resolved by constructing a PMGL, which reports the number of perfect matches at each successive position along the reference genome, and interpreting sudden changes in the perfect match coverage as direct indicators of the precise location of variants. Single nucleotide variants, deletions, and insertions cause a depression in the perfect match coverage. Copy number increases such as those generated by amplification cause a rise in the perfect match coverage. Importantly, changes in both directions occur sharply, between two immediately adjacent nucleotides along the reference genome, resulting in signatures of variation with single nucleotide resolution. Scanning the PMGL for signatures of variation determines the precise location of variants along the reference genome. The generation of highly targeted alignments at variation sites resolves their specific nature.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>PMGL pipeline</title><p>A reference strings dataset is used to construct the RGSL structure. In turn, the RGSL and a read strings dataset are used to construct the PMGL structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The reference strings dataset contains the ordered set of overlapping DNA strings, each of size k (25 nucleotides in this work), generated using a one nucleotide sliding window along the reference genome. The RGSL reports each reference string&#x02019;s starting position within a specific chromosome, its nucleotide sequence, the number of occurrences of its sequence in the entire reference genome (count reference), and the unique identifier of all reference strings sharing the same sequence. The RGSL describes the architecture of the reference genome by continuously assessing its degree of repetitiveness. The RGSL structure derived from the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> S288C reference genome contains a total of 12,156,697 reference strings, and 93% of their sequences occur only once in the entire genome. The read strings dataset contains the set of DNA strings, each of size k, generated using a one nucleotide sliding window along all query genome sequence reads. The total number of occurrences of each read string is computed. The PMGL incorporates the RGSL as a structural backbone to report the number of perfect matches between the reference strings and the read strings. The number of perfect matches associated with each reference string is normalized by its count reference.</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Pipeline of the PMGL strategy. (A) Generation of the PMGL. Both the reference genome and the query genome sequence reads are decomposed into comprehensive arrays of k nucleotide-long strings, generating the reference strings dataset and the read strings dataset, respectively.

The detection of a single nucleotide variant illustrates the simple nature of the PMGL strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). A single nucleotide change reduces the perfect match coverage at k successive reference strings, those overlapping with the variant. Within unique regions of a haploid genome, this sharp depression reaches 0 or near-zero values, generating a zero-trail signature of variation. The nucleotide sequence of a reference string immediately adjacent to the signature of variation (recovery string) is used to identify the subset of sequence reads that perfectly contain it. The specific nucleotide change is revealed by generating a local alignment with the corresponding region of the reference genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Detection and characterization of a single nucleotide variant (SNV). Corresponding regions of the query genome (QG) and the reference genome (RG) are represented by a dashed blue line and a solid black line, respectively, and harbor a single nucleotide variant represented by red and black boxes. Reference strings are color-coded: black strings do not include the variant, red strings incorporate the variant, and the purple strings correspond to the upstream recovery string (URS) and the downstream recovery string (DRS). The normalized perfect match coverage (PMnCR), plotted as a solid black line, generates a zero-trail signature of variation. Dark gray and red shading indicate the zero-trail zone. Red shading represents the projection of the variant into the reference genome. Light gray shading spans the reference genome segment used for the alignment. Sequence reads containing both the perfect match zone defined by the recovery strings and the variant are shown. The alignment reveals the nature of the variant at the expected site.

Indeed, the previously described signature persists, and only its shape is modified. A deletion in the query genome results in an increase in the length of the signature corresponding to the size of the deletion. The signature is generated in the presence of any type of insertion because reference strings skip the inserted sequence and do not produce perfect matches with read strings derived from the borders of the insertion. In cases where variants are separated by less than k nucleotides (concatenated variants), their corresponding signatures of variation are merged into a single signature of variation with increased length. Thus, haploid query genomes can be interrogated for the presence of single nucleotide variants, deletions, and insertions using a zero-trail scan along the PMGL (examples are provided in File S2).</p><fig id="fig3" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Detection of different types of variation.

Interestingly, the latter pattern is also present at the starting point of amplifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The detection of amplification sites, however, has not been experimentally addressed here. These sudden changes can be quantified in a genome-wide manner by computing the ratio of normalized perfect matches between successive reference strings, herein referred to as signature value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Single nucleotide variants, deletions, and insertions occurring in unique regions of a haploid query genome or in both the single and repeated compartments of a reference genome (see below) generate a very high signature value at the downstream recovery string.</p><p>More generally, signature values significantly greater than 1 are indicative of variation. Indeed, sharp oscillations in perfect match coverage are not expected to occur between two immediately adjacent nucleotides in the absence of variation. By performing a genome-wide computation of the signature value, and plotting the probability that a site in the genome has a signature value of x, we have confirmed that signature values generate a very narrow distribution centered at 1 (Figure S2), providing a robust baseline for quantitation. In principle, the signature value could be used as a general metric for detecting different types of variation in a variety of contexts (see <italic>Discussion</italic>).</p><p>The PMGL strategy allows a final, qualitative validation of discovered variants.

This altered genome was used to generate an artificial set of query genome sequence reads, and the unaltered S288C reference genome was used to construct the RGSL. The variants introduced included single nucleotide variants, deletions, and insertions; some were concatenated (File S3). Using the zero-trail scan, 103 signatures of variation were found. A big deletion generated more than one signature of variation (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.117.300589/-/DC1/FileS1.pdf">File S1</ext-link>, Scanning of the PMGL). Direct inspection of the PMGL revealed the size and position of big deletions, and the search for artificial sequence reads containing both the downstream and upstream recovery string sequences revealed the breakpoint. In the case of big insertions, the search for artificial sequence reads containing either the downstream or the upstream recovery string sequence revealed the corresponding breakpoint. As expected, all zero-trail signatures of variation were associated with a high signature value at the downstream recovery string. The three altered sites that did not produce a zero-trail signature of variation were contained in repeated regions of the genome (see <italic>Discussion</italic>).</p><p>The simulation experiment described above was then performed introducing varying proportions of single nucleotide errors at random positions in the artificial sequence reads (Table S1). When up to 1% simulated sequencing errors were introduced, only one of the previously detected signatures of variation was lost. For all detected variation sites, the nature of the underlying variants was correctly resolved. At 2 and 3% of introduced errors, 90 and 52% of the original signatures of variation were found, respectively. The decrease in the percentage of signatures of variation recovered at high error rates is mainly due to the decrease in the absolute number of unaltered read strings that can produce perfect matches with the reference genome. In fact, when a twofold increase in the total number of reads was implemented under the 3% errors regime, the percentage of detected signatures of variation increased to 75%. Importantly, at all percentages of introduced errors, no new signatures of variation were generated. Such absence of false positive signals highlights the robustness of the PMGL strategy to sequencing errors.</p><p>We next performed a simulation experiment specifically targeting multiple copy regions of the S288C reference genome. The altered reference genome was used to construct the RGSL, and the unaltered reference genome was used to generate an artificial set of query genome sequence reads. This simulates the presence of discrepancies embedded in the reference genome. Regions of the reference genome present in multiple identical copies were selected. Each variant was introduced into one of the copies of a repeat family. Introduced variants included single nucleotide variants, microdeletions, and microinsertions; in some cases, these variants were concatenated. Using the zero-trail scan, the presence of 109 out of 112 variants was detected exclusively at the exact copy of origin, and their nature was correctly resolved (File S4). Again, no false positive signals were generated.</p><p>For repeated regions of the genome, the generation of signatures of variation is clearly different if the variants are harbored in the query genome or in the reference genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). When harbored in the query genome, the location of the variant remains ambiguous but restricted to a specific position within each copy of the repeated family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Furthermore, a zero-trail signature of variation is not generated, and the variant may only be detected using the signature value metric (see <italic>Discussion</italic>). In contrast, the incorporation of a discrepancy into a specific copy of the reference genome typically renders the affected copy locally unique and unable to attract any read strings. This generates a zero-trail signature of variation accompanied by a high signature value only at the affected copy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In general, the presence of a zero-trail signature of variation within a repeated region directly indicates that no copies from the query genome contain the sequence specified by the reference genome at the corresponding site.</p><fig id="fig5" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Impact on the PMGL for variants present in repeated regions of the query genome or the reference genome. A single nucleotide variant is harbored in a 10-copy region of either (A) the query genome (QG) or (B) the reference genome (RG). Ten copies of the repeated region, located at different positions along the genome, are shown. The query genome is represented in blue and the reference genome in black, highlighting the repeated regions with thick bars. The single nucleotide variant is shown as a red box in one of the copies, and the corresponding sites in the other copies are shown as white boxes. The normalized perfect match coverage (PMnCR) at each copy is plotted as a red line, and its relative scale is presented on the left. The corresponding copy number (CR) is shown as a gray shadow and its scale is presented on the right. SV indicates the relative magnitude of the signature value. When the variant is harbored in the query genome, the number of perfect matches decreases slightly and to the same extent in all of the copies. The signature value increases accordingly. The location of the variant remains ambiguous among the 10 copies (?). When the variant is harbored in one of the copies of the reference genome, a zero-trail signature of variation is typically generated, accompanied by a high signature value specifically at the copy of origin. The remaining copies present a slight increase in the PMnCR because their CR locally decreases by 1. The black rectangle in (A) represents an alternative situation where a single nucleotide variant is located in a two-copy region of the query genome. In this case, the PMnCR decreases to &#x0223c;50% at each copy (broken red line) and the signature value increases to &#x0223c;2 (see <italic>Discussion</italic>). The actual position of the variant remains ambiguous but is now restricted to either of the two copies.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1631fig5"/></fig></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Generation of variation profiles of natural <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genomes</title><p>All natural genomes were analyzed using the automated PMGL pipeline.

Most of the solved signatures of variation are present in both strains, and about half of these are harbored in the repeated compartment of the genome, suggesting that they represent discrepancies introduced into the reference genome sequence of strain S288C (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). A total of 168 individual variants were found, 163 of which were validated by customization.

The latter confirmed the correct incorporation of the first 10 changes, and showed the need to further modify the physical synIII sequence to obtain a more refined reference of the living synIII chromosome. Upon customization of the physical synIII sequence with our newly found variants, all signatures of variation disappeared, thus validating their precise location and nature.</p><p>The as-designed sequence of a synthetic chromosome constitutes the reference genome of the living chromosome. The highest copy number family in current synthetic yeast chromosomes corresponds to the artificially introduced loxPsym sites. These sites are 34 nucleotide long elements derived from phage P1. They allow recombination (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Abremski and Hoess 1985</xref>) and reshuffling of genes (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Dymond <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). SynIII has 198 identical loxPsym sites. To show that the PMGL strategy can unambiguously detect variants embedded in such extremely repeated regions of the reference genome we performed a series of simulation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and File S10). We separately altered 27 copies of the loxPsym site in the as-designed synIII sequence by introducing the same variant, a deletion of the fifth nucleotide. Each altered genome was used to construct the RGSL and the unaltered genome was used to generate an artificial set of query genome sequence reads. For each of the resulting PMGLs, only one of the 198 copies, precisely the one that was altered, produced the zero-trail signature of variation (File S10). In each case, the expected variant was found.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s11"><title>Discussion</title><p>The PMGL strategy for the analysis of genome variation is based on the identification of signatures of variation within an identity landscape. Most interestingly, positional information on variants at the single nucleotide level is obtained prior to the generation of highly targeted alignments between the query genome and the reference genome. Importantly, the PMGL strategy allows the introgression of discovered variants into the initial reference genome sequence, creating a new reference genome over which the perfect match computation should produce a locally uniform landscape. This simple test, which provides a categorical validation for each uncovered variant, is not possible with probability-based programs, which always report a weighted answer.</p><p>This study directly interrogates haploid yeast genomes. Query genomes and reference genomes have been explored using the zero-trail signature of variation while simultaneously determining the signature value at the corresponding variation sites. The precise location of different types of variants has been unambiguously revealed in the unique compartment of query genomes and reference genomes and in the repeated compartment of reference genomes. In fact, both signatures appear simultaneously in these contexts, and the signature value is typically very high. The zero-trail signature of variation, however, cannot detect the presence of amplifications, of variants that occur in multiple copy regions of the query genome, or of heterozygous variants that occur in diploid genomes. In contrast, the signature value can manifest itself in all of these situations. We envision that the signature value could be used as a general signature of variation, potentially driving most types of analyses of sequenced genomes.</p><p>In theory, variants embedded in multiple copy regions of the query genome would produce signature values between two and one, where one is the inferior limit if copies are increased to infinity. Consequently, high-copy regions of the query genome may not be interrogated because the signature value would not deviate significantly from the baseline. The transition to analyzing diploid genomes should be possible, as it should not represent a major conceptual change. What would change significantly is the distribution of signature values at variation sites. In the haploid case, most variation sites generate high signature values. In contrast, for the diploid case, high signature values would be reserved for homozygous variants present in unique regions of the genome. Sites with signature values between two and one would harbor homozygous variants present in repeated regions of the genome or heterozygous variants. It will be important to assess the resolving power of the signature value metric in this context.</p><p>We have tested the performance of the PMGL strategy in a variety of ways, ranging from the determination of variation profiles of simulated query genomes and reference genomes to the genome-wide analyses of natural yeast strains and the targeted analysis of a synthetic yeast chromosome. For these experiments, we have utilized datasets generated with state of the art experimental and bioinformatics methodologies. Most importantly, the PMGL strategy has contributed to the identification of novel variants in these contexts.</p><p>We have shown that high-quality reference genomes can be further refined using the PMGL strategy. Of particular relevance is the possibility to unambiguously detect discrepancies incorporated into the reference genome within identical repeats of any copy number. In most aligners, because query genome to reference genome differences must be tolerated to some extent, all copies from a repeated family compete to attract the same subset of sequence reads. In contrast, in the PMGL strategy, if a reference genome copy harbors any discrepancy that renders it unique, that copy will not attract query genome sequences, generating a signature of variation. This important property of the PMGL strategy could be particularly useful for the challenging task of improving <italic>de novo</italic> genome assemblies, which provide foundational resources for future research in different organisms. In a broader context, any assembled genome, either generated <italic>de novo</italic> or through resequencing, can be conceptualized as a new reference genome and refined with the PMGL strategy, using as query genome the same set of sequence reads utilized for its assembly.</p><p>The development of highly accurate and versatile strategies for analyzing genomes is particularly relevant for the scientific revolution that is already underway: that of expanding our understanding of biology through the synthesis of entire genomes. The Genome Project-write is leading this endeavor (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Boeke <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>), and the Sc2.0 project currently represents the largest genome synthesis initiative (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Richardson <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>). Actually, in addition to synIII (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Annaluru <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>), several synthetic yeast chromosomes have been recently completed: synII (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Shen <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>), synV (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Xie <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>), synVI (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>), synX (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>), and synXII (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>). Confronting designed sequences with their living representations is clearly of utmost importance. We have provided a proof of principle of the power of the PMGL strategy in this context by reanalyzing and refining the reported physical sequence of Sc2.0 synIII.</p><p>The perfect match logic orchestrates simple procedures in such a way that genome variation can be discovered under a different premise: that of an identity landscape containing precise information about variation. We have consolidated this concept in the PMGL pipeline to provide a unified framework for the analysis of sequenced genomes. To reach its maximum potential, this framework should be further developed, notably by exploiting the full potentiality of the signature value metric.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s12"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>Supplemental material is available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.117.300589/-/DC1">www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.117.300589/-/DC1</ext-link>.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><media xlink:href="1631FileS1.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Julio Collado and Daniel Pi&#x000f1;ero for helpful discussions, Delfino Garc&#x000ed;a for technical assistance, Leslie Mitchell for providing the raw whole genome sequence reads from the synIII strain (HMSY011), Eglee Lomelin for assistance with the artwork, the Laboratorio Nacional de Visualizaci&#x000f3;n Cient&#x000ed;fica Avanzada (LAVIS) for providing supercomputer services, and the Instituto Nacional de Medicina Gen&#x000f3;mica (INMEGEN) for performing the Illumina sequence of strains S288C and BY4742.
