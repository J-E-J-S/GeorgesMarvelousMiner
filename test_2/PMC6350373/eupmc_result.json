    "The α-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose is produced in large-scale by strains derived from Actinoplanes sp. SE50 and used widely for the treatment of type-2 diabetes. Compared with the wild-type SE50, a high-yield derivative Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110 shows 2-fold and 3-7-fold improvement of acarbose yield and acb cluster transcription, respectively. The genome of SE50 was fully sequenced and compared with that of SE50/110, and 11 SNVs and 4 InDels, affecting 8 CDSs, were identified in SE50/110. The 8 CDSs were individually inactivated in SE50. Deletions of ACWT_4325 (encoding alcohol dehydrogenase) resulted in increases of acarbose yield by 25% from 1.87 to 2.34 g/L, acetyl-CoA concentration by 52.7%, and PEP concentration by 22.7%. Meanwhile, deletion of ACWT_7629 (encoding elongation factor G) caused improvements of acarbose yield by 36% from 1.87 to 2.54 g/L, transcription of acb cluster, and ppGpp concentration to 2.2 folds. Combined deletions of ACWT_4325 and ACWT_7629 resulted in further improvement of acarbose to 2.83 g/L (i.e. 76% of SE50/110), suggesting that the metabolic perturbation and improved transcription of acb cluster caused by these two mutations contribute substantially to the acarbose overproduction. Enforced application of similar strategies was performed to manipulate SE50/110, resulting in a further increase of acarbose titer from 3.73 to 4.21 g/L. Therefore, the comparative genomics approach combined with functional verification not only revealed the acarbose overproduction mechanisms, but also guided further engineering of its high-yield producers."
