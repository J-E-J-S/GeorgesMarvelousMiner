However, the combination of these mutations has additive effects, hampering SFTB-1 functions and allowing the study of synthetic interactions that may result in a defective spliceosome structure. As a result of an RNAi screen, we identified other proteins of the U2 snRNP complex as targets for synthetic lethality. The <italic>sftb-1</italic> mutant strains also allow the identification of mutations in other splicing factors that are mutually exclusive with <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutations in tumors. <italic>SF3B1</italic> cancer mutations are heterozygous, and interestingly, the most promising therapeutic venue is based on pladienolide B (PB) derivatives that hit the wild-type and the mutated protein.

Somatic heterozygous mutations in <italic>SF3B1</italic> are particularly prevalent in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)&#x02014;up to 80% in refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; and in 15% of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutations have also been reported in solid tumors, including 20% of uveal melanomas (UM) [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], 3% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and 1.8% of breast cancers [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses in different tumor types and cell lines with <italic>SF3B1</italic> missense mutations, including the most prevalent substitution K700E, identified distinct alternative splicing (AS) defects [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Recently, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has allowed researchers to faithfully reproduce human pathological mutations in animal models. Human <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutations have been introduced in cell lines [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], but mimicking these mutations in multicellular organisms has only been achieved by conditional alleles in murine models [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Taking advantage of the extraordinary conservation of splicing factors across evolution and the ease of genetic manipulation of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, we established a multicellular model to study <italic>SF3B1</italic> cancer-related mutations. Spliceosome components, and particularly <italic>SF3B1</italic>, are being intensively studied as targets of antitumor drugs [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Some natural compounds modulate splicing by targeting SF3B1. Among them, pladienolide B is particularly relevant because H3B-8800, a PB derivative, has antitumoral effects and is in clinical trials [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The modulatory activity of PB is highly dependent on SF3B1 structure, and single amino acid substitutions cause resistance to PB [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Hence, particular residues in the drug binding site that are not conserved in SFTB-1 may confer resistance to PB in worms, as it has been recently observed in yeast [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We edited four amino acids to humanize the HEAT repeat 15 in SFTB-1, making <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> sensitive to splicing modulators. Thus, we have created the first <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> strain sensitive to PB and HB, which would facilitate the chemical modulation of splicing in this model system.</p><p>Altogether, the multicellular model of <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutations described in this study provides a new pre-clinical platform for identifying new targets and small molecules for use in cancer therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title><italic>sftb-1</italic>, the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> ortholog of <italic>SF3B1</italic>, is a ubiquitously expressed gene essential for development</title><p>The <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> protein SFTB-1 is 66% identical to human SF3B1 in terms of amino acid composition.

They are particularly recurrent in MDS or UM, which commonly lack effective therapeutic approaches. In this study, we establish the first multicellular model for <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutations expressed non-conditionally from the endogenous locus. The rapid <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> life cycle (three days at 25&#x000b0;C) and the around 300 self-progeny obtained from a single hermaphrodite, among other features, make this model organism ideal for large-scale genetic and drug screens. The task of modeling human pathological mutations has been facilitated by the advent of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technique, which has been efficiently implemented in this nematode [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>As expected for a core splicing factor, and as previously reported in zebrafish [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and mice [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans SF3B1</italic> ortholog is essential for development.

However, homozygous <italic>sftb-1</italic> missense mutations are viable in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, although they generate defects that are unmasked when additional alterations in the spliceosome are introduced. Such a feature is advantageous for investigating vulnerabilities of <italic>SF3B1</italic>-mutated tumors, which are not only conferred by missense mutations, but also by the loss of one <italic>SF3B1</italic> WT copy [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>Differently from MDS with <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutations, where aberrant transcripts have been directly related to phenotypic traits [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], transcripts affected by <italic>sftb-1</italic>[K718E] do not produce any obvious phenotypes. Still, <italic>Sf3b1</italic><sup>K700E/+</sup> murine models only partially recapitulate the hematopoietic phenotype characteristic of MDS [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and CLL [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], although a modest overlap in aberrant splicing events between <italic>Sf3b1</italic><sup>K700E/+</sup> mice and MDS patients with <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutations was detected [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>RNA-seq of <italic>sftb-1</italic>[K718E] animals did not identify the aberrant use of alternative 3&#x02019; splice sites (A3&#x02019;SS) as the predominant splicing defect caused by this mutation, as has been observed in human cells [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Indeed, in three distinct <italic>sftb-1</italic> mutants, we found a mild effect on AS, with SE being the most abundant splicing defect. Such disparity in the consequences of the K700E mutation between humans and nematodes may be explained by different factors. First, diverse computational pipelines have been used to assess differences in alternative splicing between WT and <italic>SF3B1</italic>-mutated samples, resulting in distinct conclusions. For instance, <italic>Liberante</italic> and coworkers reanalyzed previously published data and found that <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutation was mostly associated with differential skipped exon events, rather than A3&#x02019;SS selection [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Second, intronic elements directing splicing have evolved differently in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> compared to other organisms. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> introns are typically shorter, do not have a consensus branch site (BS) sequence, and the vertebrate polypyrimidine (Py) tract is replaced by the consensus UUUUCAG/R sequence [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Third, only ~35% of genes are alternatively spliced in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] compared to 95% in humans [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Fourth, cell type-specific alternative isoforms generated by <italic>sftb-1</italic> mutations could have been underrepresented in our analyses as we sequenced the transcriptome of whole animals, and A3&#x02019;SS selection can be regulated in a tissue-specific manner in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. And fifth, the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) system could efficiently eliminate transcripts with A3&#x02019;SS resulting from <italic>sftb-1</italic> mutations, as occurs in human cells [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, we did not detect predominance of downregulation among the differentially expressed transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008464.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>).</p><p>Beyond its action on A3&#x02019;SS usage, <italic>SF3B1</italic> missense mutations could have an impact on the structure, the interaction with other proteins in the spliceosome, or the robustness of the protein. In fact, the PB derivative H3B-8800, which induces lethality in spliceosome-mutant cancers by modulating the SF3B complex, affects AS activity similarly in WT and in <italic>SF3B1</italic><sup>K700E</sup> human cells [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, <italic>SF3B1</italic>-mutated cells present vulnerabilities that can be exploited in synthetic lethal screens. We found that <italic>sftb-1</italic> mutants are sensitive to RNAi of different splicing factors, including itself, and we further validated these synthetic interactions with the inactivation of other components of the U2 snRNP. These results point to other components of the spliceosome as targets to preferentially kill cells with deficiencies in SF3B1 activity. Knowing the suitability of <italic>sftb-1</italic> mutants for RNAi screens, the collection of RNAi clones to be tested should be expanded, with particular interest placed on deubiquitinases and chromatin factors that have been related to SF3B1 functions [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>Pladienolide and related compounds have been proven to be effective in selectively killing cells with <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutations [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. We tested pladienolide B and sudemycin D6 in WT animals and <italic>sftb-1</italic> cancer-related mutants but did not observe any effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008464.s011">S4 Table</xref>). The modulatory activity of these drugs is highly dependent on the protein structure, as evidenced by the fact that missense mutations in <italic>SF3B1</italic> confer resistance to the drugs [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. By modifying four amino acids, we reproduced the human HEAT repeat 15 in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> SFTB-1. As a result, worms became sensitive to pladienolide B and herboxidiene but maintained resistance to sudemycin D6. Further humanization of SFTB-1 and other SF3B complex components would likely increase the sensitivity to these drugs and expand the number of known splicing modulators effective in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. As an example, while PHF5A is highly conserved in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, the Y36 position, which confers resistance to PB, HB, and sudemycin D6 when mutated [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], corresponds to a histidine. Thus, the H36Y substitution in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> might increase sensitivity to splicing modulators.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that this is the first report of an invertebrate animal model sensitive to PB and HB. Previously, splicing inhibition by PB <italic>in vivo</italic> was reported in yeast strains that were edited to humanize some Hsh155 HEAT repeats and mutated to block PB efflux [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As an added value to the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> toolkit, we have generated a strain that presents WT characteristics but is sensitive to splicing modulators such as PB and HB, which we believe has great potential for splicing-related studies in this nematode.</p><p><italic>SF3B1</italic> mutations are mutually exclusive with other splicing factor mutations present in tumors. <italic>U2AF1</italic> and <italic>SRSF2</italic> missense mutations are reported in 11% and 12&#x02013;15% of MDS, respectively [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and very rarely overlap with <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutations, which are present in 17&#x02013;28% of MDS patients [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Hence, cells may not handle all the AS defects produced by the combination of mutations in any of these three proteins. To further validate our model as a tool for identifying vulnerabilities in cells with compromised SF3B1 function, we mimicked <italic>U2AF1</italic><sup>S34F</sup> and <italic>SRSF2</italic><sup>P95H</sup> mutations in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> and detected a functional interaction between both mutants and the <italic>sftb-1</italic>[Q552P, R643C, K718E] allele. Additionally, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans rsp-4</italic> and <italic>uaf-2</italic> missense mutations could be used for RNA-seq analyses and RNAi screens to study the consequences and vulnerabilities of these mutations, respectively.</p><p>We have demonstrated that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> can be a valuable model to explore vulnerabilities of cells with mutations in <italic>SF3B1</italic>, although the molecular consequences of <italic>sftb-1</italic> mutations were different from the ones observed in other organisms. Replacement of several HEAT repeats in yeast Hsh155 with their human counterparts is functional and supports splicing [<xref rid="pgen.1008464.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].

The studies are novel and experiments are well performed. Nonetheless, the addition of a few experiments aimed at getting deeper into mechanistic basis for some of the associations shown would help the manuscript. In addition, there are some improper references and citations that should be corrected as noted below:</p><p>-What is the basis for the synthetic lethal effects of mutations in SF3B1 and U2AF1/SRSF2 found here? While this synthetic lethal interaction has been shown in mice, identifying a molecular basis for this interaction was challenging and not very clear.</p><p>-Why are the humanized SF3B1 mutant worms sensitive to Pladienolide B but insensitive to Sudemycin D6? These compounds physically interact with several components of the SF3b complex (not just SF3B1). For example, several amino acid residues in PHF5A are required for drug binding to Pladienolide B. It would be important to note whether these proteins are conserved in sequence between C. elegans and humans.</p><p>-What are the effects of mutations in U2AF1S34P and SRSF2P95H on splicing? These mutations have been reported to impact splicing based on exonic sequences and/or sequences at the 3&#x02019; splice site (genomic regions which may be more conserved across species).</p><p>-In the Abstract, the following points should be corrected:</p><p>---SF3B1 mutations have not been shown to impart a growth advantage on their own. In fact, in most studies introduction of mutant SF3B1 actually imparts a growth disadvantage to human and mouse cells. This point alone has been a conundrum related to the study of these mutations.</p><p>---Cancer-associated SF3B1 mutations have not been shown to be deleterious when made homozygous in any animal models to date. This has been shown for SRSF2 however (Lee et al. Nature Medice 2016; PMCID PMC4899191). This paper would be important to cite here. SF3B1 mutations have been shown to be lethal when made hemizygous (with ablation of the wild-type allele in the presence of the mutant allele; Zhou et al. A chemical genetics approach for the functional assessment of novel cancer genes. Cancer Research 2015). This paper should also be cited.</p><p>-In the Author Summary, the following points should be corrected:</p><p>---The phrase &#x0201c;visual phenotype&#x0201d; should be edited to be more precise. I believe the authors mean &#x0201c;overt&#x0201d; phenotype (as opposed to a phenotype related to vision) but this needs to be clearly stated.</p><p>---The term &#x0201c;slight&#x0201d; when referencing alterations in splicing should be deleted. First, the splicing of one essential gene in a deleterious way can have massive effect on cells/organisms so the phrase &#x0201c;slight&#x0201d; is not appropriate.</p><p>---Pladienolide B binds to both wild-type SF3B1 protein as well as cancer-associated SF3B1 mutants. Thus, the phrase &#x0201c;hit the wild-type copy&#x0201d; is not appropriate (&#x0201c;copy&#x0201d; also suggests the genomic allele and not the protein).</p><p>-The comment in the Discussion about effects of SF3B1 K700E mutations on splicing in mouse versus human cells should note the findings from Lee et al. 2018 reference cited here where a much greater overlap in aberrant splicing events between mouse and human SF3B1 K700E mutant cells was identified than in Obeng et al. or Mupo et. al papers listed (Obeng &#x00026; Mupo et al. studies missed some very clearly overlapping splicing events across mouse &#x00026; human SF3B1 K700E mutant cells).</p><p>Reviewer #2: In this manuscript, Serrat and colleagues design a series of transgenic C. elegans animals carrying cancer-associated mutations in several orthologs of splicing factor genes. The majority of the paper focuses on mutations in sftb-1, the worm ortholog of SF3B1, but they also study mutations introduced in uaf-2/U2AF1 and rsp-4/SRSF2, two additional splicing regulators. The authors have used these transgenic animals to look at phenotypes associated with these cancer-associated mutations. They demonstrate that although individual mutations in sftb-1 do not have dramatic phenotypic effects (unlike in humans), combining several mutations at the same locus do have pronounced effects on animal health and physiology. The authors then explore transcriptome changes in several of these mutant strains by RNA-seq analysis, and find that splicing patterns and gene expression patterns differ between mutants, with severity of phenotype correlating with the extent of transcriptome alterations. Next, the authors perform a focused RNAi screen to look at genetic interactions between alleles of sftb-1 and other splicing related factors, and identify 27 candidate modifier genes and validate one of these interactions with a partial loss of function allele. The authors extend their analysis of genetic interactions by making double mutant animals with other splicing factor genes containing cancer-associated mutations (sftb-1; uaf-2 and sftb-1; rsp-4), and find synthetic interactions between these alleles as well. Finally, the authors also test the responsiveness of a partially humanized version of sftb-1 to pladienolide B, and demonstrate that these transgenic animals display a dose-sensitive phenotype.</p><p>Overall, I found that this manuscript has several very interesting results and conceptual advances, including the establishment of a worm strain where splicing can be modulated by a chemical. Although the authors do not delve deeper into any of the interesting genetic interactions uncovered or further pursue experiments related to their humanized sftb-1 mutant that responds to PB, the work presented will pave the way towards additional interesting lines of inquiry. As such I think the work is suitable for publication, but it would be nice to have more clarification/additional data included to strengthen a few points:</p><p>1) In the RNAi screen, it appears that among the 27 hits, the authors score an interaction as more severe relative to a sibling matched wild type from their outcrossing experiments (Table S3). While I appreciate that the authors are trying to use matched sibling wild type strains to account for background effects, the differences in the phenotypes scored for the wild type strains (CER221, CER237, and CER239) can be somewhat variable between experiments. This variability leads to some concerns that there may be variability in the depletion of the genes targeted by RNAi from experiment to experiment rather than variability due to background genetic modifiers (I would be very surprised to see this much variability due to off-target effects due to CRISPR editing for example).</p><p>Minimally, it would be nice to see more information on the details of the RNAi screens:</p><p>-How many technical/biological replicates were scored</p><p>-Were phenotypes called by different individuals or the same individual</p><p>-Were all experiments performed together (i.e same batch of plates / RNAi bacteria) or were different control strains tested on different days?</p><p>This information would give the reader a bit more clarity in terms of how much confidence to place in some of the preliminary RNAi screen data. It is nice that the teg-4 example validates well by additional genetic analysis.</p><p>2) For the transcriptome analysis, it would be nice to know the overlap between the transcriptome changes detected in the different mutants? Either there is a lot of overlap suggesting that the mutations lead to similar effects on sftb-1 activity, or there is not so much overlap suggesting that different mutations have different consequences. Either result is interesting. Perhaps a Venn Diagram or a heatmap would give the reader a better idea of the extent of overlap between targets and direction of change.</p><p>3) Are the target transcripts affected by these sftb-1 mutations enriched in any functional categories? Have the authors performed a GO analysis? It would be interesting to hear the results of such an analysis.</p><p>Reviewer #3: The manuscript by Serrat et al. entitled &#x0201c;CRISPR editing of sftb1/SF3B1 in C. elegans allows the identification of synthetic interactions with cancer-related mutations and the chemical inhibition of splicing.&#x0201d; describes the generation and characterization of novel C.elegans mutants in the splicing factor sftb1/SF3B1. The authors describe synthetic lethal interplay between disease-associated sftb1 alleles and mutations in other splicing factors. Moreover, they show that humanizing C.elegans sftb1 sensitizes mutant worms to treatment with the splicing modulator Pladienolide B. Consistent with work in human and murine cells, the authors demonstrate that the disease-associated sftb1 alleles are more sensitive to Pladienolide B treatment. Together, the paper demonstrates the utility of these new animal models to identify novel synthetic lethal interaction with sftb1 mutations. Overall the experiments are sound and well controlled, but a few points need additional clarification.</p><p>1. The authors state that the sftb1 loss-of-function mutants are viable until larval stages due to residual maternal contributed wild-type product. Please include quantification of this residual maternal material through embryonic and early larval stages. It is important to understand the requirement for wild-type sftb1 for survival.</p><p>2. Knockdown of sftb1 was shown to be synthetic lethal with sftb1 (Q55P, R643C, K718E) mutants. Studies in murine models of other splicing factors suggest that cells heterozygous with null alleles are less affected than those heterozygous with disease-associated alleles. It would be of value to the community to know if this is also true for SF3B1. The genetic interactions should also be performed with sftb1 null/wild type worms.</p><p>3. There are similar types of splicing changes in the various sftb1 mutants, but are the same transcripts/genes affected. Quantify the overlap of the exact splicing changes across the RNA-seq datasets and add 1-2 sentences commenting on the overlaps.</p><p>4. Out of the 104 RNAi clones tested, 27 showed a synthetic interaction with the sftb1 mutants. Is there anything special about the 27 compared to the 104? Do they act as a specific step of the splicing cycle? Are they enriched for SF3B1-interacting proteins? Please add 1-2 sentences commenting on the hits.</p><p>5. RNAi for teg4 is the strongest interactor with the sftb1 mutants, but it also shows major lethality in wild types. Add a sentence clarifying the effect is not overly selective to the sftb1 mutants.</p><p>6. By mutating four amino acids in sftb1, the authors were able to sensitize worms to pladienolide B but not sudemycin D6. Please add a sentence to the results or discussion commenting on the different binding sites for PB and sudemycin within SF3B1 that imparted this specificity.</p><p>**********</p><p><bold>Have all data underlying the figures and results presented in the manuscript been provided?</bold></p><p>Large-scale datasets should be made available via a public repository as described in the <italic>PLOS Genetics</italic>
