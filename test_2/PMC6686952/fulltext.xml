Crystal structure analyses show that CBG contains a single hydrophobic steroid-binding site (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) that is predominantly occupied by cortisol in human plasma (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Human CBG is also known as SERPINA6 and shares structural similarity with several SERPINA family members (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) that inhibit specific proteases by ensnaring them after proteolysis of an exposed reactive center loop (RCL), which is a structural characteristic of SERPINs (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). While CBG does not inhibit proteases, its RCL is cleaved by neutrophil elastase (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), chymotrypsin (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and the bacterial protease, LasB (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). This causes a conformational change in CBG with the insertion of the amino-terminal portion of the cleaved RCL as a novel &#x000df;-strand, and this disrupts its ability to bind steroids with high affinity (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Neutrophil elastase cleavage of the RCL of human CBG is thought to increase the amounts of anti-inflammatory steroids that are not protein-bound at sites of inflammation, infection or tissue damage (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>Human CBG contains six sites for <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation in the mature polypeptide sequence (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), which are partly occupied by an ensemble of complex carbohydrates (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) that contribute to its electrophoretic heterogeneity (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Importantly, <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation at N347 within the RCL of human CBG modulates how efficiently proteases cleave the RCL (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and evidence that the type of <italic>N</italic>-glycan at N238 in human CBG influences its steroid-binding properties suggests that this oligosaccharide interacts with amino acid residues as the nascent glycoprotein is modified in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi during synthesis (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In addition to protecting CBG against proteolysis and influencing steroid binding, the <italic>N</italic>-glycans may limit its recognition by monoclonal antibodies through steric hindrance or altered epitope conformation. This is important given the frequency of <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation abnormalities associated with disease (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>ELISAs have been developed for human CBG measurements in biological fluids utilizing monoclonal antibodies that recognize specific epitopes on the surface of the natively folded glycoprotein (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Plasma CBG levels measured by one of these ELISAs, which uses a monoclonal antibody (12G2) against an epitope that is unperturbed by structural changes caused by RCL proteolysis (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), correlate well with measurements of CBG concentrations based on its steroid-binding capacity (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, plasma CBG levels determined using these two different assay methodologies do not always correspond with those obtained by an ELISA that uses a monoclonal antibody (9G12) raised against a synthetic RCL polypeptide. This has led to the proposition that low-affinity forms of CBG exist in blood from some individuals as a result of RCL proteolysis (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). We recently questioned this assumption and demonstrated that low-affinity forms of CBG with a cleaved RCL are undetectable in human blood samples under normal or pathological conditions (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Building on the biochemical analyses in the latter report, we now present evidence that discrepancies in these ELISA measurements of plasma CBG reflect abnormalities in CBG <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation rather than a disruption in the epitope within the RCL upon its proteolysis by neutrophil elastase.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec><title>Human subjects</title><p>Plasma from healthy individuals in whom plasma CBG measurements were either concordant or discrepant in ELISA measurements (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) were used as controls for CBG assays or desialylation experiments. Anonymized plasma samples from patients (IRB 16-004682-06) with CDG were used for CBG measurements. Patient demographics and their biochemical and genetic characteristics are in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Patients with CDG type I have a genetic defect involving the endoplasmic reticulum (PMM2-CDG), while patients with CDG type II have a disorder affecting the Golgi apparatus (TMEM165-CDG and ATP6V0A2-CDG). Patients with PGM1-CDG showed a combined defect (mixed type I and II type CDG). Patients B, D, E and H carried homozygous mutations.

In addition to the CBG N238&#x02009;+&#x02009;N347, CBG T349A and CBG A256T mutants used in previous studies (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), two other <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation-deficient human CBGs, CBG N347D and CBG N238&#x02009;+&#x02009;T349A, were prepared using the QuikChange II kit (Agilent). The CBG N347D mutant was generated using a pRc/CMV expression vector containing the WT CBG cDNA (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) as the template, with a mutagenic oligonucleotide 5&#x02032;ACCCTAgACCTGACGTCCAAGCCTTC (mutated nucleotide in lower case). In contrast, the CBG N238&#x02009;+&#x02009;T349A mutant was produced from a pRc/CMV plasmid encoding CBG N238 (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) with 5&#x02032;-GGGGTCACCCTAAACCTGgCGTCCAAGCCTATCATC TTGC (mutated nucleotide in lower case). Mutated CBG cDNA sequences were verified prior to transfection of CHO-S cells (Gibco #11619-012) or CHO mutant lines, Lec1 (ATCC CRL-1735) or Lec2 (ATCC CRL-1736), for recombinant protein expression (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). As previously observed (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), variability in the expression of CBG constructs in CHO cell lines is likely due to differences in the proportion of stably transfected cells expressing the cDNA constructs rather than issues with synthesis of the mutants.<fig fig-type="figure" id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Positions of <italic>N</italic>-glycans attached to human CBG and the CBG<italic> N</italic>-glycosylation mutants investigated, the CBG reactive center loop (RCL) sequence and 9G12 monoclonal antibody epitope.

</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements of CBG</title><p>A radioligand saturation method (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) was used to measure the steroid-binding capacity of CBG in plasma, culture medium or in samples after steroid-affinity purification. This steroid-BCA only detects and measures CBG molecules that bind steroids with high affinity in biological samples and does not detect CBG after proteolytic cleavage of the RCL because this causes a ~10-fold reduction in steroid-binding affinity (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Briefly, samples were diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and steroids were removed by incubation with dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) followed by centrifugation. Samples (100&#x02009;&#x000b5;L) of the supernatants were then incubated with ~10&#x02009;nM [<sup>3</sup>H]-corticosterone (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1&#x02009;h at room temperature (RT) and 30&#x02009;min at 4&#x000b0;C in the absence or presence of a 200-fold excess of corticosterone to monitor non-specific binding. After separation of free steroids by adsorption with DCC at 0&#x000b0;C for 10&#x02009;min followed by centrifugation, CBG-bound [<sup>3</sup>H]-corticosterone in the supernatants was measured in a scintillation spectrophotometer. A modification of this protocol was used for Scatchard analysis to determine steroid-binding affinity constants (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>The CBG levels in plasma and cell culture media were also determined by two ELISAs using the same immobilized rabbit anti-human CBG polyclonal antibody (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and two different murine monoclonal antibodies for detection: 12G2, which recognizes a surface epitope of CBG that includes A256 (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and 9G12, which was raised against a synthetic polypeptide (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) that spans the neutrophil elastase cleavage site between V344 and T345 in the RCL of CBG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Serum with a known CBG concentration determined by BCA was used to prepare ELISA standard curves.

After 1.5&#x02009;h, 15&#x02009;&#x000b5;L were removed from the incubation and frozen, while the remainder frozen after 18-h digestion. Sialidase A (Prozyme, Hayward, CA, USA) was used to desialylate CBG in plasma samples to determine how terminal sialic acid residues influence ELISA measurements of CBG. Desialylation was performed using 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;L of plasma (1:10 in PBS) incubated (2&#x02009;h at 37&#x000b0;C) with 10&#x02009;mU sialidase A in 20&#x02009;&#x000b5;L.

For this purpose, polyclonal anti-CBG IgG was purified by DEAE-Sephadex A50 chromatography using 10&#x02009;mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, while the monoclonal antibodies were purified by Protein A agarose chromatography (Affi-Gel, Bio-Rad Laboratories). The columns were equilibrated with wash buffer (20&#x02009;mM HEPES in 100&#x02009;mM NaCl, pH 7.4) using gravity flow.

This threonine lies just outside the epitope recognized by the 9G12 antibody (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Thus, while the T349A substitution disrupts the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sequon in the RCL, it does so without altering the sequence of the 9G12 epitope that contains N347 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). This was important because CBG N347D is undetectable in a 9G12 ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In the latter experiment, we also included a CBG mutant (A256T) that is not recognized in the 12G2 ELISA (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The Ala256 is located on the surface of human CBG in a position far from the RCL and this explains why the CBG A256T mutant is recognized appropriately in the 9G12 ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Moreover, a synthetic peptide in which the asparagine (N347) resides within the 9G12 epitope is substituted with aspartic acid failed to interact with 9G12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Intriguingly, prolonged PNGase F treatment of native CBG, which removes most of the <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans as evidenced by its increased electrophoretic mobility, resulted in comparable signals with the 9G12 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref>). This suggests that the <italic>N</italic>-glycan at N347 was not removed as it would have caused deamidation of N347 and loss of 9G12 recognition, and explains why plasma samples with discrepant CBG values in a 9G12 ELISA were previously unaffected by PNGase F treatment (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).<fig fig-type="figure" id="fig2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>N347 is a key recognition amino acid in the epitope for the RCL monoclonal antibody 9G12.

Western blot analysis demonstrated that the WT CBG and CBG mutants were produced by all three CHO cell lines with electrophoretic mobilities that reflect the expected number of <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites. In the media from all three CHO cell lines, the CBG N238&#x02009;+&#x02009;N347 mutant was more heterogeneous in terms of its electrophoretic isoforms when compared with the CBG N238&#x02009;+&#x02009;T349A mutant, and this was most apparent when comparing these mutant proteins produced by Lec1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>). In the latter case, a doublet was observed for the CBG N238&#x02009;+&#x02009;N347 mutant: one component of which has an electrophoretic mobility similar to the single band observed for the CBG N238&#x02009;+&#x02009;T349A mutant with only one<italic> N</italic>-glycosylation site. Although amino acid substitutions can alter the mobility of CBG during SDS-PAGE (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), this suggests that one of the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites in CBG N238&#x02009;+&#x02009;N347 is not utilized. Remarkably, CBG N238&#x02009;+&#x02009;T349A expressed in CHO-S and Lec1 CHO cells bound steroid normally, but lacked steroid-binding when expressed in Lec2 CHO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to our ELISA measurements of CBG in plasma samples (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), the amounts of WT CBG produced by all three CHO cell lines were always greater when measured by the 9G12 ELISA than by the 12G2 ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>). This discrepancy was similarly observed in ELISAs of the CBG mutant with <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites only at N238 and N347 (CBG N238&#x02009;+&#x02009;N347), but it was enhanced in the CBG T349A mutant lacking an <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation site within the RCL, as well as in the CBG N238&#x02009;+&#x02009;T349A mutant carrying only the <italic>N</italic>-glycan required for high-affinity steroid-binding without the RCL <italic>N</italic>-glycan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>).

The largest such increase occurred in samples in which the original ELISA values were concordant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>) and is attributed to qualitative and quantitative differences in glycosylation at N347.

For these analyses we used a reference sample (C1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>) in which the 12G2 ELISA and BCA measurements were concordant, while 9G12 ELISA values were much lower than the 12G2 ELISA or BCA measurements (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). To accomplish this, Western blotting was first used to assess the relative abundance and electrophoretic properties of CBG in the patient plasma samples (A&#x02013;H) as compared to the control (C1). The CBG in most of the CDG patient samples displayed a degree of electrophoretic heterogeneity similar to that observed for CBG in healthy individuals (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), for example, in the C1 sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>). However, the plasma CBG in some patients (C, G and H in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>) was characterized by multiple isoforms of lower apparent molecular weight than the major ~60&#x02009;kDa glycoforms observed in C1, consistent with quantitative or qualitative abnormalities in <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation.

The large number of CBG electrophoretic isoforms in the plasma of Patient G was particularly interesting, as the major ~60&#x02009;kDa CBG bands in the control (C1) and other CDG patient samples were absent in this sample. By Scatchard analyses, the affinities of CBG for corticosterone in CDG patient plasma samples (expressed as Kd values in nM), were similar to that in C1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>).<fig fig-type="figure" id="fig6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>ELISA measurements of plasma CBG are affected by aberrant glycosylation in CDG patients.

As in C1, the 9G12 ELISA values were lower than the BCA values in plasma samples from some CDG patients (A, B, D, E and F) suggesting a reduced 9G12 epitope recognition of CBG in these samples. In the two Type 1 CDG patients (C and G), and the patient with a mixed Type 1 and Type 2 CDG (H), the 12G2 ELISA measurements of CBG exceeded the BCA values and their 9G12 ELISA values were either similar to or much higher than the BCA values.

Moreover, the 9G12 ELISA values of CBG were generally higher when compared to the BCA values for the purified CBG from patient samples and again this was greatly accentuated in the case of Patient G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We set out to determine why 9G12 ELISA measurements of CBG in healthy individuals (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and in some patients with sepsis (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) or various other diseases (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) are lower than corresponding 12G2 ELISA or BCA measurements (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The fact that the 9G12 epitope within the RCL of human CBG contains the N347 glycosylation site that is not always fully utilized (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and is positioned only two residues C-terminal of the neutrophil elastase cleavage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>), suggested that this might modify the way the 9G12 antibody recognizes the RCL. To test this, we used different approaches to prevent or alter the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation at N347 in the RCL. As hypothesized, our experiments demonstrate that CBG without an <italic>N</italic>-glycan in this position is recognized more effectively by the 9G12 monoclonal and that the ability of this antibody to recognize its epitope is influenced by the complexity of the attached<italic> N</italic>-glycan. Establishing this molecular relationship cautions against drawing conclusions about the structural or functional properties of a protein analyte based on immunoassays that rely on a monoclonal antibody as the detection reagent. This is not without precedent, as glycosylation alters the recognition of epitopes by monoclonal antibodies in ELISAs of other glycoproteins, including MUC2 mucin (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) and the vitamin D-binding protein (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>Unexpectedly, we also observed that disruption of the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sequon (NLT) within the RCL by a threonine-to-alanine substitution results in a complete loss of steroid-binding activity when the mutant proteins were expressed in Lec2 CHO cells and that this occurred even in a mutant (CBG N238&#x02009;+&#x02009;T349A) that is only<italic> N</italic>-glycosylated at N238.

It is therefore remarkable that mutation of T349, which has the same effect, has such a detrimental effect on steroid binding because it lies within the exposed RCL and is unlikely to interact with amino acid residues within the steroid-binding site. Since this effect was not observed when the CBG T349A mutant was expressed in CHO-S cells or Lec1 cells that produce less complex <italic>N</italic>-glycan structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>) or when the N347 in the RCL is mutated to disrupt the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation site (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) we are left with the possibility that structural differences in the oligosaccharide additions to N238 affect the steroid-binding activity of CBG through interactions with Thr349 or some other structural component of the RCL. Crystal structure and modeling of oligosaccharide chains attached to the glycosylation sites of rat CBG, which correspond to N238 and N347 in human CBG, predict that these <italic>N</italic>-glycans are in close proximity to each other (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). This might suggest that glycan&#x02013;glycan interactions influence the folding of the protein during its synthesis and its acquisition of a high-affinity steroid-binding site, but this is unlikely because the latter only requires <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation at N238 (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Nevertheless, these observations stress the importance of considering the structures and molecular interactions of the carbohydrates decorating CBG when exploring the structure/function relationship(s) of this glycoprotein.</p><p>Our analyses of plasma CBG levels in patients diagnosed with CDGs are informative in several ways that may be diagnostically important. This is because &#x0003e;150 different types of CDG have been identified (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) that involve mutations in genes that are key components of the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation machinery including <italic>PMM2</italic>, <italic>PGM1</italic>, <italic>TMEM165</italic> and <italic>ATP6V0A2</italic>. Although many of these mutations are rare, &#x0003e;980 PMM2-CDG cases have been reported, and the disease frequency is estimated to be 1:100,000 (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Moreover, some of these patients have an R141H substitution in phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2) that is relatively common, with a carrier frequency of 1/79 in Dutch/Flemish and 1/60 in Danish populations, respectively (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). It is not clear how the efficiency of <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation in the liver is affected in heterozygous carriers of these mutations, but this may in part explain the discrepancies in ELISA measurements of plasma CBG in other patient groups as well as in cohorts of healthy individuals, as mentioned above.</p><p>Our CDG patient group included very severely affected patients with pathogenic nonsense variants in <italic>PMM2</italic>, <italic>PGM1</italic> or <italic>ATP6V0A2</italic>, as well as a patient who was homozygous for a deep intronic pathogenic variant in <italic>TMEM165</italic> (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The two PMM2-CDG patients are compound heterozygous for severe pathogenic missense variants (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), including one patient (Patient C) who was heterozygous for two common PMM2 variants (C241S and R141H). It is therefore interesting that the electrophoretic heterogeneity of plasma CBG in these two patients is much more exaggerated than in other patients, with the exception of Patient H who is homozygous for a rare mutation that causes an S338R substitution in phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1). There is no information about the biochemical consequences of this particular PGM1 mutation but our Western blotting experiment indicates that it disrupts the glycosylation of plasma CBG profoundly. Moreover, the ELISA values of plasma CBG in Patient H were either similar to or higher than the BCA measurements. By contrast, the CBG glycoform profile in plasma from Patient D was only marginally different from that in the control sample, and the ELISA values showed the same type of discrepancy as in the reference sample. This is interesting because Patient D is homozygous for the more common R515Q substitution that occurs within the substrate-binding loop of PGM1, which is known to influence the catalytic activity of this enzyme (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Although the biochemical consequences of this particular mutation are not well understood, our data suggest that the <italic>PGM1</italic> R515Q variant is less detrimental than the <italic>PGM1</italic> S338R variant at least in terms of the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation of proteins like CBG that are produced by the liver.</p><p>Plasma CBG levels determined by ELISAs in some CDG patients were higher than their corresponding BCA values, especially when the 12G2 monoclonal antibody was used. This was unexpected because BCA and 12G2 ELISA measurements of CBG displayed a high degree of correspondence in healthy individuals and acutely ill patients in our previous studies (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). We therefore conclude that the abnormal <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation of CBG in CDG patients either allows the protein to be more efficiently recognized by the monoclonal antibodies or that some CBG glycoforms bind steroid with abnormally low affinity, which is a possibility because the presence and composition of <italic>N</italic>-glycans at specific locations on the CBG molecule influence its steroid-binding properties (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Interestingly, our data suggest that the <italic>N</italic>-glycan at N238 interacts with residues in the RCL region to influence the steroid-binding activity of CBG.</p><p>These observations highlight the limitations of methods used to measure CBG in biological samples. We have previously demonstrated that CBG variants with specific amino acid substitutions may either be undetectable in ELISAs using monoclonal antibodies (e.g., 12G2) because of a disruption in the epitope or in the BCA because of a loss of steroid-binding activity (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Our findings indicate that abnormalities in <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation alter the recognition of CBG in ELISAs in different ways depending on the monoclonal antibody used as the detection reagent, but may also confound BCA measurements. These analytical limitations were evident in the limited cohort of CDG patients available for our studies, but alterations of <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation are common in numerous acquired diseases (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), and this needs to be considered when measuring plasma CBG measurements in patients with these conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Declaration of interest</title><p>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest that could be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of the research reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>G L H held the Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Reproductive Health.
