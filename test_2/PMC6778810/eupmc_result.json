    "One of the evolutionary forces driving bacterial genome evolution is the acquisition of clusters of genes through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). These genomic islands may confer adaptive advantages to the recipient bacteria, such as, the ability to thwart antibiotics, become virulent or hypervirulent, or acquire novel metabolic traits. Methods for detecting genomic islands either search for markers or features typical of islands or examine anomaly in oligonucleotide composition against the genome background. The former tends to underestimate, missing islands that have the markers either lost or degraded, while the latter tends to overestimate, due to their inability to discriminate compositional atypicality arising because of HGT from those that are a consequence of other biological factors. We propose here a framework that exploits the strengths of both these approaches while bypassing the pitfalls of either. Genomic islands lacking markers are identified by their association with genomic islands with markers. This was made possible by performing marker enrichment and phyletic pattern analyses within an integrated framework of recursive segmentation and clustering. The proposed method, IslandCafe, compared favorably with frequently used methods for genomic island detection on synthetic test datasets and on a test-set of known islands from 15 well-characterized bacterial species. Furthermore, IslandCafe identified novel islands with imprints of likely horizontal acquisition."
