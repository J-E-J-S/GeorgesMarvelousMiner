    "Histone demethylase LSD1 plays key roles during carcinogenesis, targeting LSD1 is becoming an emerging option for the treatment of cancers. Numerous LSD1 inhibitors have been reported to date, some of them such as TCP, ORY-1001, GSK-2879552, IMG-7289, INCB059872, CC-90011, and ORY-2001 currently undergo clinical assessment for cancer therapy, particularly for small lung cancer cells (SCLC) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This review is to provide a comprehensive overview of LSD1 inhibitors in clinical trials including molecular mechanistic studies, clinical efficacy, adverse drug reactions, and PD/PK studies and offer prospects in this field."
