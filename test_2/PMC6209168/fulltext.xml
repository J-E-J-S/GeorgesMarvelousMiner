Although CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing has already been demonstrated for this plant, the efficiency was too low to apply to functional analysis. In this study, we show the establishment of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing vectors with high efficiency for both construction and genome editing. Codon optimization of Cas9 to Arabidopsis achieved over 70% genome editing efficiency at two loci tested. Systematic assessment revealed that guide sequences of 17 nt or shorter dramatically decreased this efficiency. We also demonstrated that a combinatorial use of this system and a floxed complementation construct enabled conditional analysis of a nearly essential gene. This study reports that simple, rapid, and efficient genome editing is feasible with the series of developed vectors.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>JSPS Kakenhi Specially Promoted Research of Grants-in-Aid</institution></funding-source><award-id>JP22000014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hara-Nishimura</surname><given-names>Ikuko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>MEXT Kakenhi Scientific Research on Innovative Area Grant</institution></funding-source><award-id>KP25113009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9712-4872</contrib-id><name><surname>Kohchi</surname><given-names>Takayuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>JSPS Kakenhi the Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B)</institution></funding-source><award-id>JP20726313</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sugano</surname><given-names>Shigeo S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>JST PRESTO Grant</institution></funding-source><award-id>11106</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sugano</surname><given-names>Shigeo S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>JSPS Research Fellowship for Young Scientists</institution></funding-source><award-id>24005453</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shirakawa</surname><given-names>Makoto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution>JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowships for Research Abroad</institution></funding-source><award-id>15J07657</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shirakawa</surname><given-names>Makoto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award007"><funding-source><institution>JSPS Kakenhi Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S)</institution></funding-source><award-id>JP17H07424</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9712-4872</contrib-id><name><surname>Kohchi</surname><given-names>Takayuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award008"><funding-source><institution>Ohtsuka Pharmaceuticals</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Osakabe</surname><given-names>Keishi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Specially Promoted Research to I.H-.N.

The system consists of two components: a Cas9 protein, which has an RNA-guided endonuclease activity, and a single guide RNA (gRNA), which specifies a target sequence within the genome. The Cas9 protein from <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> binds to the DNA sequence &#x0201c;NGG,&#x0201d; which is known as the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence. The interaction between a Cas9 protein and a PAM sequence induces the interaction between a gRNA and its target DNA sequence. If a sufficient length of the gRNA matches with the target sequence, the nuclease domains of Cas9 become capable of cutting the phosphodiester bonds on both sides of the strands, which are located 3 bp upstream of the PAM sequence [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Once a double-strand break (DSB) occurs, the error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathway is activated and sometimes introduces indels or base substitutions randomly at the target site, which could result in disruption of the target locus with various alleles.</p><p>This simple CRISPR/Cas9 system has been reconstructed in a wide range of eukaryotes, and researchers are now able to use molecular genetics in the species that are suitable for the purposes of their specific biological research [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Previous studies demonstrated that the CRISPR/Cas9 system works in a variety of plant species, from algae to crops [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which has greatly changed functional genetics in basic and applied plant research. Recent studies on the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205117.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and the green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205117.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reported highly efficient genome editing methods using CRISPR-based genome editing. Compared to flowering plants, such haploid generation-dominant plant species are free from the transheterozygosity issues associated with diploidy or polyploidy [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], allowing isolation of pure mutant lines for analysis with relative ease. In the meanwhile, regardless of the ploidy, but especially for haploid species, genome editing techniques cannot be simply applied to essential genes as this leads to lethality; conditional approaches are required.</p><p>The liverwort <italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic> is an emerging model species of land plants for studying plant evolution and gene function [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic> has good features for the application of reverse genetics. Most vascular plants and mosses are known to have experienced two or more whole genome duplication events, which makes it difficult to analyze gene functions due to the presence of paralogous genes. Sequencing of the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic> genome revealed no sign of a whole genome duplication and accordingly there is low genetic redundancy in most regulatory genes, such as transcription factors and signaling components [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition, non-chimeric individuals can be easily obtained and propagated via gemmae that are derived from single cells by asexual reproduction in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which accelerates transgenic experiments [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A variety of tools for molecular genetic experiments have been developed for <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], such as high-efficiency transformation methods [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], a homologous recombination-mediated gene targeting method [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], a systematic set of vectors [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and a conditional gene expression/deletion system [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Recently, a transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-based genome editing technology was established in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

However, the efficiency of genome editing was so low that the identification of plants with a mutation at the target locus required selection by a phenotype attributed to the mutation. Systematic optimization of Cas9 and gRNAs with rice, tobacco, and Arabidopsis showed that their expression levels greatly affected genome editing efficiencies [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205117.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], suggesting that there is room to improve genome editing efficiencies in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic>.</p><p>One of the issues in genome editing is to generate knockout lines of essential genes. Diploid or polyploid plants can bear lethal mutations heterozygously if recessive, whereas <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic>, a haploid-dominant plant, cannot. Therefore, functional analyses of essential genes require alternate strategies. Flores-Sandoval (2016) reported an inducible system for artificial microRNA expression in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic>. Another strategy would be to create conditional knockout mutants. In mice, this is usually achieved by inserting <italic>lox</italic>P sites into two different introns in the same direction with homologous-recombination-mediated gene targeting, and then expressing Cre recombinase at a specific time and/or location to remove an essential exon by site-specific recombination between the two <italic>lox</italic>P sites [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, this gene-targeting-based strategy is laborious and time-consuming.</p><p>Here, we report remarkable improvement in genome editing efficiency using Arabidopsis-codon-optimized (Atco) Cas9 to a degree that simple direct sequencing analysis of few number of transformants is sufficient to obtain genome-edited plants. In this efficient genome editing system, we assessed off-target effects and evaluated the influence of gRNAs length. Occurrence of large deletions using two gRNAs was also demonstrated. In addition, we provide a simple method to generate conditional knockout mutants by the simultaneous introduction of a mutation in the endogenous target gene by the CRISPR/Cas9 system and of a conditionally removable complementation gene as a transgene. Our improved CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing system can be used as a powerful molecular genetic tool in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Accessions, growth conditions and transformation of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic></title><p><italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic> Takaragaike-1 (Tak-1, male accession) and Takaragaike-2 (Tak-2, female accession) were used as wild types [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

At low frequency, normal thallus-looking tissues emerged after the induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205117.g007">Fig 7D</xref>, arrow) and still contained the complementing cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205117.g007">Fig 7E</xref>, &#x02018;non&#x02019;), suggesting the persistence of few cells that escaped the induction. These results suggest that Mp<italic>MPK1</italic> is indeed a nearly essential gene and, more importantly, demonstrated that conditional knockout mutants of an essential gene can be generated by a simple procedure using a CRISPR/Cas9 vector and a pMpGWB337 derivative in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec027"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using the <italic>Atco-Cas9</italic> expression cassette, we successfully optimized the CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing system for <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic> and improved the efficiency to a degree that does not require target gene-based phenotypic selection. This is consistent with a previous report that codon optimization of Cas9 lead to significant improvement in efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In fact, a higher accumulation level of Cas9 protein was observed with the <italic>Atco-Cas9</italic> expression cassette, compared with the <italic>hCas9</italic> one (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205117.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). In the pMpGE010/011 system, over 70% of transformants underwent targeted mutagenesis, shown by the two gRNAs ARF1_1 and NOP1_1 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205117.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205117.g002">2</xref>). These results indicate that the pMpGE010/011 vectors are highly reliable for obtaining genome-edited lines in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic>. Since the GC content of the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic> genome is 49.8% [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], Cas9 target sites with NGG PAM sequences can be found at high probability, and the selection of gRNA target sites with small numbers of off-target sites is possible. Taken together, we conclude that the pMpGE010/pMpGE011 system is feasible to use for functional genetics in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic> with likely avoidance of off-target effects.</p><p>As the system presented here allows constant expression of both Cas9 and a gRNA, two risks are conceivable: (i) a side effect of the overexpression of Cas9 protein on plant development and (ii) genome editing events at off-target sites. However, both risks appear to be negligible. Firstly, Mp<italic>nop1</italic> mutants obtained with our CRISPR system were indistinguishable in terms of growth and morphology from those obtained by T-DNA tagging [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] or gene targeting [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205117.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). In addition, the conditional Mp<italic>mpk1</italic> mutants generated in this study did not show any noticeable developmental defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205117.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). These observations suggest that there is no detrimental effect of Cas9 overexpression on plant development.</p><p>Sequencing of several potential off-target sites of 20-nt guide sequences revealed remarkably low off-target effects: no mutation was observed at any of the sites in over 30 lines that had on-target mutations. In plants, a similar low-level off-target effect was reported for Arabidopsis [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It was reported that truncated gRNA guide sequences (17 nt and 18 nt) show low off-target activities in mammalian cells [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic>, 17-nt and shorter gRNA guide sequences were not effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205117.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Taken together with the observed low off-target effects, to avoid unstable outcomes in isolating genome-edited lines, it is recommended to use gRNAs with 18-nt or longer guide sequences in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic>.</p><p>Constant expression of the CRISPR system allows transformants that have not had any alteration to potentially acquire mutations later at the target site in random cells during growth. Indeed, we observed that pMpGE010-transformed thalli with no target mutation in the T1 generation produced gammae with <italic>de novo</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205117.g005">Fig 5</xref>). This feature would be convenient for isolating mutant alleles without further transformation and could also be used for mosaic analyses. Conversely, even if a monoclonal mutant pattern is detected in genotyping using a portion of T1 plants, it does not guarantee that the whole plant has the same genotype. For genotyping, it is recommended to use a piece of T1 tissue from the basal side of the apical notch, as G1 gemmae derived from its apical-side tissues are most likely to be clones, with an identical genotype to that found in T1 [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In this research, we established the conditional knockout system using the Cre/<italic>lox</italic>P system, which is inducible by heat shock and DEX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205117.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Using this method, we successfully isolated transformants with a mutation in the Mp<italic>MPK1</italic> locus, which was expected to be essential. Mp<italic>MPK1</italic> is one of the three genes encoding canonical MAPKs and is most closely related to those categorized as groups A and B for plant MAPKs [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205117.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Major Arabidopsis MAPKs in these groups (MPK3/MPK6 and MPK4, respectively) have been shown to regulate various aspects of growth and development [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]: <italic>mpk3 mpk6</italic> double mutants are embryonic lethal [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and <italic>mpk4</italic> mutants show growth retardation with a cytokinesis defect [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The co-transformation-generated transgenic plants that had a mutation in the endogenous Mp<italic>MPK1</italic> locus exhibited no growth defect due to complementation by the expression of an Mp<italic>MPK1</italic> cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205117.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Induction of Cre/<italic>lox</italic>P recombination by heat shock and DEX treatment resulted in severe growth defects, indicating that MpMPK1 plays a critical role in the regulation of growth and development in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic> and that the conditional induction of the mutant phenotypes successfully occurred. Sectors of non-abnormal tissues sometimes arose, probably due to occasional failure of the Cre/<italic>lox</italic>P recombination. Thus, it is important to select conditional lines with highly efficient recombination induction from independently isolated candidates. The conditional knockout system developed in this study should not only facilitate functional analyses of essential genes, but also be useful for uncovering functions of non-essential genes in specific locations or timings.</p><p>DSBs created by CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing are usually repaired by the NHEJ pathway. Although the error-prone NHEJ repair pathway randomly inserts or deletes bases at the DSB sites, some tendencies were observed in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic>. For example, mutants with a &#x0003e;20 bp deletion were frequently obtained (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205117.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205117.g002">2</xref>), while such mutations are rare in genome editing in Arabidopsis [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205117.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This suggests that the NHEJ-based repair activity in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic> is relatively weaker than that in Arabidopsis. Consistent with this idea, homologous recombination-based gene targeting is possible in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic> with the average rate of 2&#x02013;3%, which is much higher than in Arabidopsis [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Since DSBs induced by the CRISPR/Cas9 system were reported to increase the efficiency of homologous recombination [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], it would be possible to improve the gene targeting efficiency in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic> by combination with the vectors presented in this study. Another frequently observed feature was the repair of DSBs by the microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205117.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Thus, precise integration of a DNA construct into target loci assisted by MMEJ, which is available for animals [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205117.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], would also be possible in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic>.</p><p>Construction of the genome editing vectors in the present study was very simple and inexpensive. Together with the fact that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polymorpha</italic> has low redundancy and small numbers of regulatory genes, our highly efficient CRISPR/Cas9 system would allow genome-editing-based genetic screens targeting all genes in a large subset of the genome, e.g., protein kinases, transcription factors, and miRNAs [<xref rid="pone.0205117.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205117.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205117.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Since the &#x0201c;pMpGE&#x0201d; CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing vectors reported in this study possess 35S promoter-based marker cassettes, the vectors can be utilized for genome editing in other plants in which Mp<italic>EF</italic><sub><italic>pro</italic></sub> and Mp<italic>U6-1</italic><sub><italic>pro</italic></sub> are operable. Highly efficient genome editing should facilitate uncovering gene regulatory networks that evolved for the land adaptation of plants and that underlie subsequent successful expansion of land plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec028"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0205117.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Protocols for gRNA cloning in entry vectors.</title><p>(A) pMpGE_En01 is designed to use the In-Fusion/Gibson cloning methods. pMpGE_En01 is digested by SacI and PstI.
