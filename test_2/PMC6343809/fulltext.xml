We have developed antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), comprising IgG1 linked via valine-citrulline to monomethyl auristatin E, with potential to treat HER2-positive gastric cancer in humans. The antibodies optimally selected from the ADC discovery platform, which was developed to discover antibody candidates suitable for immunoconjugates from synthetic antibody libraries designed using antibody-antigen interaction principles, were demonstrated to be superior immunoconjugate targeting modules in terms of efficacy and off-target toxicity. In comparison with the two control humanized antibodies (trastuzumab and H32) derived from murine antibody repertoires, the antibodies derived from the synthetic antibody libraries had enhanced receptor-mediated internalization rate, which could result in ADCs with optimal efficacies.

More than 600 clinical studies currently registered in ClinicalTrials.gov are related to HER2-positive cancers, and about a quarter of these studies are involved with antibody-based therapeutics/diagnostics targeting HER2-ECD. In addition to breast cancer and gastric cancer, HER2 over-expression has been found in other diverse cancers,<sup><xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref></sup> suggesting that a substantial number of cancer patients could potentially benefit from antibody therapeutics targeting HER2-ECD. Two HER2-ECD-targeting monoclonal antibodies are already approved for the treatment of cancers in humans: 1) trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast, gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer; and 2) pertuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer in metastatic or neoadjuvant setting.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref></sup> In addition, trastuzumab emtansine, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of trastuzumab conjugated through a non-reducible linker to the tubulin inhibitor mertansine, is approved for treating HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and has shown overall survival benefit and favorable safety profile over long follow-up durations.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref></sup> However, a recent report on the international randomized GATZBY Phase 2/3 trial indicates that trastuzumab emtansine is not superior to taxane in patients with previously treated HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref></sup> While HER2-ECD remains a validated target in several ongoing and planned clinical gastric cancer studies,<sup><xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref></sup> HER2-specific therapeutic options for treating advanced gastric cancer are still limited.</p><p>The aim of our study was to test ADCs designed to treat human HER2-positive gastric cancer. The treatment efficacies and off-target toxicities due to the antibodies as targeting modules were measured with the N87 model system, which has been a standard system as a HER2 over-expressing human gastric cancer cell line, and xenograft model.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref></sup> Three HER2-ECD-positive single-chain variable fragment (scFv) candidates (GH2-20, GH2-61 and GH2-75) from the synthetic antibody libraries<sup><xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref></sup> were selected through the high throughput antibody-based immunoconjugate discovery platform.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref></sup> Those with the highest potencies as targeting modules toward N87 cells were reformatted into human IgG1 antibodies and tested together with two positive control humanized IgG1 antibodies (trastuzumab and H32, which are humanized murine anti-HER2-ECD antibodies<sup><xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref></sup>) and one isotype negative control IgG antibody (nc). All these IgG1 antibodies were constructed with the same human IgG1 framework.</p><p>The efficacies of these IgG1 antibodies as the targeting modules for delivering cytotoxic payloads to N87 xenograft tumor models <italic>in vivo</italic> and to cultured N87 cells <italic>in vitro</italic> were scrutinized with three forms of immunoconjugates in this work: 1) ADC in the form of IgG1-vc-MMAE (monomethyl auristatin E linked to the IgG1 via valine-citrulline dipeptide cathepsin-cleavable linker);<sup><xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref></sup> 2) immunotoxin of a single polypeptide chain in the form of scFv-PE38KDEL fusion protein, where PE38KDEL is a truncated form of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> exotoxin (PE) A subunit toxin,<sup><xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref></sup> as pioneered by Pastan and colleagues;<sup><xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref></sup> and 3) immunotoxin in the form of IgG1-AL1-PE38KDEL, where the IgG1 is non-covalently linked to PE38KDEL through the adaptor-toxin fusion protein AL1-PE38KDEL.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref></sup> The AL1 fragment is composed of consecutive Protein A and Protein L separated by a polypeptide linker that enables Protein A and Protein L binding to the framework regions of the IgG1 simultaneously with nano-molar affinity.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref></sup> Since the IgG1 candidates were reformatted from the scFvs derived from the synthetic antibody libraries, which were designed using antibody-protein interaction principles from computational and experimental analyses<sup><xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref></sup> and built on a single human variable domain antibody germline framework (IGKV1-NL1*01/IGHV3-23*04),<sup><xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref></sup> the IgG1s bind to Protein A and Protein L through the variable domain framework heavy and light chain regions, respectively, without affecting the antigen binding sites of the antibodies.<sup><xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref></sup></p><p>The differences in the cytotoxic payloads and linkers among the three forms of immunoconjugate were anticipated to result in different effects on the efficacies of the antibodies as the immunoconjugates&#x02019; targeting modules, and hence provide information for ADC candidate selection and further development. The results showed that the treatments with the selected ADC (IgG1-vc-MMAE) candidates eradicated the xenograft tumor at the endpoint of the treatment without signs of off-target toxicity even at the highest dosage used in the treatments. The immunotoxins (scFv-PE38KDEL), on the other hand, could be envisaged as a sensitive surrogate system for detecting potential off-target toxicity <italic>in vivo</italic> associated with the antibodies as the targeting modules in the immunoconjugates. The non-covalently linked immunotoxins (IgG1-AL1-PE38KDEL) were much easier to prepare in comparison with the corresponding ADCs, and were more tolerable in terms of off-target toxicity in comparison with the corresponding scFv-PE38KDELs, and hence could be used as an inexpensive, albeit qualitative, system to select IgG candidates for further ADC development in terms of efficacy and off-target toxicity. These findings supported the utility of the general ADC discovery platform on the basis of the synthetic antibody libraries. The <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy/toxicity comparisons among the antibodies and the three forms of immunoconjugates contributed to the ADC candidate selection with different prospects on the candidate antibodies&#x02019; potencies and off-target toxicities.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Results</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>The IgG1 candidates as targeting modules in immunoconjugates</title><p>The scFvs candidates were selected by their representative physicochemical properties.

The ADCs were prepared with purified IgG1(trastuzumab), IgG1(H32), IgG1(GH2-75), IgG1(GH2-61) and IgG1(GH2-20) conjugated with vc-MMAE to a drug-antibody ratio (DAR) of 2 (Supplementary Figure S1 (A) and (B)). The vc-MMAE conjugation to the IgG1s did not affect the binding affinity of the IgG1s to HER2-ECD, as measured with ELISA (EC<sub>50</sub> measurements, Supplementary Figure S1 (C)), flow cytometry (mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of cell surface HER2-binding, Supplementary Figure S1 (D)) and SPR (Supplementary Table S1). The EC<sub>50</sub>s determined with ELISA measurements for all the IgG1s and IgG1-vc-MMAEs were similar (Supplementary Figure S1 (C)), but, in contrast, the flow cytometry measurements indicated that IgG1(GH2-20) and IgG1(GH2-20)-vc-MMAE had lower binding efficiency to cell surface HER2-ECD in comparison with all the other IgG1s and ADCs (Supplementary Figure S1 (D)), most likely due to the close proximity of the epitope of GH2-20 to the cell membrane for which the steric effect was not involved in the ELISA and SPR assay systems. The IC<sub>50</sub>s measured with the <italic>in vitro</italic> cell-based assay for the IgG1-vc-MMAEs are shown in Supplementary Figure S1 (E).</p><p>Xenograft N87 tumors were almost completely eradicated by some of the ADCs at high dosage without signs of off-target toxicity.

Serum biochemical analysis of all the subjects at the experiment endpoint indicated no substantial hepatic or renal toxicity due to the treatment (Supplementary Table S2), although the IgG1(trastuzumab)-vc-MMAE-treated mice had slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP), likely indicating drug-induced cholestatic hepatic toxicity.

Although the scFv(GH2-20)-PE38KDEL fusion protein had relatively lower affinity in comparison with the other scFv-PE38KDELs, likely due to the interference of the PE38KDEL module to the scFv(GH2-20)-antigen interaction, the scFv(GH2-20)-PE38KDEL cytotoxicity measured with the cell-based assay was only slightly inferior to those of the other scFv-PE38KDELs (Supplementary Figure S3 (D)).

The factors that could affect the cytotoxicity of the non-covalently linked immunotoxin include: IgG1 affinity to HER2-ECD, AL1-PE38KDEL affinity to the framework regions of the IgG1, interferences of the non-covalently linked AL1-PE38KDEL to the IgG1-HER2 interaction, cellular uptake efficiency of the IgG1-AL1-PE38KDEL complex and delivery efficiency of the cytotoxic payload to cytoplasm of the model cell.

In addition, the microSPECT/CT imaging of the IgG1 bio-distribution also supported that the IgG1(GH2-61) actively targeted the xenograft tumor with superior uptake rate over all the other IgG1 tested (<xref rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref> (C)).</p><p>In comparison, IgG1(GH2-20)-vc-MMAE was as potent as IgG1(GH2-61)-vc-MMAE in terms of eradicating xenograft tumors (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). IgG1(GH2-20)-AL1-PE38KDEL was comparable to IgG1(GH2-61)-AL1-PE38KDEL in terms of anti-tumor efficacy and off-target toxicity (<xref rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>), but was more toxic in the form of scFv-PE38KDEL (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>). However, in contrast to the IgG1(GH2-61), the IgG1(GH2-20) bound to the cell surface HER2-ECD with substantially lower binding efficiency (Supplementary Figure S1 (D)), resulting in much higher IC<sub>50</sub> measured with IgG1-vc-MMAE <italic>in vitro</italic> (Supplementary Figure S1 (E)), slower internalization rate (<xref rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref> (B)) and less efficient tumor uptake (<xref rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref> (C)). These results indicated that the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> indirect assays on the antibodies as targeting modules did not necessarily reflect the <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacies on xenograft models for the immunoconjugates in general. This conclusion is in agreement with the observation that affinity of antibody measured <italic>in vitro</italic> does not necessarily suggest better tumor uptake of the antibody <italic>in vivo</italic>.<sup><xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref></sup> Since the NOD/SCID mice used in the xenograft models lacked matured B and T cells and deficient natural killer (NK) cell function, the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> efficacy discrepancy of IgG1(GH2-20)-vc-MMAE is not likely to be attributed to the NK cell-based antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity of the xenograft mice. Other <italic>in vivo</italic> attributes that could explain the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> efficacy discrepancy remain unknown.</p><p>Although the antibody formats (IgG1 versus scFv), the linkers between the antibody and the toxic payload (covalent versus noncovalent) and the toxic payloads (MMAE versus PE38KDEL) are all different among the three forms of the immunoconjugates, our results regarding the off-target toxicities of the immunotoxins could nevertheless help to better select corresponding ADC candidates for further development. The <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse models were tolerant to all the HER2-ECD-targeting IgG1-vc-MMAEs at high dosage (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref> and Supplementary Table S2). Conversely, the mouse models were intolerant to all the HER2-ECD-targeting scFv-PE38KDELs except scFv(GH2-61)-PE38KDEL at very low dosage (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>). The intolerance of the immunotoxins could have resulted from off-target toxicity. Since the off-target toxicity cannot be measured or predicted with <italic>in vitro</italic> systems, the immunotoxin form scFv-PE38KDEL could be used as a sensitive surrogate system for detecting potential off-target toxicity <italic>in vivo</italic> associated with the antibody as the targeting module. This is particularly useful when the corresponding IgG1-vc-MMAE is not obviously toxic at elevated dosage levels in the experiments with xenograft models. However, the scFv-PE38KDEL could be a less relevant model mimicking the conventional IgG-based ADC because the monovalent scFv could result in substantially different effects in toxin delivery in comparison with that of the divalent IgG; therefore, the IgG1-AL1-PE38KDEL could be a more relevant model for the IgG-based ADC. The IgG1-AL1-PE38KDEL immunotoxins were less toxic to the mouse models than the scFv-PE38KDEL immunotoxins at medium dosage (<xref rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref> and Supplementary Table S3), and the potencies of the IgG1-AL1-PE38KDELs towards the xenograft models could be related qualitatively to those of the corresponding IgG1-vc-MMAEs. Hence, the IgG1-AL1-PE38KDELs could be used as a less costly replacement for the corresponding covalently linked ADCs to identify highly potent antibody candidates with low off-target toxicity. Although the targeting discrepancy between the IgG and scFv, the dissociation of the IgG and AL1-PE38KDEL and the formulation of the immunotoxins could hamper the utility of IgG1-AL1-PE38KDEL and scFv-PE38KDEL as surrogate systems to select corresponding ADC candidates <italic>in vivo</italic> for further development, both forms of immunotoxin could nevertheless be of use when the <italic>in vitro</italic> efficacy and toxicity measurements of the immunoconjugates with cultured cells do not reflect their <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy and toxicity on xenograft models.</p><p>In conclusion, the potency of ADCs as anti-cancer therapeutics requires optimal delivery of the cytotoxic payloads by the ADCs&#x02019; antibodies as the targeting modules while maintaining low off-target toxicities. Antibodies from the synthetic antibody libraries underlying the high throughput immunoconjugate discoveries enabled a rapid process to develop potent ADCs capable of eradicating xenograft tumors in mice, as demonstrated in this work. In comparison with the two humanized control antibodies (trastuzumab and H32) derived from murine antibody repertoires, some of the antibodies (GH2-61 and GH2-20) derived from the synthetic antibody libraries have enhanced internalization rate, which could result in ADCs with optimal efficacies. Moreover, <italic>in vitro</italic> assays with cultured cells could narrow the antibody candidate population and gain insights into the optimization of the antibodies as the targeting modules in ADCs, but the <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy and toxicity of the ADCs are frequently unpredictable from the <italic>in vitro</italic> measurements. We have found that <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments with the three forms of immunoconjugates on xenograft models further provide information for the ADC candidate selection in terms of potencies and off-target toxicities as anti-cancer therapeutics. These findings support the strategy to develop optimal ADCs against cancers with the utility of the general ADC discovery platform on the basis of the synthetic antibody libraries in combination with the <italic>in vivo</italic> tests on xenograft models with the three forms of immunoconjugates.</p></sec><sec id="S0004"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S0004-S2001"><title>Cell culture and tumor xenograft studies</title><p>Human gastric carcinoma cell line NCI-N87 was acquired from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
