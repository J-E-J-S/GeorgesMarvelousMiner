Their ability to readily manipulate the native genomic loci is particularly advantageous. In this work, we serendipitously uncover the key cytokine <italic>IL6</italic> as an off-target of the activating derivative of CRISPR (CRISPRa) while studying <italic>RP11-326A19</italic>.<italic>4</italic>, a novel long-non coding RNA (lncRNA). Increasing <italic>RP11-326A19</italic>.<italic>4</italic> expression in HEK293T cells via CRISPRa-mediated activation of its promoter region induced genome-wide transcriptional changes, including upregulation of <italic>IL6</italic>, an important cytokine. <italic>IL6</italic> was increased in response to distinct sgRNA targeting the <italic>RP11-326A19</italic>.<italic>4</italic> promoter region, suggesting specificity. Loss of the cognate sgRNA recognition sites failed to abolish CRISPRa mediated activation of <italic>IL6</italic> however, pointing to off-target effects. Bioinformatic approaches did not reveal predicted off-target binding sites. Off-target activation of <italic>IL6</italic> was sustained and involved low level activation of known <italic>IL6</italic> regulators. Increased <italic>IL6</italic> remained sensitive to further activation by TNF&#x003b1;, consistent with the existence of independent mechanisms. This study provides experimental evidence that CRISPRa has discrete, unpredictable off-targeting limitations that must be considered when using this emerging technology.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McPherson</surname><given-names>Ruth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by a Canadian Institutes for Health Research Foundation grant (RM).

Not only do CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins allow for relatively facile genomic editing, inactive variants are continuously being created to study gene function [<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Specificity of Cas9 has been extensively studied [<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Optimal cleavage by <italic>sp</italic>Cas9 requires anRNA co-factor, either a two-part guide RNA component (native context) or in a more artificial and practical setting, a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) consisting of a 20-mer spacer sequence that confers cleavage specificity and a longer generic scaffold. In addition, the cognate DNA sequence must be followed by a NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). This requirement allows, in theory, spCas9 to cut at a unique site of the human genome. In practice however, cleavage can occur at other sites [<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, variants harnessing the DNA homing properties of Cas proteins, and in particular Cas protein 9 (Cas9), are continuously being engineered to be used as research tools. The resulting fusion proteins are typically comprised of a deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) that retains its DNA binding properties, fused to various regulatory domains that can influence genomic regulation, including transcriptional activation and repression (CRISPRa and CRISPRi, respectively). Compared to wild-type Cas9, dCas9 fusions need only to bind DNA in the proper orientation to impart <italic>de novo</italic> function. Current evidence indicates that each sgRNA has the potential to direct Cas9 or dCas9 to tens to thousands of sites [<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. While this represents an upper limit and <italic>de facto</italic> binding events are likely not as pervasive due to nucleosome interference [<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the genome contains abundant potential off-target binding sites. Whether these binding events persist long enough to have functional outcomes is unclear.</p><p>Driven by increasingly sensitive genome-wide expression analyses, a new level of regulatory control has emerged over the last decade, as it was realized that a significant proportion of the genome which was heretofore believed to be transcriptionally silent was rather expressing long transcripts. Although they lack salient protein coding potential, these long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) form a class of RNAs in many respects similar to traditional mRNA: lncRNA are relatively long, contain polyA tails and undergo alternative splicing, although splicing of lncRNA is typically more extensive [<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition conservation tends to be lower than for protein coding genes [<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Some but not all lncRNA appear to be functional [<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which may reflect our inability to properly test for biological significance [<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. To account for their lack of conservation, it has been proposed that the very act of transcription at lncRNA loci, rather than the transcript <italic>per se</italic>, determines function [<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. With these features in mind, the advent of CRISPRa methodology seemed particularly suited to tackle lncRNA function as targeting CRISPRa/i upstream of lncRNA genes in principle 1- permits transcriptional activation (or repression) and 2- induces changes in the native transcript levels, including all forms of spliced variants, whose ratio may be important for function.</p><p>IL6 is a broadly expressed cytokine with wide ranging impacts on multiple biological systems. Key implications of IL6 in cancer, inflammation, coronary artery disease (<italic>IL6R</italic>), hematopoiesis, and metabolic processes have been reported [<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Using different binding modalities in specific contexts, IL6 provides either pro- or anti-inflammatory cues. A considerable body of literature dealing with regulation of <italic>IL6</italic> has shown it to be under extensive transcriptional and translational control. Post-transcriptionally, <italic>IL6</italic> is a relatively unstable transcript, regulated by several microRNA and protein regulators that interact with the 3&#x02019; UTRs of the mature transcript [<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Here we demonstrate that targeting CRISPRa to distinct regions of a novel lncRNA promoter region leads to <italic>IL6</italic> upregulation, largely via off-target effects. The mechanisms underpinning the activation implicate increased transcription via a low level activation of established <italic>IL6</italic> inducers. These findings add a note of caution regarding the reliability of current CRISPRa technology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Validation of a long non-coding RNA situated proximal to a region associated with coronary artery disease</title><p>While investigating the role of a GWAS-identified locus for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) at15q26 near <italic>MFGE8</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we identified a region encoding putative, uncharacterized transcripts (<italic>RP11-326A19</italic>.<italic>4/TCONS_00023492</italic>) immediately adjacent to the risk region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224113.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The proximity of the transcripts to the CAD region hinted at a possible link to atherosclerosis, thus warranting further investigation of the gene locus.

In this regard, the ability of the dCas9 derivatives to modulate both transcript abundance and complexity via endogenous gene regulation, seemed appropriate for the study of <italic>RP11</italic>. First, this approach was contingent on the identification of the promoter region of <italic>RP11</italic>. Exploiting annotated chromatin marks, proximity, ChiP and DNAse sensitivity, a ~ 1.5 kb region that included the putative exon 1 of <italic>RP11</italic> was identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224113.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). In several cell types, the region is predicted to interact with general transcription factors (USF2, USF1, FOS) and core transcription machinery (POLR2A). To examine its ability to operate as a promoter, the corresponding region was subcloned upstream of a luciferase reporter and introduced in HEK293T and HeLa cells. Presence of the putative promoter conferred robust luciferase activity, reaching levels on par with promoters derived from <italic>SV40</italic> and <italic>MFGE8</italic>, a gene flanking <italic>RP11</italic> whose transcript is abundant and widely expressed (GTex) in both HeLa cells and HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224113.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Functional validation of the putative promoter was performed using the CRISPRa and CRISPRi systems. Constructs expressing dCas9 fused to either the VP160 activator or the KRAB repressor were introduced into HEK293T cells, in conjunction with sgRNA expressing plasmids to target CRISPRa/i to the <italic>RP11</italic> promoter region. Transfection of CRISPRa and CRISPRi plasmids resulted in either activation or repression, respectively, of <italic>RP11</italic> expression that reflected the predicted cognate sgRNA binding site: the impact was maximal in the middle of the region and attenuated on either side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224113.g003">Fig 3</xref>); interestingly the region of maximal activation was central to reported DNase I hypersensitivity and ChIP Seq region. DNA accessibility seemed insufficient for activation as regions located closer to the transcription start site did not support activation, reflecting the presence of other constraints (e.g. CRISPRa position relative to the transcription machinery, orientation, lack of binding etc&#x02026;).</p><fig id="pone.0224113.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0224113.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Identification and characterization of putative <italic>RP11</italic> promoter.</title><p>A, Identification of putative promoter region.

Unfortunately, HEK293T cells were found unsuitable since <italic>IL6</italic> levels therein did not respond to TNF&#x003b1; treatment (2 h, 30 ng/ml; 1.2-fold (&#x000b1; 0.24) over vehicle (n = 2). Rather, the impact of CRISPRa on <italic>RP11</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> was examined in a different cell type, HuH-7, a hepatoma cell line widely used to study hepatocyte function. Inflammatory components, including <italic>IL6</italic>, have been shown to play crucial roles in normal and pathological liver functions [<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As in HEK293T, SG<sup>-286</sup> and SG<sup>-505</sup> increased <italic>RP11</italic>, although the fold-increase was more dramatic, possibly due to lower basal expression of <italic>RP11</italic> in those cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0224113.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). HuH-7 cells were also responsive to TNF&#x003b1;, at least acutely: addition of TNF&#x003b1; for 2 h resulted in increased <italic>IL-6</italic> in na&#x000ef;ve or mock transfected cells, although statistical significance was only reached for mock (Lipof3000) transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224113.g010">Fig 10</xref>). By contrast, longer treatments had no noticeable impact on <italic>IL6</italic>. Introduction of dCas9-VPR/SG<sup>-286</sup> was sufficient to increase <italic>IL6</italic> to levels on par with those reached with TNF&#x003b1; treatment alone. Combining dCas9-VPR/SG<sup>-286</sup> with TNF&#x003b1; conferred an additional increase, albeit without noticeable synergy. These results clearly demonstrate that CRISPRa does not interfere with normal TNF&#x003b1; signaling, insofar as <italic>IL6</italic> is concerned, but rather suggest that both contribute, independently, to <italic>IL6</italic> upregulation.</p><fig id="pone.0224113.g010" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0224113.g010</object-id><label>Fig 10</label><caption><title>Distinct effects of TNF&#x003b1; and CRISPRa on the stimulation of <italic>IL6</italic> expression.</title><p>HuH-7 cells were transfected with dCas9-VPR and the indicated SG constructs for 48 h.

CRISPRa/i approaches offer the ability to regulate <italic>in situ</italic> transcription with unparalleled ease and thus facilitate research on lncRNA. Using CRISPRa/i, we demonstrated that expression of neighboring genes was resistant to <italic>RP11-326A19</italic>.<italic>4</italic> perturbation. Rather a long distance impact on several transcripts, including <italic>IL6</italic>, was observed. We chose to focus on <italic>IL6</italic>, based on its known importance in human coronary artery disease. Importantly, validation studies indicated that increased <italic>IL6</italic> was the result of off-target activity by CRISPRa.</p><p>The observation that 4 out of 10 sgRNA targeting <italic>RP11</italic> lead to increased <italic>IL6</italic> is intriguing and could be construed to indicate specificity. To our surprise we found that when tested via binding site abrogation, 2 different sgRNA were non-specific, i.e. altered <italic>IL6</italic> via other means. The mechanism(s) remain unclear. In contrast to <italic>IL6</italic>, the same sgRNAs had little or no effect on controls (<italic>SRP14</italic> and <italic>TRIBI</italic>). To control for the promoter region of <italic>RP11</italic>, 10 other sequences designed to target the <italic>MFGE8</italic> promoter region had no or very modest effects on <italic>IL6</italic>. One possible explanation may be that the <italic>RP11</italic> promoter region is rich in sequences that are linked to <italic>IL6</italic> upregulation. Although sequence homology searches (BLAST) revealed no salient homology between the <italic>IL6</italic> gene and sgRNA used, the proclivity of dCas9 to bind promiscuously leaves open the possibility that it binds to <italic>IL6</italic> regulatory regions. In view of the current bioinformatic limitations, teasing out CRISPRa target(s) mediating <italic>IL6</italic> upregulation will require genome-wide interrogation of <italic>in situ</italic> binding sites, followed by their functional validations.</p><p>While the events surrounding CRISPRa binding are unclear, our study demonstrates that <italic>IL6</italic> upregulation involves traditional <italic>IL6</italic> master regulators. This conclusion is based on inhibitor evidence, which blocked <italic>IL6</italic> upregulation. However, as phosphorylation remained below detection, increased <italic>IL6</italic> could be not be linked to the activation status of the regulators. This could simply reflect the transient nature of the activation which might be reversed at the time of analysis. However we note that activation continues beyond this time point, which seems inconsistent with that interpretation. The progressive, long-term accumulation of <italic>IL6</italic> versus the more conventional transient response typically studied, points to an alternative explanation. We speculate that these regulators are activated minimally, yet sufficiently to induce a slow and continuous rise in <italic>IL6</italic>. This accumulation of <italic>IL6</italic> most likely involves both increased output as well as stabilization at the mRNA, both of which are known to control <italic>IL6</italic> and immunokine levels in general [<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>dCas9 derivatives are increasingly being leveraged to interrogate biological mechanisms. For instance to understand and manipulate enhancer function, complementary dCas9 variants can be targeted to different regions of the genome thereby forcing their juxtaposition [<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Correct interpretation of the generated datasets relies on unmitigated binding localization which, as shown here, this technology does not allow. More significantly, therapeutic interventions involving activation of transcription suppressed genes, great care should be exercised given the significant possibility of off-target interactions.</p><p>The off-target effects reported here are for <italic>Staphylococcus pyogenes</italic> Cas9 derivatives, arguably the most commonly used form, largely for historical reasons. Other Cas variants have different cutting specificities but their applicability to multiplexed applications, where binding rather than cutting is the parameter of interest, remains to be as thoroughly investigated as spCas9. In order to obtain robust and truly useful tools, the dCas methodologies must be further improved. Indeed as little as a 5 mer + PAM sequence might be sufficient to confer binding to d(sp)Cas9 in mouse embryonic stem cells [<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This will require binding optimization, including greater specificity and affinity. The use of shorter oligonucleotides was shown to improve cleavage specificity somewhat but the suitability of this approach to minimize off-target binding is doubtful [<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Wild-type enzymes have evolved for both binding and cutting, and considerable room exists for molecular engineering approaches to favor binding specificity, likely at the expense of cutting. For instance, Cas9 derived from <italic>Neisseria meningitis</italic> is a recently described compact Cas9 that exhibits higher cutting fidelity and would be of potential interest in this regard [<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. By contrast, Cas9 from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> has been recently shown to be undergo faster turnover which may translate into weaker substrate affinity and mitigate its ability to be effective as CRISPRa/i [<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>This study includes an early investigation of <italic>RP11-326A19</italic>.<italic>4</italic> function which future work will aim to enrich by identifying <italic>bona fide</italic> effectors. Activating the <italic>RP11</italic> locus via CRISPRa/SG<sup>-286</sup> led to an upregulation bias, hinting that a substantial subset of the affected genes may in fact stem from off-target binding. To aid with on-target identification, expression changes induced by other <italic>RP11</italic> targeting sgRNA will be compared and contrasted [<xref rid="pone.0224113.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The observation that <italic>IL6</italic> was independently upregulated with two sgRNA targeting <italic>RP11</italic>, reinforces the need for multiple additional sgRNA. Lastly, orthogonal interventions such as antisense oligonucleotides or <italic>RP11</italic> transduction are currently underway to examine the role of the transcript proper.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec016"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec017"><title>Tissue culture and drug treatments</title><p>Cells were maintained in Dulbecco&#x02019;s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing either 4.5 g/l glucose (HEK293T, HeLa) or 1 g/l (HuH-7).

The authors described the possible interference of the CRISPRa with the IL-6 cytokine, that can generate some concerns for the usage of this tool in future therapies. Although the idea is interesting, in my opinion the study needs some adjustments and clarifications before publication:</p><p>1) Why did the authors choose RP11 and not TCONS that are in the same Risky area?</p><p>2) Please, redesign Figure 1B because the scheme representing the primers binding is not clear and the results are not easy to read, make it clear. The PCR bands are too smeared.</p><p>3) Figure 2B: statistics analysis is missing. Please, explain why the MFGE8 promoter was chosen as control in this experiment.</p><p>4) Figure 3: y-axis the relative expression level is normalized to cells transfected with trcrRNA? This is not clear indeed in Figure 4A the y-axis name changes in &#x0201c;normalized to trcrRNA plasmid&#x0201d; that is not correct, because is it not possible to compare cDNA quantification with a plasmid. Moreover, it should be normalized using a housekeeping gene for the specific cell type.</p><p>5) The paragraph from line 163 to 174 is not clear please try to explain in a different way.</p><p>6) In the text, lines 184-185 the authors stated that after CRISPRi (using dCas9 fused to KRAB inhibitor) the RP11 expression was 30% lower with no effects on IL-6. It seems strange because it is known (Gao, X., Tsang, J. C., Gaba, F., Wu, D., Lu, L., &#x00026; Liu, P. (2014) Nucleic acids research, 42(20), e155-e155.) that CRISPRi is even more effective for endogenous genes, and the off-target effect is mainly due to sgRNA used. This result is not demonstrating an off-target of the system because the RP11 can be an enhancer of the IL-6 gene (already demonstrated for lncRNA) and repressing it doesn&#x02019;t mean that the endogen IL-6 is not transcribed.</p><p>7) Figure 4B: the authors showed that using different sgRNAs on RP11 promoter is leading to an increase of IL-6 due to CRISPRa. This seems real if consider only sgRNA -567, -505 and -286 (the guide with the strongest effect) but my concerned are about sgRNA -546, indeed using that guide the increase of RP11 seem to be not significant and the associated IL-6 is very high, can the authors speculate a little on this result? Moreover, if the off-target effect is not driven by sgRNA as explained with this figure, how can the deactivated Cas9 binds the DNA to drive the transcriptional machinery?</p><p>8) Figure 5: the authors tried to generate a partial promoter knock-out part of the 5&#x02019; UTR and exon 1, and they failed, &#x0201c;Unfortunately, the process yielded only compound heterozygotes&#x0201d;. My concerns regarding these experiments are due to the deletions: in three out of four deletions is resulted in heterozygotes (also if is not so clear, the smaller band seem two and not only one) and in the first one failed. Which cells did the authors use to perform the deletions? Maybe the problem is due to the presence of more than two copies of the genomic asset of the cell line? That should be clarified because the effect resulted can be also influenced by that. Moreover, I will suggest adding a chromatogram showing the junctions of the deletion, in fact using two sgRNAs is leading to a non-homologous recombination that can also interfere with the sgRNA -505 binding site. In Figure 5C the relative expression of RP11 and IL-6 in the wild type are opposed to what the authors showed in figure 4B, in Figure 5C the levels of RP11 in wild type are higher than IL-6 after transfection with both sgRNA-286 and -505. It diminishes the consistence of the data on heterozygous, thus the increment of IL-6 seem to be related to cells external or internal conditions.</p><p>9) In the Figure 6 is not clear why the authors did choose the SRP14 as a control. Moreover, they changed the relative for the normalization from transfected with the trcrRNA to PPIA. It would be more linear If they normalize everything to a fixed housekeeping. In addition, the standard deviation of the RP11 values at 72h is very high, maybe the experiment should be confirmed.</p><p>10) Did the authors try the alignment of the IL-6 and the RP11 promoters? I will advise doing it to understand the dissimilarity between them.</p><p>11) In Figure 7A, the authors want to demonstrate the inhibition effect of IL-6 transcription marking different kinases? These experiments are not clear and need to be represented in a better way. Moreover, Figure 7B can be moved to supplementary data eliminating the Ponceau panel and reducing the green background of pIKKA/B. I suggest adding a positive control if possible, for the Western Blots.</p><p>12) In the sentence from line 318 to 319, the authors described that the dCas9 can bind the DNA &#x0201c;promiscuously&#x0201d;, regarding this I didn&#x02019;t see in all the experiments the usage of the dCas9 fused to activators alone, to evaluate this promiscuous behavior. Indeed, they showed only the association with trcrRNA (please clarify the identity of this construct).</p><p>13) It was previously described that lncRNA RP11 is associated with tumor differentiation [Ke Su et al. 2018, ISSN:2156-6976/ajcr0081106] and interacts in someway with IL-6 transcription. The authors should check the eventual interaction between the lncRNA with the IL-6 transcription and verify if there are more articles describing this phenomenon.</p><p>14) As a suggestion, after all the expression data using qPCR, I think it is more consistent to show an increment of the IL-6 protein. As matter of fact, it is clearly demonstrated that RNA increase is not directly associated with protein increment.</p><p>[NOTE: If reviewer comments were submitted as an attachment file, they will be attached to this email and accessible via the submission site.

The relevant section has been expanded and the actual published work has now been referenced in order to facilitate understanding. </p><p>Line 107: The authors should annotate the primers in the schematic representation of the locus. Furthermore, the authors need to explain how the results support the presence of an alternatively spliced exon.</p><p>The presence of an alternatively spliced exon is inferred from the systematic presence of a doublet using distinct non-overlapping primers spanning the same region spanning exon 1 and exon 2. The upper band is predicted to result from the presence of an additional sequence of about 100 bp, possibly of exonic origin. As the product was not sequenced, this is only inferred (hence the term &#x0201c;consistent&#x0201d;. Note that alternative splicing is quite prevalent in lncRNAs and retention of longer exons or inclusion of additional exons is common. Wording in the Fig 1 legend was modified to better convey this. In addition, to further facilitate understanding, the oligonucleotides have been annotated (numbered) as suggested. The last lane which was a technical repeat of an earlier lane, was removed.</p><p>Line 118: The authors should explain how the reporter construct is employed, and what it is.</p><p>This has now been clarified in the Results section.</p><p>Figure 3 Legend: The authors should explain the normalization strategy more clearly. I cannot understand what they mean by &#x0201c;Results are displayed as a function of the predicted binding region of the cgRNA, relative to exon 1 of RP11, set to 1&#x0201d;.</p><p>We agree. The sentence was confusing and the normalization strategy clarified. </p><p>Line 127: If the region of maximal activation overlaps with the DNAseI hypersensitivity and ChIP Seq region, why is guide -267 and -102 not more active?</p><p>There could be numerous reasons for this, including occupancy by existing factors competing with CRISPR/Cas9 or positional/orientation constraints relative to the transcriptionstart site. We have now included a short sentence to the effect that accessibility is insufficient for activation.</p><p>Line 149: Describe the experiment &#x0201c;Array analysis&#x0201d;</p><p>This section has been reworded to clarify the experimental context.</p><p>Line 212: The authors state that only heterozygotes were found. How many clones were tested? Is there an explanation why there were only heterozygotes? Where the clones heterozygote for the ~400pb deletion? Also, show the editing profiles.</p><p>48 clones were tested and only three heterozygotes were obtained. This information has now been added to the methods section and clarified in the legend. This outcome is not uncommon as dual deletion are rare in CRISPR edition, probably as a result of the dominance of the non-homologous end joining which favors rapid editing and rejoining of ends at the expense of the desired longer distance recombination/rejoining events. Based on our findings we estimate that the likelihood of obtaining a knock-out (biallelic deletion of the promoter region) to approach 0.3% (3/48 X 3/48). Sanger sequencing results of the heterozygotes are included as Fig 6 (promoter/exon 1 deletion) and within S4 Fig (SG-505 editing).</p><p>Line 246: The authors should perform an unbiased off-target detection experiment, such as GUIDE-seq. This is not, as the authors state in line 323, a colossal undertaking. Furthermore, this can shed more light on the mechanism underlying the activation of IL6. I understand that multiple guides gave a similar phenotypic result (IL6 upregulation), but this could be explained by similarity in the promotor or enhancer regions.</p><p>We agree that colossal is a superlative here. The end of the sentence has been removed and changed to reflect our ongoing investigation into this locus. Experimental off-target detection methods such as GUIDE-seq offer a very useful way to interrogate active CRISPR/Cas9 specificity. Unfortunately, this approach does not address binding per se, but cleavage, which requires more stringent mechanistic requirements than mere binding. As such it is not suited for dCAS9 interrogation where cleavage is not involved. As discussed in the manuscript, by removing the DNA cleavage requirement, productive dCAS9 &#x0201c;events&#x0201d; are predicted to be much more promiscuous. Rather one would have to resort to genome-wide dCAS9 binding assays (ChiP style) in the presence and absence of cgRNA. As mentioned previously in the manuscript, this analysis has been performed, albeit in a different context (Wu et al, 2014). </p><p>As for the IL6 link, an approach could be to use 2-3 cgRNA that activate IL6 and control ones. While we feel that such an experiment has indeed considerable appeal in that all/most binding events would be identified, the findings would require a series of follow-up experimental validation to disentangle IL6 relevant from IL6 irrelevant interactions. This question is most appropriate for a future publication. </p><p>Figure 7A: How was the normalization performed?</p><p>Modifications have been made to the legend to clarify this point.</p><p>Minor comments/suggestions</p><p>Line 50: S.p.Cas9 does not require a single guideRNA (sgRNA) as it can also employ a two-part guide RNA consisting of a crRNA and a tracrRNA.</p><p>Agreed.

An additional sentence has been added to improve comprehension.</p><p>Reviewer #2: This is a manuscript about the possible off-targeting problems relative to the usage of the emerging CRISPR activation system. The authors described the possible interference of the CRISPRa with the IL-6 cytokine, that can generate some concerns for the usage of this tool in future therapies. Although the idea is interesting, in my opinion the study needs some adjustments and clarifications before publication:</p><p>1) Why did the authors choose RP11 and not TCONS that are in the same Risky area?</p><p>Because of their lack of obvious coding potential and lower conservation, determining the exonic structure of lncRNAs is somewhat challenging. RP11 and TCONS correspond to the same gene locus. TCONS_00023493 and RP11-326A19.4 are derived from semi-automated annotations of putative transcripts using different underlying data sets and integrations: RP11-326A19.4 is predicted by the GENCODE genes project and TCONS transcripts are predicted by the Human Body Map consortium. This is explained in the legend. </p><p>2) Please, redesign Figure 1B because the scheme representing the primers binding is not clear and the results are not easy to read, make it clear. The PCR bands are too smeared.</p><p>As mentioned in the response to Reviewer 1, the figure has been simplified. As for the PCR bands being too smeared, this is in part due to the PCR buffer conditions (PCR Terra direct) and the small size of the fragments. Attempts were made to improve visualization by adjusting the exposure and contrast of the image. Two bands were reproducibly observed with exons spanning intron 1 (linking exon 1 and 2) as addressed in the figure legend.</p><p>3) Figure 2B: statistics analysis is missing. Please, explain why the MFGE8 promoter was chosen as control in this experiment.</p><p>All changes were significant relative to the control plasmid (promotorless). All promoters conferred similar inductions (not statistically different from each other, ANOVA). This is now clarified in the figure legend. MFGE8 was chosen as a logical progression of our previous works where we characterized the impact of the CARMA region (RP11 is located between MFGE8 and ABHD2). More relevant to this manuscript is the fact that MFGE8 is widely expressed at relatively high level, indicating that the promoter is quite potent; this information has been incorporated in the Results section.</p><p>4) Figure 3: y-axis the relative expression level is normalized to cells transfected with trcrRNA? This is not clear indeed in Figure 4A the y-axis name changes in &#x0201c;normalized to trcrRNA plasmid&#x0201d; that is not correct, because is it not possible to compare cDNA quantification with a plasmid. Moreover, it should be normalized using a housekeeping gene for the specific cell type.</p><p>Normalization was not performed vs plasmid DNA, but to values (X/PPIA) derived from cells transfected to dCAS9 + trcrRNA plasmids. The ordinate description has been changed to facilitate understanding (throughout the manuscript).</p><p>5) The paragraph from line 163 to 174 is not clear please try to explain in a different way.</p><p>Table 1 and its attached text have been expanded to address this. Over representation analysis is briefly explained.</p><p>6) In the text, lines 184-185 the authors stated that after CRISPRi (using dCas9 fused to KRAB inhibitor) the RP11 expression was 30% lower with no effects on IL-6. It seems strange because it is known (Gao, X., Tsang, J. C., Gaba, F., Wu, D., Lu, L., &#x00026; Liu, P. (2014) Nucleic acids research, 42(20), e155-e155.) that CRISPRi is even more effective for endogenous genes, and the off-target effect is mainly due to sgRNA used. This result is not demonstrating an off-target of the system because the RP11 can be an enhancer of the IL-6 gene (already demonstrated for lncRNA) and repressing it doesn&#x02019;t mean that the endogen IL-6 is not transcribed.</p><p>Rules for optimal CRISPRa and CRISPRi differ somewhat, with optimal CRISPRi typically needing sgRNA internal to the transcribed region (essentially steric hindrance of the pol II complex progression), whereas CRISPRa is more effective towards the upstream region to help engage the complex. In that sense, SG-286 is not optimal for CRISPRi, which likely accounts for the small inhibition on RP11. SG-286 was used in order to better compare both systems (similar off-targets etc&#x02026;) A sentence has been added to this effect.</p><p>7) Figure 4B: the authors showed that using different sgRNAs on RP11 promoter is leading to an increase of IL-6 due to CRISPRa. This seems real if consider only sgRNA -567, -505 and -286 (the guide with the strongest effect) but my concerned are about sgRNA -546, indeed using that guide the increase of RP11 seem to be not significant and the associated IL-6 is very high, can the authors speculate a little on this result? Moreover, if the off-target effect is not driven by sgRNA as explained with this figure, how can the deactivated Cas9 binds the DNA to drive the transcriptional machinery?</p><p>These inconsistencies were duly noted in our previous version but not explained. These findings were interpreted as possible off-target effects on IL6 and this is now explicitly mentioned. </p><p>.</p><p>8) Figure 5: the authors tried to generate a partial promoter knock-out part of the 5&#x02019; UTR and exon 1, and they failed, &#x0201c;Unfortunately, the process yielded only compound heterozygotes&#x0201d;. My concerns regarding these experiments are due to the deletions: in three out of four deletions is resulted in heterozygotes (also if is not so clear, the smaller band seem two and not only one) and in the first one failed. Which cells did the authors use to perform the deletions? Maybe the problem is due to the presence of more than two copies of the genomic asset of the cell line? That should be clarified because the effect resulted can be also influenced by that. Moreover, I will suggest adding a chromatogram showing the junctions of the deletion, in fact using two sgRNAs is leading to a non-homologous recombination that can also interfere with the sgRNA -505 binding site. In Figure 5C the relative expression of RP11 and IL-6 in the wild type are opposed to what the authors showed in figure 4B, in Figure 5C the levels of RP11 in wild type are higher than IL-6 after transfection with both sgRNA-286 and -505. It diminishes the consistence of the data on heterozygous, thus the increment of IL-6 seem to be related to cells external or internal conditions.</p><p>Sequences over the edited regions are now included, for both SG-505 deletion and RP11 deletion, as mentioned in the response to reviewer 1&#x02019;s comments. Cells used (as mentioned in the methods and now explicitly mentioned in the results section) were HEK293T. Copy number values over the RP11 region are normal (diploid) according to ENCODE/HAIB HEK293 data (track accessible through the UCSC browser hg19 build). Expression findings (loss of RP11 expression in heterozygotes) are also consistent with a de facto KO of the transcript. As for variability, indeed we did observe that the absolute fold value changes did vary somewhat across sets of experiments (typically performed in sets of 3), perhaps reflecting particular experimental noise (basal expression of IL6 and RP11, cell density variability etc..). Still, the overall trend is strongly consistent: the relative ability to induce IL6 and RP11 by the various sgRNA.</p><p>9) In the Figure 6 is not clear why the authors did choose the SRP14 as a control. Moreover, they changed the relative for the normalization from transfected with the trcrRNA to PPIA. It would be more linear If they normalize everything to a fixed housekeeping. In addition, the standard deviation of the RP11 values at 72h is very high, maybe the experiment should be confirmed.</p><p>Our laboratory has observed that SRP14 expression is relatively stable and is often used as a housekeeper gene by various groups. We feel its inclusion further emphasizes the (seemingly) unique link between IL6 and RP11 upregulations. The experiment has been repeated (for n=3) and is now normalized to control as suggested. This results in a smaller error bar largely due to within experiment corrections rather than the additional repeat (S.D. are not dependent on sample size, only S.E. are). .</p><p>10) Did the authors try the alignment of the IL-6 and the RP11 promoters? I will advise doing it to understand the dissimilarity between them. </p><p>Yes, as mentioned in the Discussion, extensive similarity searches between IL-6 and RP11 genes were performed but revealed no significant identity (search was done by aligning sgRNA sequences with the IL6 gene). </p><p>11) In Figure 7A, the authors want to demonstrate the inhibition effect of IL-6 transcription marking different kinases? These experiments are not clear and need to be represented in a better way. Moreover, Figure 7B can be moved to supplementary data eliminating the Ponceau panel and reducing the green background of pIKKA/B. I suggest adding a positive control if possible, for the Western Blots.</p><p>Changes have been made to facilitate comprehension. First, the figure was split in 2 distinct figures. Second, the SRP14 controls were moved to the Supplementary section. Third, additional in text clarifications were introduced in the results and figure legend.</p><p>In figure 7B (now 9), we have elected to leave the Ponceau stains as is as we feel that loading controls are important in Western blot experiments. As suggested we now include a positive control (S7 Fig) for pIkka/b performed with the same tube of Antibody and THP-1 cells, which are known to undergo increased Pikka/b during polarization into pro-inflammatory M1 stage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cellsignal.com/products/primary-antibodies/phospho-ikka-b-ser176-180-16a6-rabbit-mab/2697">https://www.cellsignal.com/products/primary-antibodies/phospho-ikka-b-ser176-180-16a6-rabbit-mab/2697</ext-link>).</p><p>12) In the sentence from line 318 to 319, the authors described that the dCas9 can bind the DNA &#x0201c;promiscuously&#x0201d;, regarding this I didn&#x02019;t see in all the experiments the usage of the dCas9 fused to activators alone, to evaluate this promiscuous behavior. Indeed, they showed only the association with trcrRNA (please clarify the identity of this construct)</p><p>The reviewer is correct, in that the promiscuous behaviour is suggested only for the trcrRNA. Binding in the absence of any RNA cofactor is possibly lower but would not as adequately control for the scaffold RNA.</p><p>13) It was previously described that lncRNA RP11 is associated with tumor differentiation [Ke Su et al. 2018, ISSN:2156-6976/ajcr0081106] and interacts in someway with IL-6 transcription. The authors should check the eventual interaction between the lncRNA with the IL-6 transcription and verify if there are more articles describing this phenomenon.</p><p>RP11-443P15.2 alluded to in the above publication is unrelated to the RP11-326A19.4 described in this manuscript. RP11 is only used for simplification. The RP11 naming scheme covers thousands of unrelated speculative transcripts from EncodeGencodeBasicV28. To dispel any possible confusion targeted references to RP11 in the Discussion part have been modified to RP11-326A19.4.</p><p>14) As a suggestion, after all the expression data using qPCR, I think it is more consistent to show an increment of the IL-6 protein. As matter of fact, it is clearly demonstrated that RNA increase is not directly associated with protein increment.</p><p>We agree and have now included ELISA data demonstrating increased IL6 in the supernatant of HEK293T in response to 48 h of CRISPRa (Fig 4B). </p><p>[NOTE: If reviewer comments were submitted as an attachment file, they will be attached to this email and accessible via the submission site.
