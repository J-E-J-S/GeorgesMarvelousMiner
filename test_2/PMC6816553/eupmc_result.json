    "Inactive fusion variants of the CRISPR-Cas9 system are increasingly being used as standard methodology to study transcription regulation. Their ability to readily manipulate the native genomic loci is particularly advantageous. In this work, we serendipitously uncover the key cytokine IL6 as an off-target of the activating derivative of CRISPR (CRISPRa) while studying RP11-326A19.4, a novel long-non coding RNA (lncRNA). Increasing RP11-326A19.4 expression in HEK293T cells via CRISPRa-mediated activation of its promoter region induced genome-wide transcriptional changes, including upregulation of IL6, an important cytokine. IL6 was increased in response to distinct sgRNA targeting the RP11-326A19.4 promoter region, suggesting specificity. Loss of the cognate sgRNA recognition sites failed to abolish CRISPRa mediated activation of IL6 however, pointing to off-target effects. Bioinformatic approaches did not reveal predicted off-target binding sites. Off-target activation of IL6 was sustained and involved low level activation of known IL6 regulators. Increased IL6 remained sensitive to further activation by TNFα, consistent with the existence of independent mechanisms. This study provides experimental evidence that CRISPRa has discrete, unpredictable off-targeting limitations that must be considered when using this emerging technology."
