Hydrophobic bacterial peptides (small proteins under 50 amino acids) have emerged as regulatory molecules that can interact with bacterial membrane proteins to modulate their activity and/or stability. Among them, the <italic>Salmonella</italic> MgtR peptide promotes the degradation of MgtC, a virulence factor involved in <italic>Salmonella</italic> intramacrophage replication, thus providing the basis for an antivirulence strategy. We demonstrate here that endogenous overproduction of MgtR reduced <italic>Salmonella</italic> replication inside macrophages and lowered MgtC protein level, whereas a peptide variant of MgtR (MgtR-S17I), which does not interact with MgtC, had no effect. We then used synthetic peptides to evaluate their action upon exogenous addition. Unexpectedly, upon addition of synthetic peptides, both MgtR and its variant MgtR-S17I reduced <italic>Salmonella</italic> intramacrophage replication and lowered MgtC and MgtB protein levels, suggesting a different mechanism of action of exogenously added peptides versus endogenously produced peptides. The synthetic peptides did not act by reducing bacterial viability. We next tested their effect on various recombinant proteins produced in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and showed that the level of several inner membrane proteins was strongly reduced upon addition of both peptides, whereas cytoplasmic or outer membrane proteins remained unaffected. Moreover, the &#x003b1;-helical structure of synthetic MgtR is important for its biological activity, whereas helix-helix interacting motif is dispensable. Cumulatively, these results provide perspectives for new antivirulence strategies with the use of peptides that act by reducing the level of inner membrane proteins, including virulence factors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Antibiotics</kwd><kwd>Infection</kwd><kwd>Bacteriology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100006342</institution-id><institution>Association Vaincre la Mucoviscidose (Vaincre la Mucoviscidos)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF20160501619/1/1/47</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Viv&#x000e8;s</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Recent studies based on genomics and natural product discovery have led to a large increase in the number and diversity of small proteins (size below 50 amino-acids, hereafter called peptides) identified to be produced by bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

The peptides may act specifically on inner membrane proteins in relation with their own localization in the inner membrane.

The MgtR-S17I peptide variant, which appears more efficient than MgtR peptide, may better insert within bacterial membrane. Importantly, these peptides act on membrane proteins without showing antibacterial activity, which contrasts with the action of classical antimicrobial peptides.

H-Rink amide ChemMatrix resin (100 micromoles, substitution 0.37&#x02009;mmol.g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, Longjumeau, France) was used to generate an amide function at the C-terminal end of all peptides. The MgtR peptide (MNRSPDKIIALIFLLISLLVLCLALWQIVF), MgtR-S17I single variant, MgtR-S17I-C22S double variant and MgtR-S17I lacking WQIVF at its C-terminal end (MgtR-S17I short) were synthesized following a double-coupling step for each amino acid (400 micromoles) activated with TBTU (500 micromoles). Additionally an acetylation step was applied at the end of each amino-acid incorporation to prevent the formation of incomplete peptides. After clivage from the resine and precipitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, the final product was resuspended in an isopropanol/water (50%/50%: vol/vol) without any purification and analysed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). MgtR and MgtR-S17I peptides were synthesized two times independently and similar results were obtained from both synthesis.

After coupling of the fluorescein, the peptide was processed as described above for the unlabeled peptide.</p><p id="Par29">For C-terminal labelling of the peptide with fluorescein, a Fmoc-Lys(Aloc)-OH amino acid was first coupled on the resin as the C-terminal amino acid and the peptide was then synthesized as previously described. The Fmoc group was kept at the N-terminal end of the peptidyl resin until the labelling of the C-terminal end with fluorescein. At the end of the synthesis, the Aloc group was thus orthogonally removed by treating the resin following the tetrakis/phenylsilane procedure as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Once deprotected, the labelling of the epsilon-amine group of the C-terminal lysine was performed with a 10 fold excess of FITC and the resin was allowed for labelling overnight.
