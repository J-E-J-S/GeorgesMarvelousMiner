    "Due to the antibiotic resistance crisis, novel therapeutic strategies need to be developed against bacterial pathogens. Hydrophobic bacterial peptides (small proteins under 50 amino acids) have emerged as regulatory molecules that can interact with bacterial membrane proteins to modulate their activity and/or stability. Among them, the Salmonella MgtR peptide promotes the degradation of MgtC, a virulence factor involved in Salmonella intramacrophage replication, thus providing the basis for an antivirulence strategy. We demonstrate here that endogenous overproduction of MgtR reduced Salmonella replication inside macrophages and lowered MgtC protein level, whereas a peptide variant of MgtR (MgtR-S17I), which does not interact with MgtC, had no effect. We then used synthetic peptides to evaluate their action upon exogenous addition. Unexpectedly, upon addition of synthetic peptides, both MgtR and its variant MgtR-S17I reduced Salmonella intramacrophage replication and lowered MgtC and MgtB protein levels, suggesting a different mechanism of action of exogenously added peptides versus endogenously produced peptides. The synthetic peptides did not act by reducing bacterial viability. We next tested their effect on various recombinant proteins produced in Escherichia coli and showed that the level of several inner membrane proteins was strongly reduced upon addition of both peptides, whereas cytoplasmic or outer membrane proteins remained unaffected. Moreover, the α-helical structure of synthetic MgtR is important for its biological activity, whereas helix-helix interacting motif is dispensable. Cumulatively, these results provide perspectives for new antivirulence strategies with the use of peptides that act by reducing the level of inner membrane proteins, including virulence factors."
