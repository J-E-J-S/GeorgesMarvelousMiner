Common workflows tend to focus on clustering core variation and representing this as a tree, to which other parameters are added to make sense of the data and system under investigation, potentially missing additional information about evolutionary and transmission processes in the pangenome. Increasingly, with ever-growing population scale datasets, the importance and dynamics of the non-core (e.g. movement of phage, plasmids and other mobile elements) needs to be assessed as a matter of routine. We demonstrate the utility of a novel machine-learning method and its ease of use via a web application for visualization. Such methods, enabling the rapid and easy identification of similarity in the non-core, and the subsequent relation of this information to core phylogenies and other epidemiological and relevant system-level metadata, will aid our understanding of the dynamics within the pangenome, and shed further light on, for example, host, niche and pathogenic adaptation.</p></boxed-text></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1-4"><title>Introduction</title><p>In less than a decade, bacterial population genomics has progressed from the sequencing of dozens to thousands of strains [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;4</xref>]. The biological insights enabled by population genomics are particularly important in evolutionary epidemiology, as the genome sequences provide high-resolution data for the estimation of transmission and evolutionary dynamics, including the horizontal transfer of virulence and resistance elements. Phylogenetic trees are the main tool utilized for visualization and exploration of population genomic data, both in terms of the level of relatedness of strains and for mapping relevant metadata such as geographical locations and host characteristics [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. While trees are very useful, they are in general estimated using only core-genome variation (i.e. those regions of the genome common to all members of a sample), which may represent only a fraction of the relevant differences present in genomes across the study population. Several recent studies highlight the importance of considering variation in gene content when investigating the ecological and evolutionary processes leading to the observed data [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6, 7</xref>].</p><p>The rapidly increasing size of population genomic datasets calls for efficient visualization methods to explore patterns of relatedness based on core-genomic polymorphisms, accessory gene content, epidemiological, geographical and other metadata. Here, we introduce a framework that integrates within the web application Microreact [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], by utilizing a popular unsupervised machine-learning technique for big data to infer neighbours of bacterial strains from accessory gene content data and to efficiently visualize the resulting relationships. The machine-learning method, called t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding), has already gained widespread popularity for exploring image, video and textual data [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8, 9</xref>], but has to our knowledge not yet been widely utilized for bacterial population genomics.</p><p>Since gene content may in general be rapidly altered in bacteria, it provides a high-resolution evolutionary marker of relatedness that can extend far beyond core-genome mutations [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Different processes driving horizontal movement of DNA, such as homologous recombination, conjugative transfer of plasmids and phage infections, all affect the gene content within and outside of a chromosome. By contrasting core and non-core gene content, one can investigate and draw conclusions about genome dynamics across a sample collection. Here, we demonstrate the biological utility of such an approach by application to multiple population data sets.</p></sec><sec id="s1-5"><title>Methods and Results</title><p>t-SNE is a machine-learning algorithm that is widely used for data visualization [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is suitable for embedding a set of high-dimensional data items in a two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional space. The embedding approximately preserves the pairwise similarities between the data items.</p><p>The t-SNE algorithm consists of two main steps. First, it calculates the similarities between the data items in the high-dimensional space, which is typically based on normal distribution around each data item. The similarities are then normalized to be probabilities (i.e. they sum to one). Similarities in the low-dimensional space are analogously defined and normalized except that Student's <italic>t</italic>-distribution replaces the Gaussians. Second, t-SNE minimizes Kullback&#x02013;Leibler divergence between the two probability matrices over the embedding coordinates. Finally, the 2D t-SNE result can be visualized as a scatter plot where each dot indicates a data item.</p><p>t-SNE as an unsupervised method is particularly useful for exploratory data analysis. It has a wide range of applications in music analysis, cancer research, computer security research, bioinformatics and biomedical signal processing. In many cases, t-SNE is able to identify meaningful data structures such as clusters even without feature engineering or structural assumptions, e.g. about number of clusters underlying the data, even in cases where Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been demonstrated to fail. Here, we use the latest version of the t-SNE projection method, adopting the Barnes&#x02013;Hut algorithm for accelerating the divergence minimization [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. To demonstrate utility within population genomics, firstly, we explore how the method performs in a simulated setting, where the relationship between all sequences is known; and then we extend our analysis to published bacterial population data sets, allowing us to uncover previously unseen relationships between data and to address important biological questions.</p><sec id="s2-5-1"><title>Simulated data</title><p>To validate the methodology, we assessed how well it identified neighbours and clusters for simulated genetic sequences. Firstly, we randomly generated multiple synthetic datasets of related isolates, with each defined as a sequence of present/absent genes. Each dataset was generated using the following parameters. (1) There were 20 clusters as underlying subpopulations. (2) The number of isolates belonging to a cluster was drawn from a Poisson distribution with mean 15. (3) Each cluster was defined by a number of core genes, which ranged uniformly from 1 to 100. (4) Each isolate had a probability between 80 and 99&#x0200a;% of independently carrying each of the core genes of the cluster it belonged to. (5) Conversely, each isolate had a probability (PN) to independently carry each of the non-core genes of its cluster. Non-core genes were composed of core genes of other clusters and &#x02018;noise&#x02019; genes that were not defining characteristics of any cluster (in total 300 genes).</p><p>Each generated dataset had on average 300 isolates with a gene content of 1300 genes present/absent on average. For each dataset, we estimated the genetic pairwise Hamming distance (d<sub>H</sub>) and the distance using the t-SNE algorithm (d<sub>t</sub>). The Hamming distance here was simply the number of differences between two binary sequences, where each element was an indicator for whether a particular gene was present in an isolate or not. The implementation of the t-SNE algorithm that we used yields a coordinate in a 2D plane for each isolate, and we calculated the distance d<sub>t</sub> simply as the Euclidean distance for each pair of isolates.</p><p>If a cluster is sufficiently differentiable in terms of its gene content, we expect the Hamming distance within the cluster to be smaller than to any other isolate not belonging to it. For the t-SNE algorithm to be considered valid, it should be able to project the isolates from the same cluster on the 2D plane sufficiently close together so that the Euclidean distance within the cluster is smaller than to any other isolate. Given the conditions that were used to generate the synthetic datasets, not all clusters were necessarily differentiable in terms of their gene content; therefore, we classified the t-SNE algorithm as performing erroneously only when a pair of isolates belonging to a different cluster were not identified as such by the algorithm but were correctly identified using the Hamming distance. For high levels of noise, i.e. a large value of probability (PN), differentiating the clusters using their gene content becomes increasingly difficult as the isolates may lack a sufficiently stable signal of relatedness.</p><p>We analysed the performance of the t-SNE algorithm for three levels of noise PN, 0.001, 0.005 and 0.01, which measured the mean proportion of non-core genes in each isolate. We performed 100 repeats for each noise value, which for each repeat involved generating on average 300 sequences and comparing almost 45&#x0200a;000 pairs of isolates. The mean error for the three noise values was 0.5, 1 and 4&#x0200a;%, respectively, with a small error representing a particular isolate mis-allocated (i.e. very close to a different cluster) and a large error representing two clusters that were not appropriately differentiated by the t-SNE algorithm, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>. The error of the t-SNE algorithm increases with the noise, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>(iii), and with the total number of clusters (not shown).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Illustration of a simulated dataset, with the isolates&#x02019; gene content (left), black dots indicate the presence of a gene, the <italic>x</italic>-axis represents all the considered genes (a total of 1213 genes in this simulation).

The difference between IcB and IcC is technical, rather than biological: all IcB isolates were sequenced early in the project with 54 nt reads, whereas most IcC isolates were sequenced with 75 nt reads. Unusually for pneumococci, the isolates in both these groups were trilysogenic, carrying prophage similar to &#x003d5;670-6B.1 and &#x003d5;670-6B.2, found in the <italic><named-content content-type="species"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1601/nm.5677">Streptococcus pneumoniae</ext-link></named-content></italic> 670-6B genome inserted between <italic>dnaN</italic> and <italic>pth</italic> (<italic>att</italic><sub>670</sub>), and within the <italic>comYC</italic> gene (<italic>att</italic><sub>comYC</sub>), respectively; and a prophage isolated from 0211+13275, inserted at SPN23F15280 &#x02013; SPN23F15810 (<italic>att</italic><sub>MM1</sub>) [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The apparent rapid acquisition, and stable maintenance, of multiple viral loci may relate to the abrogation of these bacteria&#x02019;s competence system by the insertion of prophage &#x003d5;IC1 into <italic>comYC</italic> [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11, 17</xref>]. Group IcD, interspersed with IcB and IcC within clade IC1 in the phylogeny, differs in the absence of prophage similar to &#x003d5;670-6B.2. IcE, also polyphyletic within clade IC1, differed in having lost the region of pneumococcal pathogenicity island 1 (PPI-1) that encodes the <italic>pia</italic> iron-transport operon, which plays a role in pneumococcal pathogenesis in animal models [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Hence, it is not surprising to find these isolates were only recovered from sputum, otitis media samples or nasopharyngeal swabs.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Analysis of the <italic><named-content content-type="species"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1601/nm.5677">Streptococcus pneumoniae</ext-link></named-content></italic> PMEN2 lineage.

These all represented cases where t-SNE grouped isolates that were disparate in terms of their country and year of isolation, as well as having a polyphyletic distribution across the whole genome phylogeny. These groupings represented cases of convergent evolution through parallel acquisition very similar prophage. Group IntA lacked any prophage similar to those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3(c</xref>); group IntB had prophage with some similarity to both prophage in the reference genome; group IntC only had a prophage with similarity to &#x003d5;0211+13275; whereas group IntD had prophage similar to &#x003d5;0211+13&#x0200a;275&#x02009;and &#x003d5;670-6B.1 as well. Hence, the rapid movement of prophage sequences within lineages [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] clearly substantially contributes to the changes in gene content observed over short timescales. <sc>panini</sc> facilitates rapid analysis of these diverse elements, and their complex relationship with bacterial population structure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-5-6"><title>Mobile element and serotype variation in a vaccine-escape lineage</title><sec id="s3-5-6-1"><title>Data visualization and download</title><p>Data are available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://microreact.org/project/panini-pmen14?ui=nt">https://microreact.org/project/panini-pmen14?ui=nt</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5-6-2"><title>Source data and .RTab file</title><p>Source data and the .RTab file are available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gitlab.com/cgps/panini/datasets/tree/master/PMEN14">https://gitlab.com/cgps/panini/datasets/tree/master/PMEN14</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5-6-3"><title>Mobile element and serotype variation</title><p><sc>panini</sc> was similarly applied to 176 isolates of the multidrug-resistant <italic><named-content content-type="species"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1601/nm.5677">Streptococcus pneumoniae</ext-link></named-content></italic> PMEN14 lineage [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although the sequences came from many countries, the collection was strongly enriched for bacteria from the Maela refugee camp in Thailand [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which fell into five clades (ML1&#x02013;ML5), of which ML2 was the largest. The groups identified by <sc>panini</sc> were again polyphyletic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), with ML2 split up in a similar manner to the PMEN2 clade IC1. This was again driven by the distribution of prophage sequence: group 1 isolates were free of prophage, whereas group 2 isolates were infected with a &#x02018;group 2-type&#x02019; prophage, and group 3 isolates were infected with a similar, but distinct, &#x02018;group 3-type&#x02019; prophage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Clade ML2 isolates in group 4 were distinguished by variation in another mobile genetic element, a phage-related chromosomal island (PRCI), shared by most of the isolates. This PRCI was absent from these assemblies, either because at least part of the element had been lost through deletion, due to replacement with a related sequence (isolate 6259_1-15) or due to the acquisition of a second, highly similar PRCI that prevented effective assembly of either (isolates 6237_8-12, 6237_8-13 and 6237_8-18). In this latter case, mapping to the element was still evident.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Analysis of the <italic><named-content content-type="species"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1601/nm.5677">Streptococcus pneumoniae</ext-link></named-content></italic> PMEN14 lineage.

(b) Variation in accessory loci associated with differential classification of isolates into groups. This heatmap is displayed as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>. In this case, the sequence loci across the top are more functionally diverse. The first is the <italic>neuB</italic> coding sequence with an IS<italic>Spn</italic>8 element inserted into it. The lack of mapping to the middle of this column indicates the absence of this insertion sequence anywhere in the chromosome. The next loci are alternative alleles of the capsule polysaccharide synthesis locus, one encoding for the biosynthesis of the PCV7 type 19F polysaccharide, the other for the non-PCV7 type 19A polysaccharide. These are followed by two similar prophage, one associated with group 2 isolates, the other with group 3 isolates; the similarity between these two viruses means there is extensive mapping to both, even when an isolate only contains one of them. The PRCI absent from the assemblies of group 4 isolates is next; mapping suggests this is actually present in some, but <sc>panini</sc> nevertheless included them in this group because the acquisition of a further, related PRCI prevented either assembling accurately. This is followed by the Tn<italic>916</italic> conjugative element, absent from the group 5 isolates, which possess genomic islands encoding for the biosynthesis of a lantibiotic and a restriction-modification system, included at the right-hand end of the panel.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mgen-5-220-g004"/></fig><p>A fifth group, which did not include any Maela isolates, corresponded to the antibiotic-susceptible outgroup isolates. These differed through the absence of a third type of mobile element, the Tn<italic>916</italic> integrative and conjugative element, an antibiotic resistance-encoding genomic island that was absent from these &#x02018;outgroup&#x02019; isolates. Additionally, these bacteria shared two smaller genomic islands, encoding putative lantibiotic biosynthesis and restriction-modification operons, which were absent from the multidrug-resistant isolates. Variation in other non-mobile element islands was also detectable. The group 1-19A subcluster contained isolates of serotype 19A, produced through two independent serotype switching recombinations at the capsule polysaccharide synthesis (<italic>cps</italic>) locus that resulted in genotypes &#x02018;19A ST320&#x02019; and &#x02018;19A ST236&#x02019;. These changes were responsible for allowing isolates to evade the seven-valent polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (PCV7), which targeted the lineage&#x02019;s ancestral serotype 19F, expressed by almost all the rest of the collection [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A smaller serotype switching recombination, which did not replace the entire serotype-determining <italic>cps</italic> locus, generated the &#x02018;19A ST271&#x02019; isolates [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

As many bacteria have varied accessory genomes, changes in the gene content can offer a way to identify epidemiologically or evolutionarily important clues about the evolutionary processes affecting a pathogen&#x02019;s spread. As we have illustrated here, such information is most useful when clustering is combined within a phylogeographical approach, and visualized jointly in a seamless fashion enabling the rapid interpretation of core and non-core clustering in the context of where and when data were collected.</p><p>The t-SNE algorithm is a very efficient approach to cluster isolates based on their gene content. In the simulated scenarios considering synthetic data, the errors in clustering always remained small, either representing an isolate allocated to a wrong cluster or two clusters that were merged. However, this only occurred in simulations with the &#x02018;noise&#x02019; level much higher than expected in nature. In general, what we defined as &#x02018;core&#x02019; genes in a cluster rarely appear in isolates not belonging to the cluster, and if they do, it is typically at much lower frequencies than those we considered. Furthermore, in our synthetic datasets, we formed clusters defined by as few as a single core gene. These clusters with a limited number of core genes, combined with relatively high levels of &#x02018;noise&#x02019;, are in practice almost completely indistinguishable from others, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> (iii &#x02013; clusters K, L, O and Q). Overall, our simulated datasets are conservative, as the gene absence and presence variation is higher than expected in natural populations, and therefore indicate that the t-SNE is a promising approach for rapidly and accurately clustering bacteria based on gene content. Nevertheless, it is important to be aware that issues with gene calling may in some cases influence the accuracy of <sc>panini</sc> due to for example different alleles of a gene being assigned as separate genes in a Roary analysis. Consequently, unless using expert-curated pangenomes, we advise a user to test multiple Roary thresholds to see whether the <sc>panini</sc> results with the corresponding different Roary outputs are robust with respect to small changes in the threshold.</p><p>When applied to a population-wide genomic dataset, the algorithm was clearly able to identify distinct lineages within a diverse collection. This analysis could highlight which clusters, defined using the core genome, could be sensibly subdivided, and which small groups within a diverse set of strains could be justifiably regarded as new clusters. Within lineages, the same congruence between core and accessory genomes across clades was not observed. Instead, clusters were distinguished by rapidly occurring, homoplasic alterations, such as phage infection. In this context, <sc>panini</sc> provides an intuitive way in which to understand the distribution of rapidly evolving aspects of the genome, which are difficult to analyse in a conventional phylogenetic framework. <sc>panini</sc> is, therefore, a promising platform through which biologically important changes in bacterial gene content can be uncovered at all levels of evolutionary, ecological and epidemiological analyses. To quantify properties of the inferred neighbourhood structure as a function of different underlying biological processes in closer detail by simulation will be an interesting topic for future research.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Funding information</title><p>The development of <sc>panini</sc> was funded by the Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance, Wellcome Trust grant no. 099202 and MRC grant no.
