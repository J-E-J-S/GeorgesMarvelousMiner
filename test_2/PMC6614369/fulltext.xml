Drugs to selectively inhibit CR circuitry are of high interest for cancer treatment. In alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, PAX3-FOXO1 activates SEs to induce the expression of other CR TFs, providing a model system for studying cancer cell addiction to CR transcription. Using chemical genetics, the systematic screening of chemical matter for a biological outcome, here we report on a screen for epigenetic chemical probes able to distinguish between SE-driven transcription and constitutive transcription. We find that chemical probes along the acetylation-axis, and not the methylation-axis, selectively disrupt CR transcription. Additionally, we find that histone deacetylases (HDACs)&#x000a0;are essential for CR TF transcription. We further dissect the contribution of HDAC isoforms using selective inhibitors, including the newly developed selective HDAC3 inhibitor LW3.

Selective inhibition of transcription of MYC and other key oncogenic TFs has been achieved by inhibition of acetyl-lysine reader (bromodomain)-containing proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.

While most TFs are expressed at low levels and are not particularly attractive drug targets, a small set of super enhancer (SE)-driven TFs form strong autoregulatory circuitry, the core regulatory (CR) TFs, and are essential for cancer growth. Often pan-cancer oncogenes, such as the MYC family of proteins, form a part of the CR circuitry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, in addition to lineage-specific TFs inherited from the cell of origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Here, we sought to identify small molecules capable of selectively disabling CR circuitry, using PAX3-FOXO1 fusion oncogene positive rhabdomyosarcoma (FP-RMS) as a model system. Using both large agnostic screening (63,000 compounds) and 77 mechanistically curated epigenetic and transcriptional probes, we report SE-driven transcription has a rapid and selective dependence on readers, writers, and erasers of histone acetylation, while small molecule modulators of histone methylation have almost no impact within a 24&#x02009;h window. RNA-seq screening further confirmed that acetylation-axis-perturbing probes selectively ablate transcription of CR networks, while methylation-axis probes do not. Bromodomains, which assemble to the genome by binding the acetyl-lysine histone scaffold associated with active enhancers and promoters, are essential for CR TF-dependent transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, we discovered histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes which remove acetylation are also essential for CR transcription, exposing a new mechanism underlying the long appreciated phenotypic consequences of chemical probes inhibiting the enzymatic activity of various HDAC isoforms. We utilized a set of HDAC selective chemical probes, including a newly developed HDAC3 selective inhibitor, to dissect the contributions of zinc-dependent HDACs to CR TF transcriptional control.&#x000a0;We uncovered that nuclear Class I HDACs 1, 2, and 3 but not HDAC8 are co-essential for CR transcription, and simultaneous inhibition of HDAC1/2/3 disrupts CR TF chromatin architecture.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemical probes expose SE vulnerabilities</title><p id="Par5">CR TFs bind in a combinatorial fashion to create large protein aggregates at the interface of a gene promoter and usually several long-distance regulatory elements, forming a &#x0201c;super enhancer&#x0201d;, which are now known to form large multivalent phase condensates.

These inhibitors were assayed for the dose responsiveness of a constitutive CMV promoter driven and the SE-driven luciferase. Responses were considered inactive if &#x0003e;60% of the SE luciferase remained; SE inhibition responses were then divided into three categories based on comparison to CMV response: general transcriptional inhibition (SE &#x02264;&#x02009;60%, &#x02264;30% difference between SE and CMV), SE selective (SE &#x02264;&#x02009;60%, CMV &#x02264;&#x02009;170%), and SE down CMV up (SE &#x02264;&#x02009;60%, CMV &#x0003e;&#x02009;170%).

HDAC inhibitors, well known for their ability to increase expression of many genes, caused an increase in CMV induction, while at the same doses caused complete disruption of SE output (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). This HDAC inhibition of SE activity was also disrupted prior to cell death, whereas transcriptionally unselective inhibitors were only able to shutdown SE activity at concentrations causing cell death (cf., LSD1 inhibitor LSD690, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>) suggesting an indirect effect.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Large-scale transcriptional screen for SE-selectivity</title><p id="Par9">Upon validating the ability of our cell-based system to rank small molecules for selective SE transcriptional impact, we extended it to a library of largely uncharacterized pure-compounds.

Since the goal of the assay was to identify druggable SE dependencies, an on-target effect of N1302 would predict nuclear-localized HDAC isoforms, such as HDAC2, binding to SEs. Therefore, we sought to define the localization of HDAC2 in relation to SEs and CR TFs in the same FP-RMS cell line used for screening (RH4).

To validate this we performed ChIP-seq of all three isoforms individually, and analyzed their binding profiles genome wide, finding a near complete co-occurrence of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 at locations bound by CR TFs, with most consistent overlap at CR TF sites in SEs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>). Since the inhibition of all three co-bound HDACs should increase acetylation, HDAC1&#x02013;3 inhibition should also increase chromatin accessibility at CR TF sites. Thus, we performed ATAC-seq on RH4 cells after 1 or 6&#x02009;h of HDAC1/2/3 inhibition with Entinostat, and observed that indeed, sites in SEs that are bound by all five CR TFs (MYOD1, MYOG, SOX8, PAX3-FOXO1, and MYCN), which are co-bound by HDACs (bioinformatically defined by HDAC2 ChIP-seq as a representative for all three), underwent a dramatic increase in local accessibility (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5h</xref>).

In such an instance, an increase in pore size to 100&#x02009;nm would triple the volume and dilute chromatin-associated factor concentrations. Aberrant new contacts would increase, while endogenous, transcription-supportive interactions would be diluted.

This lineage-specifying circuitry is hijacked to become oncogenic-circuitry in cancer. Drugging transcription of CR TFs may be more tractable in principle than direct inhibition of TF proteins in many disease states. Indeed, our data here suggests that transcriptional depletion of CR TFs underlies the effect of many epigenetic chemical probes, especially along the histone acetylation axis (BET proteins, HATs, and HDACs).</p><p id="Par18">We have shown here, using chemical genomics, that Class I HDACs (1, 2, and 3 but not HDAC8) are essential to CR transcription and cell proliferation. The auto-regulatory nature of CR TFs makes their universal depletion via chemical perturbation a self-reinforcing collapse. This likely contributes to why CR TFs have the most complete depletion. As this CR collapse is seen by inhibiting lysine acetylation writers (CPB/p300), erasers (HDACs), or readers (BRD2/3/4), these could be thought of as three distinct mechanisms: acetylation constriction (HATi), acetylation bloating (HDACi), or acetylation mimic-distraction (BRDi). As HDACi and HATi have the same (and not reverse) impact on CR transcription, we consider that both are required to strike a balance of acetylation state, which agrees with the observation that p300 and HDACs occupy the same locations on the epigenome (and, positively correlate)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par19">While NuRD is known as a repressive complex, and is involved in enhancer decommissioning during ESC differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, in RMS cancer cells HDAC is required for transcription of the most active CR TFs, and shows a greater selectivity for CR TF transcription than other strategies such as BRD4 or CDK7 inhibition. BRD4 itself is capable of ejecting nucleosomes by acetylating H3K122<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, yet we cannot exclude the possibility that ATP-dependent remodelers with acetylation-reader domains (e.g. components of the BAF complex PBTM, BRG, BRD7/9) are responsible for local increases in accessibility. However, HDACi-induced chromatin spreading and increase in nuclear size does not depend on ATP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Thus, we suggest that the altered local electrostatics of hyper-acetylated histones, with an average of 17 positively charged residues neutralized by acetylation per octamer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, leads to inherently more open nucleosome scaffolds.
