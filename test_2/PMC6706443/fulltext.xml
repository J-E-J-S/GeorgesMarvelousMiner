In this study, we investigate the oncogenic role of PPM1D, a protein phosphatase often found truncated in pediatric gliomas such as DIPG, and uncover a synthetic lethal interaction between <italic>PPM1D</italic> mutations and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibition. Specifically, we show that mutant PPM1D drives hypermethylation of CpG islands throughout the genome and promotes epigenetic silencing of nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT), a key gene involved in NAD biosynthesis. Notably, <italic>PPM1D</italic> mutant cells are shown to be sensitive to NAMPT inhibitors in vitro and in vivo, within both engineered isogenic astrocytes and primary patient-derived model systems, suggesting the possible application of NAMPT inhibitors for the treatment of pediatric gliomas. Overall, our results reveal a promising approach for the targeting of <italic>PPM1D</italic> mutant tumors, and define a critical link between oncogenic driver mutations and NAD metabolism, which can be exploited for tumor-specific cell killing.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Mutations in the Protein Phosphatase PPM1D are oncogenic in certain cancers including diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG).

Since its discovery over 20 years ago, <italic>PPM1D</italic> has become a well-established oncogene, found amplified or over-expressed in a diverse range of cancers, including breast, ovarian, gastrointestinal, and brain cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Truncation mutations in the C-terminus of PPM1D were subsequently identified in a subset of cancers, most notably in pediatric gliomas, including diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. These mutations markedly enhance the stability of PPM1D, increasing its total overall phosphatase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Despite characterization of the cellular function of this important enzyme, there remains much to be understood about the role of PPM1D in tumorigenesis. To compound this, there are no isogenic glial cell lines that contain PPM1D-truncating mutations, limiting the ability to study the specific consequences of these genomic events in the formation of gliomas. Finally, while a number of PPM1D inhibitors have been developed as promising experimental tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, their success in vitro has not translated into the clinic, exposing an important and unmet clinical need.</p><p id="Par4">Here we describe the creation and validation of PPM1D-truncated isogenic astrocyte cell lines for use in studying the role of these mutations in gliomagenesis. Through a targeted synthetic lethal drug screen, we demonstrate that <italic>PPM1D</italic> mutant astrocytes and patient-derived <italic>PPM1D</italic> mutant DIPG lines are particularly sensitive to treatment with nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibitors. Finally, we show that this mutant PPM1D-induced NAMPT inhibitor sensitivity is driven by hypermethylation of CpG islands throughout the genome, and in particular, the epigenetic silencing of nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT), a key gene involved in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis. These findings provide important insights into the biological effects of truncating PPM1D mutations, and uncover unique vulnerabilities associated with enhanced PPM1D activity which can be exploited for the therapeutic intervention of mutant pediatric brain tumors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>PPM1D mutant astrocytes are sensitive to NAMPT inhibitors</title><p id="Par5">To develop <italic>PPM1D</italic> mutant models for subsequent biological investigations, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing to create isogenic immortalized human astrocytes harboring endogenous <italic>PPM1D</italic> truncation mutations (PPM1D<sup>trncs.</sup>). The heterozygous, truncating mutations were introduced into exon 6 of the <italic>PPM1D</italic> locus, at C-terminal locations similar to those found in DIPGs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). We then isolated single cell PPM1D<sup>trnc.</sup> clones and confirmed the presence of frameshifting mutations that encode truncated PPM1D proteins (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). As expected, truncated PPM1D was highly expressed in mutant cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) and maintained a substantially longer half-life compared to the wild type (WT), full-length form of the protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>). The increased PPM1D protein stability correlated with enhanced phosphatase activity as seen by the active dephosphorylation of key PPM1D targets, &#x003b3;H2AX and pCHK2 (T68), measured by western blot (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>) and &#x003b3;H2AX foci formation assays (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>), after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR).

This screen identified a synthetic lethal interaction between <italic>PPM1D</italic> mutations and the NAMPT inhibitor, FK866<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>; Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). This unexpected NAMPT inhibitor sensitivity was confirmed in three different PPM1D<sup>trnc.</sup> cell lines (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>), as well as by three structurally distinct NAMPT inhibitors: STF31, GPP78, and STF118804 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref>; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d</xref>), corroborating our initial finding and establishing that this effect is a result of on-target inhibition of NAMPT activity. Furthermore, stable overexpression of either WT or mutant PPM1D in the parental astrocyte cell line (PPM1D OE<sup>FL</sup> or OE<sup>trnc.</sup>, respectively<italic>)</italic>, was sufficient to confer FK866 synthetic lethality, confirming that this interaction is driven specifically by an increased total activity of PPM1D, and not a neomorphic role of the mutant protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1j</xref>; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1e&#x02013;g</xref>). Additionally, expression of a phosphatase dead mutant (PPM1D D314A), did not result in FK866 sensitivity in our astrocyte models, further verifying the dependence on increased PPM1D activity for the induction of this synthetic lethality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Reduced NAD levels in PPM1D<sup>trncs.</sup> drive NAMPTi sensitivity</title><p id="Par7">Next, we sought to investigate the molecular basis for mutant PPM1D-induced NAMPT inhibitor (NAMPTi) synthetic lethality. NAMPT catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the salvage of nicotinamide (NAM) to form NAD (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Thus, we wished to quantify the NAD metabolome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, within our WT and PPM1D<sup>trnc.</sup> astrocyte models to better understand potential variations in this important metabolic pathway. We found that <italic>PPM1D</italic> mutations induce a substantial depression of many NAD-related metabolites, including a significant reduction in NAD and NADP levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b, c</xref>; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). As maintenance of these two cofactors is important for cellular bioenergetics and proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, we examined the effect of NAMPT inhibition on the quantities of both NAD and NADP, as well as on cell viability. While cellular pools of both NAD and NADP dropped markedly in FK866-treated WT astrocytes, the decline was significantly greater in the PPM1D<sup>trnc.</sup> cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>), indicating an enhanced dependence on NAMPT activity in the setting of mutant PPM1D. We then tested whether nicotinamide riboside (NR) could bypass NAMPT inhibition and thus, rescue the levels of NAD in PPM1D<sup>trnc.</sup> astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Indeed, NR treatment sufficiently increased basal NAD levels (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c, d</xref>), and completely mitigated the cytotoxic effects of FK866 in PPM1D<sup>trnc.</sup> cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2e, f</xref>). Similar results were found upon exogenous treatment of NAM, which strongly antagonized FK866 cytotoxicity in PPM1D<sup>trnc.</sup> cells (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2g&#x02013;i</xref>). Interestingly, exogenous treatment with NA did not prevent FK866-induced cell death, indicating a potential metabolic defect in the Preiss Handler salvage pathway (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2j&#x02013;l</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that mutant PPM1D induces a depression of the NAD metabolome and especially NAD levels, which can be further potentiated by NAMPT inhibition, resulting in the selective killing of <italic>PPM1D</italic> mutant cells.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Mutant PPM1D-induced NAPRT deficiency drives sensitivity to NAMPT inhibition. <bold>a</bold> Graphic model of enzymes (red) and metabolites (black) involved in NAD biosynthesis.

Additional NAPRT siRNAs were used to confirm these findings and further revealed a strong correlation between the degree of NAPRT knockdown and FK866 sensitivity (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b, c</xref>). NAPRT plays a complementary role to NAMPT in the production of NAD, and previous studies have inversely correlated NAPRT expression with NAMPT inhibitor sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, we found that NAPRT protein expression was undetectable in our PPM1D<sup>trnc.</sup> and PPM1D overexpressing (OE<sup>FL</sup> and OE<sup>trnc.</sup>) cell lines (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>). To determine if this critical deficiency resulted in NAMPT inhibitor sensitivity, we reintroduced NAPRT into PPM1D<sup>trnc.</sup> cells. Stable, ectopic expression of NAPRT completely rescued the cytotoxicity caused by NAMPT inhibition and mirrored the resistance found commonly in WT cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3d, e</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that mutant PPM1D drives a loss of NAPRT expression, which ultimately induces profound NAMPT inhibitor sensitivity.</p><p id="Par9">To complement our work in immortalized, normal human astrocytes, we then tested whether our findings could be recapitulated in more clinically relevant tumor models. To this end, we examined NAPRT expression in a collection of previously described, patient-derived DIPG spheroid cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

Similar to the PPM1D<sup>trnc.</sup> astrocytes, we found that SU-DIPG-XXXV also completely lacked NAPRT gene expression. This deficiency was unique in the DIPG cell panel as the remaining WT lines maintained high levels of NAPRT expression. Consistent with our findings in immortalized astrocytes, SU-DIPG-XXXV was also extremely sensitive to FK866 treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2j, k</xref>) with cytotoxic doses in the low, single-digit nanomolar range. In contrast, the three WT DIPG lines were resistant to FK866 treatment, highlighting the dependence of NAMPT inhibitor sensitivity on <italic>PPM1D</italic> mutation status. Notably, culturing these DIPG cell lines in growth media devoid of nicotinic acid (NA) induced a strong sensitivity to FK866 in all SU-DIPG spheroid cultures tested (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4c</xref>), confirming the importance of alternative NAD biosynthesis pathways such as NA salvage, in mediating NAMPT inhibitor synthetic lethality in gliomas.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Epigenetic events silence NAPRT expression in PPM1D mutant models</title><p id="Par10">Next we sought to identify the mechanism by which mutant PPM1D suppresses NAPRT expression.

It has previously been shown that a loss of occupancy of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac is associated with an increase in site-specific DNA methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

Thus, we considered the possibility that mutant PPM1D induces silencing of the <italic>NAPRT</italic> gene by regulating DNA methylation at its promoter. To test this hypothesis, we immunoprecipitated and quantified methylated and hydroxymethylated cytosine bases from within the <italic>NAPRT</italic> promoter, using Me-DIP and hMe-DIP assays respectively.

Methylation results from the Illumina Human EPIC Bead Array (850&#x02009;k) revealed a substantial increase in CpG island hypermethylation across all <italic>PPM1D</italic> mutant cell lines tested. Of the 390 most significant variable probes (SVPs), 287 (74%) were hypermethylated in <italic>PPM1D</italic> mutant lines (PPM1D<sup>trnc.</sup>, PPM1D<sup>OE</sup>, SU-DIPG-XXXV, HSJD-DIPG-007, HSJD-DIPG-008, and HSJD-DIPG-14b), compared to only 103 (26%) hypermethylated in WT cell lines (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). In addition, individual probes within the <italic>NAPRT</italic> locus were subsequently identified and analyzed from this data set.
