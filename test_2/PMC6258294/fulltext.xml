It has been well established that endogenous miRNAs could degrade or silence mRNAs to mediate gene expression by binding RNA-induced silencing complex (RICS) in a sequence-specific manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Meanwhile, although still controversial, new hypotheses about extracellular miRNA have been continually proposed, e.g., exosomal miRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], circulating miRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and exogenous miRNA (xenomiR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Due to the possibility of cross-kingdom regulation, plant-derived xenomiR hypothesis has received great attention since first proposed in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Plant-derived xenomiRs were defined as the miRNAs derived from plants which are capable of transferring into human or animal bodies. Subsequently, plant-derived xenomiRs have been detected in different tissues or body fluids of several species of animals, including human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], pig [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], panda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and silkworm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. And their relevance to many diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], chronic-inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], benign prostatic hyperplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and pulmonary fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], were also proposed. However, many mechanisms of plant-derived xenomiRs in keeping stable in gastrointestinal (GI) track, transferring across GI track, entering cells or being secreted by cells are still unknown. Of note, negative results have also been reported in some biological experiments and computational analyses, making this issue very contentious. Some biological experiments-based studies claimed the plant-derived miRNAs detected in animal samples were contamination during experiments instead of bona fide xenomiRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Of interest, exogenous non-diet derived miRNAs were detected in insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and it has been argued that plant miRNAs in animals are artefactual due to sequencing methodology. Some computational analyses also showed that plant-derived xenomiRs were divergent from reality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. For instance, Tosar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] reported the amount of plant miRNAs in 3 human spermatozoa samples reached extreme, biologically meaningless level. Though it is still a controversial issue, the new findings about xenomiRs never stop. Emerging evidence suggests that the species of plant miRNAs detected in animals are limited, although the total species of miRNAs of a single plant is often more than several hundred, for example&#x000a0;713 species of miRNAs have been identified in <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (osa) so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Only 25 species of plant miRNAs were detected by Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], although their samples pooled 80 human serum (8 samples, each sample pooled from 10 humans). In another study of Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], where plant miRNAs in human plasma were examined by qRT-PCR after donors had drunk fruit juice, 10 species of plant miRNAs were detected, whereas 16 species of plant miRNAs could be detected in the fruit juice. Similarly, limited species of maize miRNAs were detected using qRT-PCR in the serum and tissues of pigs feed with fresh maize for 7&#x02009;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. With TA-cloning and Sanger sequencing, only a part of species of mulberry-derived miRNAs were detected in hemolymphs of silkworms which were fed with mulberry leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">In fact, besides natural plant miRNAs, many species of synthetic plant miRNAs or mimic plant miRNAs that are identical or similar to natural plant miRNAs, were also reported to be able to transfer into and keep stable in animal bodies. Chin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] suggested that both natural plant miR159 and synthetic oligos, with the same sequence as miR159, were capable of transferring into human breast cancer cells. Similarly, the synthetic miR166b were detected in silkworm hemolymph [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A recent study reported that 3 species of mimic plant miRNAs (mmu-miR34a, mmu-miR143 and mmu-miR145) can also transfer into mouse body by oral administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Many reports suggested that MIR2911 could be significantly taken in by human and animals, which was attributed to its unique sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and the disruption of the MIR2911 sequence by two nucleotides abolished its absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Yang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] suggested that not all miRNAs, but miRNAs with certain features could keep stable in GI tract of animals, and randomly synthesized miRNA-like sequences would be degraded quickly after injected in animals.</p><p id="Par27">The discoveries described above imply the selective absorption of plant miRNAs by animals, i.e. only plant miRNAs with specific sequence could be absorbed by specific species of animals, which also provides an explanation for studies that reported the un-detectability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] of several plant miRNAs in animals. In this paper, we first systematically studied the sequence differences between the plant miRNAs which can transfer (xenomiR group) and cannot transfer (non-xenomiR group) into human bodies using statistics methods. Significant difference was found in 28 sequence features between the two groups, which suggested the potential patterns underlying the plant-derived xenomiR sequences and a possible link between these patterns with selective absorption of xenomiRs. Subsequently, a random forest (RF) model and a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) model were trained to distinguish the two groups. Both models successfully distinguished between xenomiRs and non-xenomiRs with high accuracy. They were then used to predict potential plant-derived xenomiRs on unlabeled plant miRNAs, and a total of 241 plant miRNAs were identified as xenomiRs by both models. Finally, we analyzed the functions of the 241 predicted along with 166 previously reported xenomiRs in human body. Taken together, we report the first systematic plant-derived xenomiR sequences analysis, and the results provide evidence for selective absorption of plant miRNAs by human body. In addition, we propose the first list of high-probability xenomiRs, which further enables more robust decisions regarding plant miRNAs candidates for experimental validation and facilitates future investigation about the mechanisms of xenomiRs transferring into animal bodies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Datasets and feature extraction</title><p id="Par28">For sequence comparison, we collected 166 xenomiR sequences (positive samples) and 942 non-xenomiR sequences (negative samples). All 166 xenomiRs (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1) were collected from our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], which were obtained from 388 healthy human samples analyzed by a rigorous bioinformatics pipeline. These miRNAs covered almost all the reported plant-derived xenomiRs so far. Regarding non-xenomiRs (negative samples), no off the shelf dataset is available at present. To obtain the non-xenomiRs as accurately as possible, we carefully selected the miRNAs that have never been detected in human from <italic>osa</italic>, <italic>Zea maize</italic> (zma)<italic>, Glycine max</italic> (gma) and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (ath) (see &#x0201c;Methods&#x0201d;), which are either staple food or the plant closely related to common vegetables (see &#x0201c;Discussion&#x0201d;). In total, 942 miRNAs (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2) were labeled as non-xenomiRs. For both positive and negative samples, we extracted the length, nucleotide positions, 1~&#x02009;3&#x02009;nt motif frequency in full miRNA sequences and 1~&#x02009;2&#x02009;nt motif frequency in miRNA seed regions (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3). All these features are widely used in miRNA associated researches.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Statistical analysis of the differences between xenomiRs and non-xenomiRs</title><p id="Par29">Considering the similarity of the members in the same miRNA family, we first studied the miRNA families to which the xenomiRs belong according to the miRNA families classified by miRBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In total, 49 miRNA families were mapped by xenomiRs (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S4), among which 8 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) covered more than half of the 166 xenomiRs. In mir168 family, up to 41.2% miRNAs (7 out of 17 miRNA sequences) were mapped by xenomiRs. These results suggested that xenomiRs are likely to enrich in specific miRNA families, rather than randomly distributed among all miRNA families. That may be caused by the common sequence features in miRNA families.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The top 8 plant miRNA families that contain the most xenomiRs.

The percentages of the 4 kinds of nucleotides (adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and uracil (U)) in each position were obtained for each group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), respectively. It can be found that the percentages of nucleotides are different in xenomiRs and non-xenomiRs, especially the percentages of pyrimidines (U at the 1st, 7th, 9th, 13th, 15th~17th position, and C at the 3rd, 4th, 5th,6th, 9th, 13th, 15th~22nd position), suggesting the difference in position features between the two groups. Hypothesis tests were also performed on all the other features listed in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3 for further comparison. In total, 23 out of 105 features were significantly different between the two groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected), as listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, including, C content, U content, six different 2-mer motifs, twelve kinds of 3-mer motifs and three kinds of 2-mer motifs in seed region. It can be found that, comparing with non-xenomiRs, the contents of most motifs (1~&#x02009;3 mer) with C nucleotides are higher in xenomiRs, yet the contents of most motifs with U nucleotides are lower. Besides, the sequence length of xenomiRs is also significantly shorter than that of non-xenomiRs. Taken together, our results suggested that xenomiRs and non-xenomiRs are separable in sequence feature space.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Nucleotide position comparison between xenomiRs and non-xenomiRs.

Being conservative, we only considered these 241 miRNAs as predicted xenomiRs. Further, we analyzed the potential functions of all possible xenomiRs in human bodies, including 166 previously reported xenomiRs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1) and 241 predicted xenomiRs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Table S7).

The 2194 unique target genes (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Table S8) identified by both tools were regarded as high-probability targets (see &#x0201c;Methods&#x0201d;).

We have then shown the feasibility of distinguishing between xenomiRs and non-xenomiRs based on miRNA sequences using machine learning models. High accuracies were achieved by both random forest model and 1D-CNN model. This could serve as a valuable tool for predicting potential xenomiRs that have not yet been discovered, based on which further biological experiments could be conducted for validating their ability of transferring into human bodies and more importantly, exploring their potential functions. The important features of xenomiRs identified here might offer insights into underlying mechanisms of xenomiRs transferring into and keeping stable in animal body. In addition, we have provided the first list of high-probability xenomiRs as well as their potential functions. Of interest, the functions of the predicted targets of these xenomiRs seem to be consistent with previous studies (see details below). We have shown in our previous paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] that the plant miRNAs detected in human bodies are tissue-specific and cannot be fully explained by contamination and provided evidence for the xenomiRs hypothesis. The selective absorption of plant miRNAs by animal bodies could provide an explanation for studies where xenomiRs were not detected in animal bodies. If more plant-derived xenomiRs in different human tissues are available, our 1D-CNN model could be adjusted slightly using transfer learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] to learn the different patterns of plant-derived xenomiRs in different tissues. Thus, the channel tropism proposed in Inner Gannon of Huangdi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] may be better explained, and the corresponding tissues, where a specific herb function may also be predicted.</p><p id="Par39">More than one hundred species of xenomiRs have been reported so far, however, more species of xenomiRs remain to be discovered, especially those in the plants seldom consumed, such as traditional medical herbs. The discovery of xenomiRs in traditional medical herbs has great significance in better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic function of these herbs. Therefore, to predict the potential xenomiRs using machine learning model is of great significance. However, since no off the shelf data were available, we collected xenomiRs/non-xenomiRs in the following way.</p><p id="Par40">The positive dataset was extracted through a rigorous pipeline, which includes all plant-derived miRNAs identified from all sRNA-seq data of healthy individuals in NCBI GEO database (before 2016). It accorded well with the xenomiRs reported in human tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Hence, the positive dataset contained currently reported plant-derived xenomiRs in common food. It is likely that some plant-derived xenomiRs were not included in the positive dataset due to their low abundance under normal condition. However, it is still the optimum choice given current scientific advances.</p><p id="Par41">The collection of negative data, on the other hand, is less straightforward. We chose miRNAs from plants that are human everyday diet or closely related to common vegetables, but have never been detected in human samples. There might exist xenomiRs remain undetected, due to either the inability of current detection technique or inappropriate experimental conditions, such as the time after oral administration or amount of food taken in. To maximally avoid false negatives in our negative dataset, we included only &#x0201c;non-xenomiRs&#x0201d; in four species that can be regarded as everyday diet, i.e. ath, gma, osa and zma (ath is closely related to common vegetables, such as <italic>Brassica rapa</italic>, <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic>, <italic>Brassica juncea</italic> and <italic>Oilseed rape</italic>). Therefore, the selection of negative dataset is based on current advances in plant-derived xenomiRs. Of note, we cannot rule out all false negatives, which might limit the accuracy of our models.</p><p id="Par42">However, the identification of these false positives/negatives requires biological verification, which is time consuming due to the enormous number of candidates. Our model, although imperfect, could serve as the first and efficient tool for selecting the most probable ones for further experimental verification. The verified xenomiRs or non-xenomiRs could, in turn, be fed to our model, and thus improve its accuracy.</p><p id="Par43">The 166 xenomiRs in the positive dataset are from 49 miRNA families and 55.3% are from 8 miRNA families (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Table S10). For non-xenomiRs in the negative dataset, 48% are from these 49 miNRA families but only 19.0% are from the top 8 families containing xenomiRs (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Table S10). In the prediction set, 201 (83.4%) additional members of these 49 miRNA families have been predicted as xenomiRs, among which 123 (50.9%) are from the top 8 families (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Table S10). It can be seen that both collected and predicted xenomiRs concentrate in limited and similar group of families.</p><p id="Par44">In feature extraction, each sequence was assumed to have 24&#x02009;nt. The choice of 24&#x02009;nt was not arbitrary. We tried to use the fist 21&#x02009;nt ~&#x02009;23&#x02009;nt as well as the last 21&#x02009;nt ~&#x02009;23&#x02009;nt of each miRNA sequence as the sequence position features, for better capturing 5&#x02032; end and 3&#x02032; end absolute sequence position features, respectively. The final choice was made upon the model performance, i.e. training our models using 24&#x02009;nt could slightly outperform the other cases. Furthermore, only 0.047% plant miRNAs for prediction are longer than 24&#x02009;nt. Thus, truncating the part of miRNAs longer than 24&#x02009;nt had minor effect on the performance of our models. We chose sequence-based features because they are very commonly used to characterize miRNAs and play essential roles in the function of miRNAs. They might also affect miRNAs&#x02019; ability of entering human body. This motivated us to investigate the difference in sequence-based features between xenomiRs and non-xenomiRs. Our results, indeed, confirmed that existence of significant difference between these two groups of miRNAs (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par45">The structure-based features of miRNAs were also tried to use in training our models. However, because a miRNA is very short, most of them cannot construct a stable secondary structure, which was verified by predicting miRNA secondary structures using both RNAfold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and our previously published tool Fledfold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Nevertheless, adding secondary features of pre-miRNA, including stem features, hairpin loop features, bulge loop features, internal loop features and energy (stability), did not improve model performance. There are two possibilities resulting in this. First, the ability of miRNA entering human body has little to do with the secondary structure of a pre-miRNA. Alternatively, the sample size might limit the usefulness of additional features given to the model.</p><p id="Par46">In our study, the positive dataset was composed of miRNAs from more than 20 species, among which 57% were from ath, gma, osa or zma. All the negative miRNAs were from these four species. Therefore, it is very unlikely that the models simply perform species recognition. If the dataset were separated by species (ath, gma, osa and zma), the positive dataset will be very small (average 24 miRNAs for each specie), leading to a high risk of overfitting. A model such like that has poor generalization ability. Re-training our models using miRNA data from single species (ath, gma, osa or zma) verified this thought: the re-rained model performs much better on training set, compared to testing set (accuracy: 81% VS 62%).</p><p id="Par47">High GC content was reported to be responsible for the absorption of MIR2911 by animal bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. More generally, the high GC content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and the short length could increase the stability of an RNA. Our results confirmed this by systematic statistical analysis, revealed that xenomiRs have higher GC content (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) and shorter length (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), compared to non-xenomiRs. Meanwhile, other differences between xenomiRs and non-xenomiRs sequences were also identified (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Besides, the important features obtained from our RF model (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S5) provided more insights into the patterns of xenomiR sequence. And if some important patterns are sabotaged, the absorption might be abolished, as in the case where miR2911 sequence is disrupted by just two GC nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In addition, the 3 mer motif &#x02018;CAG&#x02019; was evaluated as one of the most important patterns for distinguishing xenomiRs with non-xenomiRs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S5), suggesting its possible relation with the transference or stability of xenomiRs.</p><p id="Par48">These results supported our assumption that plant-derived miRNAs are absorbed selectively by human and other animals, and only the sequence of a miRNA with certain patterns could be transferred into human bodies. However, further studies are needed to identify more concrete patterns in xenomiR sequences.</p><p id="Par49">Deep Learning has been widely applied in bioinformatics and obtained satisfactory performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Our study used a 1D-CNN model to identify xenomiRs using only raw miRNA sequences as inputs, and higher prediction accuracy was achieved on independent test set, compared to RF model, which used 105 hand-craft features as inputs. It is likely that 1D-CNN model, which is capable of extracting the features of successive nucleotides, could capture the specific patterns underlying xenomiR sequences that contain important information for identifying xenomiRs.</p><p id="Par50">To uncover the potential role of xenomiRs in human body, we analyzed the function of predicted targets of xenomiRs using enrichment analysis tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Many identified functions have already been reported by other studies with bio-experiments. For example, xenomiRs were reported to be related with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], inflammatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], circulation system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] in human body. And recent studies reported an association between xenomiRs with neuron development of pandas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and the caste development of honeybees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">This study does not deny the animal-derived xenomiRs hypothesis. However, animal-derived xenomiRs are much more difficult to identify because of the high sequence conservation, which obscures the differences between dietary animal miRNAs and endogenous miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Hence, in this study, we only studied the plant-derived xenomiRs.</p><p id="Par52">In addition, many other factors could affect the detectability of xenomiRs in human samples, such as, the miRNA abundance in the consumed plant materials, the stability of plant miRNAs, the time after consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and some special molecules in the diet consumed along with plant miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, in xenomiR studies, randomly selecting miRNAs to perform biological verification is risky. The methodology present in this paper could serve as a valuable and efficient tool for selecting candidate plant miRNAs for biological verification.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Data sets</title><p id="Par53">We collected 166 xenomiRs reported in our previous study as positive data set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].

Specifically, to decrease the false negatives in the negative dataset, the miRNAs were carefully selected. Some miRNAs are only expressed at extreme conditions, such as drought. Hence, instead of directly selecting the non-xenomiRs in four species of plants (ath, gma, osa, zma) from miRBase, we collected non-xenomiRs from 12 sRNA sequencing data in NCBI GEO database. For convenience, we used the processed data provided by GEO. Firstly, the miRNA reads were screened out using miRBase, and abundance of reads in the last 30% were removed. They are probable false negatives because their undetectability in human body might be due to the rather low abundance, and removing those miRNAs with low abundance could reduce possible false negatives in the negative dataset. Furthermore, we removed the miRNAs contained in the positive dataset. The remaining miRNAs constituted non-xenomiRs set for each species were obtained. We merged the miRNA sets obtained from different collected samples, resulting in a pooled miRNA set of four species of plants. In total, 942 non-xenomiRs were obtained (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1) from the pooled miRNA set. Each miRNA sequence was unique in either positive or negative dataset.

Besides, a miRNA is labeled with 1 if it is a xenomiR or 0 otherwise.</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>LDA</title><p id="Par55">LDA was performed using 1~&#x02009;3 mer motifs in full miRNA sequence, 1~&#x02009;2 mer motifs in seed region and the length of miRNA. LD1 for each sample was obtained, and its distribution for both xenomiR and non-xenomiR groups were shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. To compare the degree of compactness for LD1 distribution of the two groups, any distance of LD1 (LD1 distance) between two sample within both groups was obtained, and t-test was performed to test the difference between LD1 distances of the two groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Performance measures</title><p id="Par56">Commonly used metrics were used to evaluate the performance of our models, namely accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP) and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), of which the formulas were summarized in Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>: Table S9. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted using SN and SP, and areas under ROC curves (AUC) were also calculated to further compare the performance of our models.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>One dimensional CNN</title><p id="Par57">Keras framework (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://keras.rstudio.com">https://keras.rstudio.com</ext-link>) was employed to build our 1D-CNN model. The one-of-<italic>K</italic> coding of first <italic>L</italic> nucleotides were flattened into a single one-dimensional vector as inputs for our 1D-CNN model. Since the length of most plant miRNA sequences in xenomiRs or non-xenomiRs are more than 18&#x02009;nt, <italic>L</italic> was set to 18. Hence, <italic>L</italic>&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;<italic>K</italic>&#x02009;units were used in the input layer. Our 1D-CNN model consisted of two convolutional layers to extract features from the miRNA sequences. After flatting the feature maps of second convolutional layer, two dense layers were used, which employed dropout technique and L2 regulation to avoid overfitting. All the layers used sigmoid function as activation function except the two-unit output layer, where softmax function was used. Bayesian optimization was employed to optimized channel sizes and kernel sizes in each convolutional layer, number of units in dense layers, dropout rate and lambda in L2 regulation.</p><p id="Par58">To deal with the imbalance between positive and negative samples in the dataset, an oversampling strategy was employed. Given the training samples containing <italic>P</italic> positive samples and <italic>N</italic> negative samples (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x02009;&#x0003c; <italic>N</italic>), oversampling strategy is as follows. The positive samples were extended to the number of <italic>N</italic> by random sampling in <italic>P</italic> samples with replacement, meanwhile, all the positive samples should be sampled at least one time, resulting in the same number of positive and negative samples. Hence, the same number (<italic>N</italic>) of positive and negative samples were obtained in the training process. When performing the cross validation, the oversampling process was conducted inside the validation loop, i.e., oversample the minority class after the validation set has already been removed from the training set. Thus, the samples in the validation set will not be duplicated and further used in the training process. Doing this way, overfitting of the model is avoided.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Targets prediction of plant-derived xenomiRs and enrichment analysis</title><p id="Par59">We assumed that plant-derived xenomiRs can suppress the target genes in a working manner of endogenous miRNAs. Human 3&#x02019; Untranslated Regions (3&#x02019; UTR) sequences were downloaded from UCSC Genome Browser database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Miranda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and RNAhybrid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] were employed to predict the target genes of xenomiRs, both of which are widely used in miRNA target prediction. And the unique target genes predicted by both tools were regarded as potential plant-derived xenomiR targets (S8 Table). Corresponding gene names were collected for further annotation analysis and GO annotation. KEGG pathway were performed for identifying significant enriched (FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) biological processes and pathways using &#x0201c;clusterProfiler&#x0201d; package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par60">Taken together, this study showed the sequence differences between xenomiRs and non-xenomiRs, and provided the first insights into the sequence specificity of xenomiRs. This could facilitate our better understanding of mechanisms underlying the absorption of plant-derived xenomiRs, as well as the biological processes participated. In addition, we showed the feasibility of using machine learning models for predicting potential plant-derived xenomiRs based on miRNA sequences and made the first attempt to build such models. Furthermore, this study showed that, in xenomiR studies, randomly picking plant miRNAs to carry out a bio-experiment could be risky, in terms of being inefficient, and the plant miRNAs should be decided with great care, for example, picking miRNAs in detected xenomiRs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1) or predicted xenomiRs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Table S7) provided in our study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>
