    "BACKGROUND:Heat shock proteins have important functions in regulating plant growth and response to abiotic stress. HSP70 family genes have been described in several plant species, but a comprehensive analysis of the HSP70 family genes in cabbage has not been reported to date, especially their roles in floral development. RESULTS:In this study, we identified 52 BoHSP70 genes in cabbage. The gene structures, motifs, and chromosome locations of the BoHSP70 genes were analyzed. The genes were divided into seven classes using a phylogenetic analysis. An expression analysis showed that the BoHSP70 genes were highly expressed in actively growing tissues, including buds and calluses. In addition, six BoHSP70 genes were highly expressed in the binuclear-pollen-stage buds of a male fertile line compared with its near isogenic sterile line. These results were further verified using qRT-PCR. Subcellular localization analysis of the bud-specific gene BoHSP70-5 showed that it was localized in the cytoplasm. CONCLUSIONS:Our results help to elucidate the involvement of the BoHSP70 family genes in cabbage floral development and establish the groundwork for future research on the functions of these genes."
