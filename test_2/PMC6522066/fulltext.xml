These can be combined with wet lab experiments for a rational search. Improved, point-of-care diagnostic tests for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), early case detection and surveillance are required. Previous investigations demonstrated the potential of IgG1 as a biomarker for monitoring clinical status in rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), although using a crude lysate antigen (CLA) as capturing antigen. Replacing the CLA by specific antigens would lead to more robust RDTs.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methodology</title><p>Immunoblots revealed <italic>L. donovani</italic> protein bands detected by IgG1 from VL patients. Upon confident identification of these antigens by mass spectrometry (MS), we searched for evidence of constitutive protein expression and presence of antigenic domains or high accessibility to B-cells. Selected candidates had their linear epitopes mapped with <italic>in silico</italic> algorithms. Multiple high-scoring predicted epitopes from the shortlisted proteins were screened in peptide arrays. The most promising candidate was tested in RDT prototypes using VL and nonendemic healthy control (NEHC) patient sera.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Over 90% of the proteins identified from the immunoblots did not satisfy the selection criteria and were excluded from the downstream epitope mapping. Screening of predicted epitope peptides from the shortlisted proteins identified the most reactive, for which the sensitivity for IgG1 was 84% (95% CI 60&#x02014;97%) with Sudanese VL sera on RDT prototypes.

Without treatment, VL is fatal. Although diagnostic techniques, mainly based on the detection of anti-<italic>Leishmania</italic> antibodies are available, invasive procedures such as microscopy from spleen or bone marrow aspirates are still required for the diagnosis of seronegative VL suspects, for the detection of recurrent cases and to confirm cure after successful treatment. Previous investigations showed the potential of IgG1 as a biomarker of post-chemotherapeutic relapse for VL in rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) sensitised with crude lysate antigen (CLA). Here we employed <italic>in silico</italic> tools to search for desired protein features in a large number of <italic>L. donovani</italic> antigens detected by human IgG1 in western blots. We then employed prediction algorithms to profile epitopes from the shortlisted proteins. We screened a panel of high-scoring peptides in a high-throughput manner using arrays, with low reagent consumption. The most reactive peptide was adapted to RDTs, showing promising results of both sensitivity and specificity. This peptide has the potential of replacing the CLAs in IgG1 RDTs. Thus we believe that <italic>in silico</italic> tools can be used to optimise wet lab experiments for a rational search of biomarkers.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>H2020 Marie Sk&#x00142;odowska-Curie Actions ()</institution></funding-source><award-id>642609</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7127-0137</contrib-id><name><surname>Bremer Hinckel</surname><given-names>Bruno Cesar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000862</institution-id><institution>Sir Halley Stewart Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marlais</surname><given-names>Tegwen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>BCBH was part of the Euroleish.net training network (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.euroleish.net/">http://www.euroleish.net/</ext-link>) and has received funding from the European Commission Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Marie-Sklodowska Curie grant agreement number 642609.

The visceral form&#x02014;visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as kala-azar (Hindi for &#x02018;black fever&#x02019;) affects internal organs such as liver, spleen and bone marrow, and leads to death if left untreated. VL is caused by parasites of the <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> complex and in 2015 over 23.000 new cases were reported to the world health organization (WHO) worldwide [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] while an overall case-fatality rate of 10% has been estimated [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. VL is diagnosed by a combination of clinical symptoms, including prolonged fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly and malaise, and the detection of parasite-specific immunoglobulins (Igs). The recombinant protein rK39, a fragment of a <italic>Leishmania infantum</italic> kinesin-like gene, was described in 1993 [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and remains the most widely used antigen for VL serodiagnosis.

Although a slight better performance compared to the rK39, both in terms of sensitivity and specificity, was reported with Sudanese VL patients [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], important variations in sensitivity amongst different rK39 rapid diagnostic test (RDT) manufacturers were also reported from that region [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Moreover, false positive rates as high as 19.5% in eastern African patients were described [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], meaning that further investigations are still required to confirm the relevance of the rK28 as well as its superiority over the rK39-based diagnostic tests for VL in eastern African patients.

The first <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp. genome sequencing was completed in 2005 [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

Moreover, the availability of next-generation sequencing made it possible to perform whole transcriptome sequencing. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) generates data on the transcriptome at a specific stage of a pathogen life cycle or in a specific culture condition of an organism. The growing number of available, high quality, whole genome sequences has become a central element in the area of comparative genomics, which has contributed greatly to a better understanding of multiple aspects of the leishmaniases, including determinants of disease phenotype [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], mode of action of drugs [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and parasite biology [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Igs are a major component of the immune system. They bind specific regions of pathogens&#x02019; proteins (epitopes), tagging them for clearance by the immune system. Epitopes can be divided into linear (a continuous stretch of amino acids (AAs)) and discontinuous (where non-proximal residues are brought together by protein folding) and can be identified by functional and structural studies (e.g. X-ray crystallography), while <italic>in silico</italic> epitope prediction algorithms are gaining popularity. The early prediction methods of linear B-cell epitopes were mainly based on propensity scales [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

Synthetic peptides can then be incorporated into arrays, enabling the screening of a large number of candidates in pilot serological assays. Promising candidates can be adapted and tested in RDTs, a format suitable for field use.</p><p>Here we employed comparative genomics as well as <italic>in silico</italic> algorithms to reduce drastically the excessive number of <italic>L. donovani</italic> protein candidates recognised by human IgG1, which has been shown to be a potential indicator of post-chemotherapeutic relapse in VL, using RDT prototypes sensitised with a <italic>L. donovani</italic> crude lysate antigen (CLA) [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. By screening a large number of predicted epitopes from selected candidate antigens containing desired protein features, we identified one peptide specifically recognised by IgG1 in arrays. This peptide was also tested in prototype RDTs with VL patient sera as well as sera from nonendemic healthy controls (NEHCs), showing promising results of both sensitivity and specificity on a small sample size. Thus we propose that this approach is a valid proof of concept for the discovery of diagnostic peptides, which can be used to replace the CLA in IgG1 RDTs, leading to the production of cheaper and more robust RDTs for monitoring clinical status in VL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>In India, the collection of samples was approved by the Ethics Committee of Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi while in Sudan the approval for collection and research was granted by the Ethical Research Committee, Faculty of Medicine, University of Khartoum and the National Health Research Ethics Committee, Federal Ministry of Health, Sudan.

The majority of relapses occur between 6 and 12 months after therapy completion [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], while rates are drug dependant and can reach levels up to 20% at 12 months after completion of therapy in immunocompetent patients [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The situation is even more dramatic in HIV-coinfected patients, where relapse rates as high as 70% have been reported [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Considering that most of the patients affected by VL live in poor and remote villages in developing countries [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], the development of easy-to-use diagnostic tools is of utmost importance in order to follow up patients up to 12 months upon treatment completion in a primary care setting. Currently there is no point-of-care serodiagnostic tool for detection of relapses in VL. Despite unquestionable value of the rK39-based RDTs for active cases identification, they cannot be used as a tool to detect relapses due to antibody persistence even after complete disease clearance [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>We have identified a peptide detected by human IgG1 from VL patients by mapping epitopes from multiple proteins, which were selected from immunoblots by searching antigenic features using comparative genomics and <italic>in silico</italic> algorithms. The peptide was adapted to RDT prototypes and showed promising results for VL serology in terms of both sensitivity and specificity with limited sample size. Given the free online availability and growing number of various <italic>in silico</italic> algorithms to predict or scan multiple protein features from DNA or AA sequences and the growing number of high quality sequenced genomes, the adopted strategy can also be employed for the search of diagnostic biomarkers or vaccine candidates for other infectious diseases [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>The decision to make use of comparative genomics and <italic>in silico</italic> algorithms to refine the output from immunoblots came from the excessive number of putative hits identified by MS, and we believe that the strength of our approach lies in this combination. Nonetheless, we consider that technical issues might have been related to the excessive number of hits initially identified by MS from the western blots. The immunogenic bands excised from the acrylamide gels that were analysed by MS were excised from gels with wide lanes (59 mm). We believe that excising such wide lanes from acrylamide gels contributed to the excessive number of hits: by mechanically cutting along very wide lanes, we have probably included proteins that would not have been present had we excised narrower (e.g. 4 mm wide) lanes, although multiple hits would have been probably identified anyway.</p><p>We have identified antigens from <italic>L. donovani</italic> promastigotes due to ease of culturing. In the host, promastigotes are phagocytosed by macrophages or other types of mononuclear phagocytic cells, where they differentiate into amastigotes, remaining in this form until transmission to a new vector [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Therefore we believe that amastigote proteins are more likely to be targeted by host Igs. We have chosen a non-stringent HAP cut-off for both promastigotes and amastigotes (HAP&#x0003e;Q1) due to the generally nonstrong correlation between mRNA and protein expression levels observed in eukaryotes [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. By doing so, we avoided missing antigens that might be constitutively expressed, despite low mRNA levels. Given the excessive number of protein candidates identified by MS we could set a stricter MASCOT score cut-off, ruling out proteins that could have been identified by chance in each antigenic band. Extracellular proteins are more accessible for binding with host Igs, thus we have included this criterion in our filter. Finally, because intracellular proteins harbouring TRs are amongst the most widely used antigens for VL diagnosis [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], we decided to select such candidates in parallel to extracellular proteins. Although the vast majority of epitopes founds in proteins are discontinuous [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], the use of such prediction algorithms is only meaningful in case the native 3D structure of the proteins is retained, which is not the case upon completion of an SDS-PAGE gel. In addition, the prediction of discontinuous epitopes relies on the scarce availability of experimentally validated epitopes.</p><p>Even though the <italic>in silico</italic> filter that we applied ruled out over 90% of the proteins initially identified by MS from the immunoblots, it remained impracticable to test the antigenicity of all 65 selected proteins. By screening synthetic peptides instead of recombinant proteins we circumvented the lengthy and costly protein expression and purification steps and could therefore test a large number of top-scoring candidates predicted from multiple algorithms with various prediction methods. Moreover, the production of peptide arrays allowed the screening of multiple peptides at various concentrations using low volumes of reagents of limited availability to us (e.g. VL serum).</p><p>The pilot screening with peptide arrays revealed that the EpQ11 was the most sensitive peptide, despite cross-reacting with NEHC serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007353.g005">Fig 5</xref>). By showing the clear effect of the hybridisation conditions on the specificity of the EpQ11 in arrays, especially that of the spotting concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007353.g006">Fig 6</xref>), we sought to test the EpQ11 in RDTs, taking into account that the format of the test (i.e. peptide array vs. RDTs) could have an even larger impact on the specificity/ sensitivity of the peptide. We believe that the long hybridisation periods employed in our peptide arrays played a crucial role on the higher sensitivities observed when compared to the RDT prototypes. On the other hand, by using a format of lower sensitivity, we managed to avoid the false positive signals generated by the NEHC samples in peptide arrays. The intensity of the test line of our RDT prototypes might be improved by using a larger peptide composed of multiple copies in series (&#x02018;peptide trains&#x02019;) or in parallel (multiple antigen peptides), a strategy already used in vaccine development [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], to boost the recognition of synthetic peptides by Igs, although we are aware that this improvement in sensitivity might have a negative effect on the specificity of the test.</p><p>In spite of these advantages of screening peptide epitopes in a high-throughput manner, the most important antigens for VL diagnosis (e.g. rK39, rK28) are still recombinant proteins. It would have been an interesting alternative to apply the <italic>in silico</italic> filter described here to proteins of lower molecular weight (e.g. those between 25 and 37 kDa&#x02014;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007353.g002">Fig 2</xref>), to test the antigenicity of a few of them. Low molecular weight proteins are generally easier to express and purify when compared to large antigens. We decided, however, to focus our search in predicted epitopes from larger proteins due to (I) the large number of possible epitopes that proteins of high molecular weight have and (II) we were not entirely convinced about the matching between the antigenic bands in the western blots and those in the gels, mainly due to the high density of proteins in that region of the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007353.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p><p>Another limitation of our study lies in the restricted range of serum samples available to us. Our ultimate goal was to use the EpQ11 peptide to detect IgG1 from pre-treatment VL patients paired with post-treatment (deemed cured), such that we could assess its use as a replacement for the <italic>Leishmania</italic> CLA in IgG1 RDTs, as described in [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Replacing the CLA by synthetic peptides would allow the manufacturing of more robust RDTs as a non-invasive tool to help in supporting the confirmation of cure after successful chemotherapy. Advantages of employing synthetic peptides (vs. whole-cell lysates) include unproblematic and low-cost synthesis and the production of more standardised (and potentially more sensitive and specific) diagnostic tests. Due to local regulations, however, it is not possible to export human sera from India, where the cured paired serum samples from our partner institutions are available (western blots were carried out on site in 2015), such that we could only carry out the peptide pilot screening as well as the sensitivity tests in RDTs with Sudanese active VL sera. As, however, Sudanese patients show generally a weaker immune response when compared to Indian VL patients [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], the serum samples that we tested can be considered &#x02018;worst-case scenario&#x02019; samples such that we would expect the sensitivity in India to be at least as high as the values reported in this study (<xref rid="pntd.0007353.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The EpQ11 was also not tested with EHCs. However, EHCs used in both western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007353.g002">Fig 2</xref>) and ELISAs were negative with <italic>L. donovani</italic> CLA [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Finally, even though it is important to test the EpQ11 with serum samples from patients presenting with potentially cross-reacting diseases (e.g. malaria, human African trypanosomiasis), we would not expect a high rate of false positives due to low protein sequence conservation between the LdBPK_360019900.1. and proteins from organisms causing potentially cross-reacting diseases, especially in the region harbouring the EpQ11 sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007353.g008">Fig 8</xref>).</p><fig id="pntd.0007353.g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0007353.g008</object-id><label>Fig 8</label><caption><title>The <italic>L. donovani</italic> protein containing the EpQ11 sequence shows low similarity to proteins from organisms causing potentially cross-reacting diseases.</title><p>The <italic>L. donovani</italic> protein harbouring the EpQ11 peptide (LdBPK_360019900.1&#x02014;v2 ID) was aligned against the proteome of organisms causing potentially cross-reacting diseases with VL using MAFFT v7.222 [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].

Meanwhile, given the evidence from the present work that the described peptide specifically binds to IgG1 from Sudanese VL patient sera, the sequence of the EpQ11 could be synthetically coupled to that of the rK39, potentially improving the sensitivity of the latter antigen, including in IgG1 RDTs, whose potential in monitoring clinical status in VL has recently been shown [<xref rid="pntd.0007353.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p><sec id="sec034"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on the interpretation of the results of our experiments we conclude that:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Comparative genomics as well as <italic>in silico</italic> algorithms are useful tools for refining large output from wet lab experiments for a rational search for diagnostic peptides.</p></list-item><list-item><p>B-cell epitopes prediction algorithms represent an interesting option for epitope mapping, enabling the screening of peptides in a high-throughput manner with minimal reagent consumption.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We have identified a peptide that specifically binds to human IgG1 from Sudanese VL patients by refining wet lab experiments with <italic>in silico</italic> searches.
