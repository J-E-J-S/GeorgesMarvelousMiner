Prenylated phenylpropanes, such as artepillin C (3,5-diprenyl-<italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid), exhibit a broad range of pharmaceutical effects.

These hybrid-type metabolites have been identified as the bioactive components in many medicinal plants; to date, about 1000 of these compounds have been chemically and biologically characterized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The physiological and pharmacological effects of these compounds differ widely, with many having antioxidant, antibacterial, antitumor, and estrogenic activities, with some having anti-obesity and anti-muscle atrophy properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. These specialized metabolites can be classified according to the structures of their core nuclei. The largest group consists of flavonoids, followed by coumarins, phloroglucinols, xanthones, stilbenes, and simple phenylpropanoids. In particular, the di-prenylated <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, artepillin C has been extensively studied over the last two decades due to its close relationship to propolis, a valuable apicultural product.</p><p id="Par4">Propolis is a resinous substance prepared by honeybees, which collect resins from buds and other aerial parts of different plant species, and used by honeybees to seal physical defects (e.g., cracks and holes) in beehives, to prevent invasion by their predators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This honeybee product has been sold worldwide in natural medicines and food supplements because of its broad pharmaceutical and health-promoting activities, which have been attributed to its complex chemistry involving over 500 constituents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The chemical composition of propolis is highly dependent on its botanical sources, geological locations, and bee species, with each type of propolis having a unique spectrum of bioactivities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Brazilian green propolis is one of the most globally widespread types used for commercial purposes and is characterized by the presence of bioactive prenylated derivatives of <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, such as drupanin and artepillin C, as major constituents, with concentrations frequently exceeding 10%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.

This differentiation is mediated by direct binding of the compound to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) &#x003b3;, a master regulator of adipocyte differentiation, as an agonist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Moreover, the prenyl moieties on the aromatic ring of artepillin C are key to the potency of its bioactivities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Prenylation of aromatic rings in plants is catalyzed by prenyltransferases (PTs) belonging to the membrane-bound UbiA protein superfamily<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.

In contrast, genes encoding PTs acting on simple phenylpropanes have not yet been identified. Furthermore, assessments of multiple prenylated phenolic compounds have not well understood whether different PTs are responsible for individual prenylations, or whether one enzyme catalyzes the multiple prenylation reactions.</p><p id="Par7">Biosynthetic genes to produce <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid have been already revealed in plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, meaning that discovery of a PT gene accepting this phenylpropane molecule would enable synthetic biological production of artepillin C and its related compounds. This production system might improve the current situation of the limited availability of these molecules. Regardless of generally high contents of artepillin C along with its relatives in Brazilian green propolis, their contents strongly affected by various natural factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, being a serious issue of quality control in propolis production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. <italic>B. dracunculifolia</italic> can be considered as an alternative natural source, but the accessibility to this plant is strictly confined due to its major distribution within the southeastern parts of Latin America<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

These unigenes were subjected to a homology-based screening of candidate genes encoding phenylpropanoid-specific PTs. Aromatic substrate PTs involved in plant specialized metabolism share moderate amino acid identities (ca. 30&#x02013;50%) with their probable ancestral UbiA PTs being involved in plant primary metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Hence, we searched for NCBI nucleotide collection for Asteraceae polypeptide sequences in all six UbiA subfamilies involved in plant primary metabolism, i.e., homogentisate phytyltransferase (vitamin E 2-1, VTE2-1) for tocopherol, homogentisate solanesyltransferase (VTE2-2) for plastoquinone, 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid phytyltransferase (aberrant chloroplast development 4, ABC4) for phylloquinone, chlorophyll synthase (ATG4), protoheme IX farnesyltransferase (cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase 10, COX10) for Heam <italic>a</italic>, and <italic>p</italic>-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase (PPT) for ubiquinone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.

This result suggested that these five candidates differ functionally from all of the primary metabolite genes used as queries in <italic>A. capillaris</italic>. A subsequent Reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (RPKM)-based search for the five candidates showed that the expression of unigene 9515 was higher than that of the other genes (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>).

Surprisingly, distribution was only slightly disturbed even by exogeneous <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, which largely affected the yield. The strict localization patterns are seemingly linked to the number of prenyl moieties. Alternatively, prenyl moieties are likely responsible for intracellular localization, which is also observed during yeast production of prenylated phloroglucinols and prenylated flavonoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.

The yeast production system shown here may contribute to the supply of a stable source of artepillin C as an alternative to propolis.
