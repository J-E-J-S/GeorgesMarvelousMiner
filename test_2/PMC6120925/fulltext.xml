However, to date no experimental data exist that explores this concept in a multicellular organism. Here we examine the requirements for building artificial reproductive barriers in the metazoan model <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> by combining CRISPR-based genome editing and transcriptional transactivation (CRISPRa) of the same loci. We directed 13 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to the promoters of 7 evolutionary conserved genes and used 11 drivers to conduct a misactivation screen. We identify dominant-lethal activators of the <italic>eve</italic> locus and find that they disrupt development by strongly activating <italic>eve</italic> outside its native spatio-temporal context. We employ the same set of sgRNAs to isolate, by genome editing, protective INDELs that render these loci resistant to transactivation without interfering with target gene function. When these sets of genetic components are combined we find that complete synthetic lethality, a prerequisite for most applications, is achievable using this approach. However, our results suggest a steep trade-off between the level and scope of dCas9 expression, the degree of genetic isolation achievable and the resulting impact on fly fitness. The genetic engineering strategy we present here allows the creation of single or multiple reproductive barriers and could be applied to other multicellular organisms such as disease vectors or transgenic organisms of economic importance.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The advent of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology has provided the means to modify genomes with unparalleled specificity and accuracy in a wide variety of model and non-model organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. These advances in genome engineering, besides enabling a wave of basic research, have also been applied with the aim of distorting inheritance in insect disease vectors. CRISPR gene drives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and sex-distorters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> are currently being considered for their enormous potential to control harmful organisms such as insect vectors of human malaria. The CRISPR machinery now broadly employed for gene editing in many organisms, has recently been modified to manipulate the transcriptome; namely targeted gene transactivation and repression. CRISPR gene activation (CRISPRa) uses a nuclease-deficient, deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) protein, fused to a transactivation domain which recruits the basal transcriptional machinery to the site of sgRNA complementarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. This expanded CRISPR toolset now allows for the exploration of more radical genetic engineering concepts one of which is the design of artificial reproductive isolation and the generation of synthetic species. While the terms artificial hybrid incompatibilities or artificial reproductive isolation may be more precise (there are many examples of natural hybrid incompatibilities within species), we maintain herein the term synthetic species as it connects to the existing literature and better illustrates the potential use for such a technology. There are multiple potential applications of synthetic species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Briefly, the prevention of undesired flow of genetic information is a major concern for the field of biotechnology. The introgression of transgenes from Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) into the gene-pool of their native counterparts, or the escape of gene drives could be counteracted by this technology. Alternatively, since the synthetic species and its parent species are assumed to be largely identical one can replace the other in a process that is aided by the engineered incompatibility of hybrids. In theory synthetic species released into wild populations would first predominately mate with wild-type individuals, with hybrid incompatibility reducing the number of productive mating events, leading to population suppression of the wild-type. The successive release of additional synthetic species individuals into an increasingly wild-type suppressed population would result in more and more mating between synthetic species individuals, producing viable offspring, eventually leading to population replacement. Synthetic species of insect disease vectors such as <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> could also be further engineered to include a pathogen suppressing transgenic &#x02018;payload&#x02019;, providing a novel genetic approach to reducing the incidence of malaria. The combination of population suppression and replacement has attractive features in that the release strain requires no special rearing conditions or sterilization. Engineered underdominace, a related approach, works by heterozygotes being less healthy than either wild-type or homozygotes of each transgene. Such systems allowing population replacement by driving of an allele with linked lethal and rescuing elements present at high frequency in a population have recently been demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Unlike engineered underdominance the synthetic species approach causes no loss of reproductive output due to the segregation of toxin/antidote traits at every generation and can be constructed through non-linked elements, however it also does not allow the introgression of a transgene into an existing population.</p><p id="Par3">At an even larger scope, there are possible applications for synthetic species in ecosystem engineering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, e.g. the ability to close and open the reproductive barriers between closely related mating groups and the ability to introduce newly designed species are powerful concepts for environmental management.</p><p id="Par4">Constructing an artificial reproductive barrier requires first the identification of an upstream enhancer or promoter region that allows for lethal, ectopic transactivation of an endogenous gene when targeted by a synthetic transcription factor. It also requires a second modification, the creation of an analogous refractory enhancer region, designed to prevent synthetic transcription factor binding. In this way synthetic lethality is triggered by the transgene in hybrids that result from a cross between modified individuals and those of the naive genetic background. This approach is in principle generalizable and could work in any tractable sexually reproducing organism, because it circumvents the need to research and employ species-specific modes of incompatibility or interfere with endogenous regulatory pathways in order to engineer isolation. This concept has recently been tested in yeast cells using the <italic>ACT1</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In this study, the dCas9 Synergistic Activation Mediator (SAM) system was used to over-express Actin, which resulted in loss of cellular integrity when dCas9 strains were mated to wild-type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, although cells that escape synthetic lethality were observed. This work also highlights that the majority of experimental work utilizing dCas9 with a view to application remains cell-based<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> with its potential in complex systems largely unexplored.</p><p id="Par5">In the present study we combined CRISPR gene editing and transactivation, to explore the design of engineered reproductive barriers in a multicellular organism and to study their properties. Using <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> as a model, we sought to achieve synthetic lethality in crosses with the wild-type by targeted misexpression of genes known to be essential for fly embryo development (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We reasoned that temporal and spatial perturbations of precisely orchestrated wild-type expression patterns during embryogenesis could result in developmental arrest and lethality. We sought to design sgRNAs targeting genes that function during embryogenesis, and couple these with dCas9 transcriptional activators to trigger embryonic lethality. By coupling these same sgRNA with Cas9 expressed in the germline we sought to isolate protective mutations that suppress activation, and then combine these genetic elements into engineered reproductive barriers.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Design of artificial reproductive barriers. An artificial barrier combines dCas9 fused to an Activation Domain (AD) and an sgRNA targeting the promoter or enhancer region of a developmental gene within a protected genome. Protection is achieved by an INDEL mutation at the sgRNA binding site (red triangle) that prevents specific dCas9 binding but maintains target gene function. When a transgenic is crossed to wild-type flies the transgene cannot be inherited as synthetic lethality is triggered. Lethality is caused in hybrids when the native target gene is misexpressed ectopically by CRIPSR transactivation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2018_31433_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e344"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design of the sgRNA panel and dCas9 activation strategy</title><p id="Par6">We first constructed and tested components for ectopic transactivation of target genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and evaluated the degree of transactivation. We designed a panel of 13 sgRNAs (18&#x02013;20&#x02009;bp) targeted to candidate upstream promoter and enhancer regions of 7 developmental genes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome, namely <italic>dpp</italic>, <italic>engrailed</italic>, <italic>eve</italic>, <italic>hairy</italic>, <italic>hid</italic>, <italic>rad51</italic> and <italic>reaper</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>).

Testing the entire panel of sgRNAs in combination with dCas9-VPR (driven by <italic>GMR-</italic>GAL4), we found a 111 fold increase in <italic>eve</italic> expression, using a sgRNA directed to the <italic>eve</italic> promoter (<italic>eve-</italic>sgRNA). The <italic>eve</italic> gene is a pair rule patterning factor expressed during embryogenesis and in nerve cells in the fly brain, and it is not expressed in wild-type eyes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. By comparison, the sgRNAs for <italic>dpp4</italic>, <italic>dpp5</italic>, <italic>engrailed</italic>, <italic>hairy</italic>, <italic>hid1</italic>, <italic>hid2</italic>, <italic>rad51</italic>, <italic>reaper2</italic> increased the expression of their target genes at more moderate levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). The sgRNAs <italic>dpp1</italic>, <italic>dpp2</italic>, <italic>dpp3</italic> and <italic>reaper1</italic> were found to suppress gene expression compared to controls, possibly due to binding competition and steric-hindrance with <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory factors at the site of transcription (<italic>dpp</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and <italic>reaper</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> are both known to play a developmental role in wild-type eyes). We next tested activation strength of dCas9 Histone Acetyltransferase domain fusions in complex with the panel of sgRNAs by qRT-PCR (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>, Supplementary Technical Cross 1B and 1&#x02009;C). While dCas9-P300 Core yielded no detectable increase in transcripts in the eye, dCas9-Nejire Core triggered activation with all sgRNAs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>), to a stronger degree than dCas9-VPR and also with sgRNAs that did not activate in combination with dCas9-VPR. <italic>eve-</italic>sgRNA gave a 863 fold increase with Nejire Core, a significantly stronger induction than the already pronounced effect of dCas9-VPR. Subtle increases in the expression of developmental genes induced through dCas9-VPR are known to have pronounced developmental phenotypes when expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The <italic>eve</italic>-sgRNA in complex with dCas9-VPR did induce a moderately aberrant eye phenotype (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>), however no pronounced aberrant eye phenotype was observed with dCas9-VPR and the sgRNAs targeting the other genes (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1D</xref>). As expected, the combination of dCas9-Nejire Core with the <italic>eve</italic>-sgRNA resulted in a severe eye-developmental mutant phenotype (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). The remaining sgRNAs in combination with dCas9-Nejire Core expressed in eyes all showed abnormal developmental phenotypes (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1C</xref>), as expected dCas9-P300 Core gave no aberrant eye phenotypes (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1E</xref>). These results indicate that dCas9-Nejire Core is a powerful tool to over-express genes in flies using sgRNAs. Even those sgRNAs which did not increase gene expression in conjunction with VPR showed developmental phenotypes consistent with over-expression by Nejire Core. For example three sgRNAs were targeted downstream of the TSS in the <italic>dpp</italic> intron; <italic>dpp3-</italic>sgRNA and <italic>dpp4-</italic>sgRNA target 5&#x02032; of the Dorsal-bound Ventral Repressive Element (VRE) &#x02018;S3&#x02019;, <italic>dpp5-</italic>sgRNA binds 5&#x02032; of VRE &#x02018;S4&#x02019;. Dorsal binds to VREs in the ventral side of the developing embryo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and recruits co-factor Groucho<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> to repress <italic>dpp</italic> at the promoter. Nejire Core induces developmental phenotypes when targeted to <italic>dpp2</italic>, <italic>3</italic>, <italic>4</italic>-sgRNA binding sites. This is consistent with studies with P300 Core in HEK cells which show that P300 Core is capable of activating transcription from distal enhancers whereas as VP64 cannot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, because dCas9-Nejire Core exhibited a subtle but reproducible eye phenotype even in the absence of sgRNAs we decided, in the context of this study, to focus on dCas9-VPR for the remaining experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Misexpression screen during early fly development using dCas9</title><p id="Par8">We next tested our sgRNAs against a panel of GAL4 drivers expressing dCas9-VPR, in a screen for developmental arrest/lethality during early stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic> development (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). The sgRNAs assayed for activation potential were crossed to a panel of GAL4 driver lines that exhibit diverse temporal/spatial, embryonic, larval or ubiquitous expression patterns. GAL4 lines were maintained over dominant balancers, the inheritance of which was scored in the F1. This allowed for the identification of GAL4-sgRNA combinations&#x02014;in the presence of UAS::dCas9-VPR&#x02014;giving full or partial lethality during embryogenesis and/or larval development (Supplementary Technical Cross&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2A&#x02013;E</xref>, Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).

Temperature-dependent increases in lethality were seen with <italic>dpp1 and rad51</italic> from 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C to 29&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and <italic>dpp2</italic>, <italic>3</italic>, <italic>4</italic>, <italic>5</italic> between room-temperature and 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (and 29&#x02009;&#x000b0;C). As it is known that GAL4 activity increases with temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, we also performed control crosses to lines lacking sgRNAs and showed that elevated temperatures alone do not increase background lethality (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). This suggests that the activation potential of certain sgRNAs may be limited by the level of dCas9-VPR, even when dCas9-VPR is ubiquitously expressed. It is likely that increased genome binding events would lead to increased lethality, rather than increased activity of the VPR domain. This is suggested by the observation that <italic>dpp1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, <italic>3</italic> and <italic>reaper1</italic> show temperature dependent increases in lethality (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>) yet were found to reduce target gene expression in the eye (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>).

However in the pre-CRISPR era, it required the exploitation of complex fly genetics and knowledge of unique biological aspects of the <italic>Drosophila glass</italic> gene. This strategy therefore could not easily be applied to other species or even other loci. One of the principle attractions of the approach we present here, is that it achieves synthetic lethality through minimal modifications of evolutionary conserved loci using the expanded CRIPSR toolset that is now available in a range of organisms. This strategy should facilitate the transfer of this technology to diverse organisms and the rational design of genetic isolation. Recently, a similar strategy was tested in a proof-of-principle in the lower unicellular eukaryote <italic>S</italic>.<italic>cerevisiae;</italic> yeast however requires comparatively fewer and less complex genetic engineering steps than higher eukaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16">Our survey of protective mutations and lethal CRISPRa elements suggests that protecting genomes from transactivation can be achieved at most loci, as INDELS rarely seem to affect nearby <italic>cis</italic>-elements in the promoter or enhancer regions. Isolating a range of INDELS at a target site is straightforward and allows the selection of those that have no negative effects. Achieving synthetic lethality through transactivation by CRISPRa was more challenging, and whilst all sgRNAs used for gene editing yielded INDEL mutations, not all drive strong gene activation with dCas9-VPR. In this study we directed single sgRNAs to enhancer regions and found in most cases a less than 2-fold increase in mRNA levels with one notable expression being the <italic>eve-</italic>sgRNA which to our knowledge leads to the highest increase in gene activation for a single sgRNA tested <italic>in vivo</italic>. This highlights that whilst there are some parameters for the design of effective sgRNAs for DNA cleavage, knowledge of what makes a sgRNA particularly effective at transactivation with widely used activators such as dCas9-VPR, is still lacking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. It has been reported that targeting sgRNAs within 400&#x02009;bp upstream of the transcriptional start site is effective in some contexts, but clearly such positioning alone is insufficient to guarantee strong activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. It has been shown that when multiple sgRNAs are targeted to a promoter the probability of achieving biologically relevant transactivation is increased<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, it has also been shown that when multiple sgRNAs are targeted to a promoter, the effect on transactivation is not synergistic, and can be mostly attributed to a single highly active sgRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. On the other hand it has also been demonstrated that a significant number of sgRNA pairs that target within this window generate observable phenotypes with dCas9-VPR despite relatively modest increases in gene product in some cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, we observed lethality with most sgRNAs when dCas9-VPR is expressed by a ubiquitous GAL4 driver. It is likely, that assaying mRNA expression levels on a tissue aggregate level may overlook more pronounced transactivation in particularly receptive cell types. For example, it has been reported that chromatin accessibility may prevent the binding of Cas9 and the binding of synthetic transcription factors at transcriptionally inactive loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Therefore targeting genes for transactivation in tissues which show low basal levels of expression may be a more effective approach to obtaining sgRNAs capable of strong activation with VPR. It also suggests a role for directed chromatin modifiers which could yield activation for some loci that are refractory to transactivation by more traditional activation domains such as VPR. We found that all sgRNAs tested with dCas9-Nejire Core led to over-expression of targets and morphological phenotypes when the transactivators were expressed in the eye, which was not the case with dCas9-VPR. As expression of dCas9-Nejire Core had subtle developmental phenotypes in the absence of sgRNAs it likely triggered non-specific effects that are too strong to allow it to be used in the context of generating reproductive barriers at present. However, for other applications, and possibly with further modifications to modulate its strength, it could become a powerful building block for the <italic>in vivo</italic> CRISPRa toolbox.</p><p id="Par17">We tested the synthetic lethality of single-vector CRISPRa constructs established in a genetic background homozygous for protective mutations. To obtain lines harboring elements which could not be inherited in crosses to wild-type required a ubiquitous expression pattern of dCas9-VPR using <italic>p&#x003b1;-tubulin</italic>. However, ubiquitous expression by <italic>p&#x003b1;-tubulin</italic> when associated with strong synthetic lethality also precluded the generation of viable homozygotes and thus full genetic isolation of the strain. We achieved a medium level of synthetic lethality in combination with homozygous viability with <italic>ptwist</italic> driven dCas9-VPR. In our misexpression screen <italic>ptwist</italic> had previously triggered complete lethality with <italic>eve-</italic>sgRNA, and it is likely that the lack of the GAL4 amplification loop accounts for this difference. As expected, we also detected varying levels of synthetic lethality with identical constructs depending on the insertion site, suggesting that the genetic context may modulate CRISPRa penetrance.</p><p id="Par18">Whilst we didn&#x02019;t explore the use of multiple stacked genetic barriers in great detail beyond demonstrating a proof-of-principle, their use will likely be a necessity for any realistic application of engineered reproductive isolation. Genetic diversity in large wild-type populations means that circulating rare variants at the sgRNA target sites could abrogate synthetic lethality and lead to the generation of escapers and the eventual breakdown of genetic isolation. By combining two sgRNA activators with their corresponding protective mutations, genetic isolation could be fortified to safeguard against failure through rare recombination, random mutations within the constructs or transgene silencing events. As a proof of principle we demonstrate that using <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>hid1</italic>-sgRNAs allows for stacking of single transactivation elements to induce synergistic effects on synthetic lethality.</p><p id="Par19">We suggest that fine tuning the approach presented here will likely require the refinement of the expression and strength of transactivators, to increase lethality and at the same time reduce fitness costs associated with unacceptably broad expression of CRISPRa transgenic elements. The testing of early tissue-specific promoters with GAL4-UAS amplification to drive transactivator expression from a range of known AttP integration sites with varying expressivity capacity presents itself as a logical next step to fine tune the system. Real-world robustness of genetic barriers could then be achieved by combining two separately tuned barriers. Application of the system in non-model organisms with fewer transgenic tools than that of <italic>Drosophila</italic> may complicate a fine-tuning approach. An approach to mitigate limitations in such organisms may be to attempt multiple combinatorial stacking of less finely tuned barriers targeting diverse loci.</p><p id="Par20">In summary we have generated protective genomes and benchmarked sgRNA targets and activator domains for use in the construction of synthetic species-barriers.

F1 adult females were crossed to appropriate balancer lines to maintain putative INDELs. F2 males were back-crossed as individuals to the balancer line, after successful mating determined by egg-laying the founder F2 parent fly was macerated and DNA extracted by Phenol-Chloroform purification. PCR amplification of the genomic region of interest (~1&#x02009;kb region around sgRNA site) was performed using loci-specific primers (See Supplementary Primers). PCR amplicons were incubated with T7 endonuclease I (NEB) to identify heteroduplex PCR products indicative of INDEL containing amplicons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. PCR amplicons from T7 positive samples were sequenced and heterogeneous sample reads confirmed from the point of DNA mismatch (and INDEL induction). Mutations induced on the 3<sup>rd</sup> Chromosome required additional screening in order to remove the <italic>pvasa::Cas9</italic> construct which is marked by PAX::GFP. This required recombination in the female germ-line (See Supplementary Technical Cross&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4B</xref>). Where possible, flies homozygous for INDELs were selected in the F3 generation and the nature of the lesion confirmed by additional sequencing. The viability of INDEL lines was confirmed through the scoring of dominant balancer markers in the F3 generation. In an inter-sibling cross between two heterozygous balanced individuals, each chromosome (INDEL and balancer) would have an inheritance ratio of roughly 1:2 (Homozygous&#x00394;: Balancer) if no fitness cost were associated with the INDEL. If complete non-absence of balancer was observed then homozygous lethality was assumed. Progeny were counted from individual crosses between two balanced individuals and the Chi-squared test used to ascertain if the incidence of non-balanced F1 individuals were significantly less than the expected ratio of 1:2 (See Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).
