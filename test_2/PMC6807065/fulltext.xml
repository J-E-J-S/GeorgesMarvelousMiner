Efficient biological production often requires extensive genetic manipulation of a microbial host strain, making well-characterised and genetically-tractable model organisms like the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> attractive targets for the engineering of methylotrophic metabolism. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains S288C and CEN.PK are the two best-characterised and most widely used hosts for yeast synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, yet they have unpredictable metabolic phenotypes related to their many genomic differences. We therefore sought to benchmark these two strains as potential hosts for engineered methylotrophic metabolism by comparing their growth and transcriptomic responses to methanol. CEN.PK had improved growth in the presence of methanol relative to the S288C derivative BY4741. The CEN.PK transcriptome also had a specific and relevant response to methanol that was either absent or less pronounced in the BY4741 strain. This response included up-regulation of genes associated with mitochondrial and peroxisomal metabolism, alcohol and formate dehydrogenation, glutathione metabolism, and the global transcriptional regulator of metabolism <italic>MIG3</italic>. Over-expression of <italic>MIG3</italic> enabled improved growth in the presence of methanol, suggesting that <italic>MIG3</italic> is a mediator of the superior CEN.PK strain growth. CEN.PK was therefore identified as a superior strain for the future development of synthetic methylotrophy in <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Yeast</kwd><kwd>Methylotrophy</kwd><kwd>Synthetic biology</kwd><kwd>Metabolic engineering</kwd><kwd>MIG3</kwd><kwd>Methanol</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">The yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, is one of the most intensely studied model eukaryotic microorganisms. This single-celled fungus has a well-characterised genetic system amenable to a large variety of advanced genetic manipulation tools, and robust industrial growth. Thanks to its long history in the food, beverage and bioethanol industries, its safety record, and ability to grow robustly at an industrial scale, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has been widely engineered and deployed as a &#x0201c;cell factory&#x0201d; for the production of chemicals, fuels, foods, materials, and pharmaceuticals [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. With the eventual decline of global oil reserves and mounting environmental concerns over fossil-resource use, renewable methods of biological chemical production are becoming increasingly important. One limitation to the use of cell factories, such as yeast, to achieve this is the fact that they rely on sugars as a carbon source for growth and production. The sugarcane and maize that is commonly used as a bioprocess feedstock relies on arable land, water, and fertiliser that competes with the human food supply. Moreover, the complete transfer of petrochemical production processes to sugar-fed biological production would have a significant impact on food supplies.</p><p id="p0015">An emerging alternative to sugar as a bioprocess feedstock is to use substrates such as carbon dioxide, methane, and methanol as carbon sources for microbial production processes. Compared to the gases carbon dioxide and methane, methanol is a relatively safe and stable liquid at room temperature and therefore does not require alternative infrastructure for transportation, storage and fermentation. Methanol can be derived from the gasification of biomass to synthesis gas with subsequent reduction to methane, followed by oxidation to methanol. This can be achieved chemically or biologically via a variety of emerging technologies [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These processes would enable the use of biomass, municipal waste, or natural gas as feedstocks for bio-production via methanol, enabling independence from arable land and sugar production. For these reasons, methanol has become an attractive carbon source for the metabolic engineering of sustainable chemical production [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">There are many microorganisms that naturally grow using methanol, yet they usually do not have the depth of characterisation and genetic tools of model organisms such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Native methylotrophic metabolism is also optimised for growth, making metabolite production from methanol a challenge. Synthetic methylotrophy in model organisms has therefore become a focus in the fields of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering with recent demonstrations in <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>]. Engineering methylotrophy in yeast is also an attractive option since it would enable production of compounds that require the functional expression of eukaryotic proteins, and could be coupled to a multitude of optimised metabolite production pathways [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p id="p0025">Laboratory strains of <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> such as the S288C derivatives and semi-industrial CEN.PK series, are commonly used for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering projects due to their depth of characterisation and genetic tools. However, significant variation exists in their physiology and genetics with roughly 22,000 point mutations and 83 genes absent in the CEN.PK strains relative to S288C [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. There is an enrichment of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes and regulatory regions that encode enzymes involved in metabolism, and these two popular laboratory strains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> have inherently different capacities for different engineered functions. For example, S288C was shown to produce 10-fold more vanillin from an engineered pathway than a CEN.PK strain in continuous culture [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In contrast, a CEN.PK strain engineered for <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid production made between 20 and 50% more than its S288C counterpart [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Given these fundamental and unpredictable metabolic differences in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain backgrounds, we sought to benchmark and compare the S288C derivative BY4741 and the CEN.PK derivative CEN.PK113-5D strains for their potential as hosts for synthetic methylotrophy, and understand any differences using RNA-seq mediated transcriptomics.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Growth media</title><p id="p0030"><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains were grown in synthetic dropout (SD) media containing Yeast Nitrogen Base Without Amino Acids mix (Sigma-Aldrich Y0626) supplemented with carbon source and/or 0.1% Yeast Extract (Merck 103753) as indicated.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Growth conditions</title><p id="p0035">For spot assays, swabs from streaked agar plates were pre-cultured twice in 10&#x0202f;mL of 1x YNB, 1% glucose in sterile 50&#x0202f;mL Falcon tubes.

These strain and methanol-specific growth differences were consistent with the results obtained from the spot assays, which demonstrated that CEN.PK113-5D has a greater capacity for growth in the presence of methanol than BY4741 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).

Given that there were only marginal (statistically insignificant) differences between the two strains in YEM medium after 24 or 36&#x0202f;h (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D), the transcriptomics analyses were subsequently focused on comparing differences between YEM and YE media for each strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A).<fig id="fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p><bold>Growth of BY4741 and CEN.PK113-5D in liquid yeast extract containing medium with or without 2% methanol.</bold> Growth of prototrophic BY4741 and CEN.PK113-5D strains was tracked for 48&#x0202f;h in 0.1% yeast extract, 1x Yeast Nitrogen Base medium with (YEM) or without 2% methanol (YE).

We found that the CEN.PK strain grows better in the presence of methanol than the BY4741 strain on both solid and liquid medium, but that yeast extract is required to support growth in liquid medium. These differences are important for determining which strain could best serve as a host for the engineering of methylotrophic metabolism. Synthetic methylotrophy has become an active area of research in the field of synthetic biology due to the potential attractiveness and sustainability of methanol as a bioprocess feedstock, and the genetic plasticity of model organisms, such as <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>. We therefore used transcriptomics to gain insight into differences in genes expression that might explain the methanol-specific growth differences between these two laboratory yeast strains.</p><p id="p0110">In contrast to a previous transcriptome study on methanol toxicity in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> S288C where growth medium with yeast extract, peptone, dextrose, and 5% methanol was used [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], we used a lower concentration of methanol (2%), included the semi-industrial CEN.PK113-5D strain, and focused on both strain- and medium-specific differences in transcription. Despite these differences, we found some similar trends to this previous study. For example, we also observed up-regulated aryl alcohol dehydrogenases, alcohol dehydrogenases, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and enzymes involved in glutathione metabolism. These genes are likely involved in the detoxification of methanol and formaldehyde and their up-regulation suggests that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has a native metabolic response to methanol, potentially via promiscuous alcohol dehydrogenase activity followed by formaldehyde detoxification (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). For example, a study by Grey et al. (1996) found that over-expression of <italic>ADH1</italic> lead to hyper-resistance to formaldehyde via possible reduction to methanol, this reaction could also be occurring in the reverse direction oxidising methanol to formaldehyde [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We also found that the CEN.PK strain has a specific response to methanol that differs to that of BY4741, and has some similarities to methylotrophic yeasts such as <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A). This response included up-regulation of genes that are specific to the ethanol responsive <italic>ADR1</italic> transcription factor [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], such as peroxisome biogenesis genes, alcohol dehydrogenase (<italic>ADH2</italic>), and glutathione enzymes. The CEN.PK strain also had significant up-regulation of genes involved in mitochondrial respiration, suggesting a more active metabolism involved in ATP synthesis. In theory, NADH would be derived from formaldehyde and formate detoxification by the CO<sub>2</sub> forming formate dehydrogenase (<italic>FDH1</italic>), which was the most highly up-regulated gene in both strains. The NADH generated from Fdh1p-mediated formate oxidation could then be oxidised via the mitochondrial electron transport chain, as long as the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) was active. Despite <italic>FDH1</italic> being up-regulated in both strains under methanol exposure, <italic>FDH1</italic> was still significantly up-regulated by 9.6-fold in CEN.PK grown on YEM relative to BY4741 grown on YEM.</p><p id="p0115">Another interesting finding was the CEN.PK-specific up-regulation of the <italic>MIG3</italic> transcription factor. <italic>MIG1</italic> and <italic>MIG2</italic> are well-characterised glucose-responsive regulators of metabolism [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>], yet the role of <italic>MIG3</italic> is less well-characterised. Recent work has suggested that <italic>MIG3</italic> is involved in responding to ethanol, and is non-functional in S288C strains [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Given the observed up-regulation of <italic>MIG3</italic> in methanol-treated CEN.PK cultures, which was absent in the equivalent BY4741 cultures, and the fact that we were able to improve the growth of both strains by increasing the expression of <italic>MIG3</italic>, it is possible that this transcription factor mediates the observed CEN.PK-specific transcriptional differences in the presence of methanol. <italic>MIG3</italic> represses <italic>SIR2</italic> expression [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and decreased <italic>SIR2</italic> expression has been shown to improve growth on non-fermentable carbon sources such as ethanol [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It is therefore possible that <italic>MIG3</italic> improves growth on non-fermentable carbon sources in general, rather than methanol specifically, which is supported by our observation that the <italic>MIG3</italic> over-expressing CEN.PK strain also has improved growth on YNB-only medium, without methanol present (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). However, this does not rule out the possibility that <italic>MIG3</italic> mediates the differences in growth and global transcription patterns that we observed between methanol-treated BY4741 and CEN.PK (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). This is supported by the fact that <italic>MIG3</italic> expression in BY4741 enabled an increase in growth under methanol exposure on solid minimal media (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p id="p0120">Both synthetic and native methylotrophy are becoming attractive targets for metabolic engineering due to the potential of methanol as an industrial bioprocess feedstock. Our results, alongside some recent studies, suggest that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is a promising host for the engineering of either native or synthetic methylotrophy. For example, a synthetic methylotrophic pathway involving four genes from <italic>P. pastoris</italic>, including an alcohol oxidase and dihydroxyacetone synthase, was recently expressed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> with a subsequent increase in growth in the presence of methanol [<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, this study did not demonstrate methanol assimilation using <sup>13</sup>C-methanol labelling. The potential for formate assimilation to glycine by redirecting fluxes in the native glycine cleavage complex in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was also recently demonstrated [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and it is not inconceivable that this pathway contributes to the small boost in growth that we observed in the CEN.PK strain grown in liquid culture supplemented with methanol. Alternatively, the NADH generated from the detoxification of methanol and formaldehyde to CO<sub>2</sub> by the Fdh1p enzyme could also boost growth via subsequent ATP generation. Previous work has shown that over-expression of the native formaldehyde dehydrogenase (<italic>SFA1</italic>) can enable the use of formaldehyde as an auxiliary substrate in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], demonstrating the potential for C1 metabolism in yeast.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0125">Due to inherent and unpredictable differences in the S288C and CEN.PK laboratory yeast strains and the need to identify a host strain for the development of synthetic methylotrophy, we compared the methanol-specific growth and transcriptomic responses of the commonly used yeast strains BY4741 and CEN.PK113-5D. We found that the CEN.PK strain had dramatically improved growth on solid media supplemented with methanol relative to the S288C strain (BY4741), and slightly improved growth in liquid yeast extract medium containing methanol compared to yeast extract only medium. In contrast, the S288C derivative had no growth response to methanol in liquid medium. Consistent with this improved methanol-specific growth, the CEN.PK strain had a distinct transcriptomic response to methanol that included up-regulation of mitochondrial genes, peroxisome biogenesis, glutathione metabolism, the alcohol dehydrogenase <italic>ADH2</italic>, the formate dehydrogenase <italic>FDH1</italic>, and the global carbon-source specific transcriptional regulator <italic>MIG3</italic>. Reverse engineering of the CEN.PK phenotype by expressing <italic>MIG3</italic> in the BY4741 strain to improve growth in the presence of methanol also suggested that <italic>MIG3</italic> is a mediator of the improved growth phenotype and distinct transcriptome in CEN.PK.
