The growing problem of drug-resistant pathogenic microorganisms, together with the lack of new effective compounds, has stimulated interest in developing AMPs as anti-infective molecules. PAF102 is an AMP that was rationally designed for improved antifungal properties. This cell penetrating peptide has potent and specific activity against major fungal pathogens. Cecropin A is a natural AMP with strong and fast lytic activity against bacterial and fungal pathogens, including multidrug resistant pathogens. Both peptides, PAF102 and Cecropin A, are alternative antibiotic compounds. However, their exploitation requires fast, cost-efficient production systems. Here, we developed an innovative system to produce AMPs in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> using the oleosin fusion technology. Oleosins are plant-specific proteins with a structural role in lipid droplet formation and stabilization, which are used as carriers for recombinant proteins to lipid droplets in plant-based production systems. This study reports the efficient production of PAF102 in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> when fused to the rice plant Oleosin 18, whereas no accumulation of Cecropin A was detected. The Ole18-PAF102 fusion protein targets the lipid droplets of the heterologous system where it accumulates to high levels. Interestingly, the production of this fusion protein induces the formation of lipid droplets in yeast cells, which can be additionally enhanced by the coexpression of a diacylglycerol transferase gene that allows a three-fold increase in the production of the fusion protein. Using this high producer strain, PAF102 reaches commercially relevant yields of up to 180 mg/l of yeast culture. Moreover, the accumulation of PAF102 in the yeast lipid droplets facilitates its downstream extraction and recovery by flotation on density gradients, with the recovered PAF102 being biologically active against pathogenic fungi. Our results demonstrate that plant oleosin fusion technology can be transferred to the well-established <italic>P. pastoris</italic> cell factory to produce the PAF102 antifungal peptide, and potentially other AMPs, for multiple applications in crop protection, food preservation and animal and human therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>antimicrobial peptides</kwd><kwd>antifungal peptides</kwd><kwd><italic>Pichia pastoris</italic></kwd><kwd>plant oleosin</kwd><kwd>cecropin A</kwd><kwd>PAF peptides</kwd><kwd>lipid droplets</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="61"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are natural compounds with antimicrobial activity toward a wide range of fungi and bacteria. They are a diverse group of peptides with no consensus sequence associated to their biological activity but sharing common features: most of them are cationic, relatively hydrophobic and amphipathic molecules (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Zasloff, 2002</xref>). Being amphipathic facilitates their selective interaction with negatively charged microbial membranes, so are capable of functioning as membrane-disruption peptides or cell-penetrating peptides interfering with key intracellular processes (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Zasloff, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Nicolas, 2009</xref>). In general, AMPs seem to act on low-affinity targets, so with little propensity to develop resistance in microbial targets (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Zasloff, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hancock and Sahl, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Peschel and Sahl, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Sierra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Ghosh et al., 2019</xref>). The growing problem of resistance to conventional antibiotics together with the lack of new effective molecules has stimulated interest in developing AMPs as an alternative (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hancock and Sahl, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Gallo, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Ghosh et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, AMPs have different mechanisms of action to other antimicrobials, reinforcing their enormous potential as a complement to conventional antibiotics. They have multiple applications in medical therapies, food preservation and crop protection (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Marcos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-Garc&#x000ed;a et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Montesinos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although research on AMP development has been highly active recently, few molecules have entered the market. Major challenges to be solved before natural AMPs can be fully exploited relate to their target specificity and stability, as well as production costs. The advances in peptide synthesis have enabled the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis and rational design of AMPs with improved properties (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Marcos et al., 2008</xref>), with the hexapeptide PAF26 (RKKWFW) identified through a combinatorial approach as a novel peptide with specific antifungal activity and cell penetrating properties (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-Garc&#x000ed;a et al., 2002</xref>), and PAF102 rationally designed as a modified concatemer of PAF26 of 29 amino acid residues with high potency and specificity toward fungal cells, low toxicity to mammalian cells, high stability to proteolysis and for optimal production in plants (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-Garc&#x000ed;a et al., 2015</xref>). Other strategies are based on the modification of natural AMPs, such as the cecropin::melittin hybrids that are designed to decrease the toxicity of the high hemolytic melittin peptide (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Cavallarin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Badosa et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, some naturally occurring peptides, such as the 37 residues peptide cecropin A (CecA) isolated from insects, have potent lytic activity against major bacterial and fungal pathogens without additional modifications (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Steiner et al., 1981</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Cavallarin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Moreno et al., 2003</xref>). More importantly, CecA has no lytic activity against mammalian erythrocytes or lymphocytes (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Steiner et al., 1981</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Suttmann et al., 2008</xref>). These properties make this natural peptide a good candidate to be developed as an antimicrobial in multiple fields of applications.</p><p>The other major limitation for most AMPs is their production costs. The amount of AMPs produced in living organisms is very low, and their extraction and purification requires complex and costly procedures. Chemical synthesis is only economically viable for short peptides and high value applications. Their peptidic nature enables production through biotechnological systems, but, depending on the nature of the AMPs, their production in conventional microbial systems is frequently not very efficient due to toxicity toward host cells or proteolysis of the products (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Valore and Ganz, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Bryksa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, our group has demonstrated that rice seeds are good biofactories for linear AMPs that, otherwise, are difficult to produce in biological systems (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Bund&#x000f3; et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Montesinos et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). We found that, interestingly, PAF102 and CecA could be efficiently produced in rice seeds as oleosin fusion proteins targeted to oil bodies (OBs) (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Montesinos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Bund&#x000f3; et al., 2019</xref>). OBs, also known as lipid droplets (LDs), are specialized structures composed mainly of a core of neutral lipids (triacylglycerols and steryl esters) surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids containing a number of proteins that differ considerably between species (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Chapman et al., 2012</xref>). Oleosins are plant specific proteins with a structural role in OB formation and stabilization (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Tzen, 2012</xref>). They have been used as a carrier of recombinant proteins to OBs, facilitating their subsequent purification from plant material (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">van Rooijen and Moloney, 1995</xref>). Consequently, plant OBs have emerged as a target for biotechnological production of recombinant proteins (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Parmenter et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Nykiforuk et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Boothe et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether oleosin fusion technology could be transferred to the well-established production system based on <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> to efficiently produce AMPs. <italic>P. pastoris</italic> has been developed as an excellent host for the production of biopharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes. The growth of yeast is fast, with very high cell densities producing grams of recombinant protein per liter of culture (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Ahmad et al., 2014</xref>). Here, PAF102 was efficiently produced in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> when fused to the rice plant Oleosin 18, whereas no accumulation of CecA was detected. The plant oleosin was correctly targeted to the LDs in the heterologous system and carries the PAF102 peptide, leading to high accumulation of the fusion protein in these vesicles. Moreover, the recombinant LDs were easily isolated by flotation on density gradients for PAF102 purification. We also show that the recovered PAF102 was biologically active against pathogenic fungi. Our results demonstrate that <italic>P. pastoris</italic> allows fast and efficient production of AMPs through oleosin fusion technology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid Constructs, Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions</title><p>A construct was prepared to produce the fusion protein of Oleosin 18 to the Green Fluorescent Protein (Ole18-GFP) in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

Proteins were linked through a TEV protease recognition site for the subsequent release of the AMPs from the fusion protein. We also prepared an additional construct to produce the single Ole18 protein as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Transformed colonies were obtained for each construct, and integration of the transgenes was confirmed by PCR. Total protein extracts from the recombinant cultures grown in YPD media to the late logarithmic phase were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, right panels).

As a control, we also analyzed the Ole18-PAF102 fusion protein produced in rice seeds (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Bund&#x000f3; et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, Ole18-PAF102 remained stable after overnight incubation with the Pichia protein extracts.

In contrast, accumulation of Ole18-CecA is higher than Ole18-PAF102 in rice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), probably associated to a higher susceptibility of Ole18-PAF102 to rice proteases.

TEV protease was used to digest the recombinant LD fraction since the Ole18 and PAF102 polypeptides were linked through the TEV protease recognition site (PRS). In immunoblot analysis of LD fractions after proteolytic digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>), we observed that the fusion protein detected by anti-PAF102 antibodies was almost absent (upper panel), and a protein slightly larger than Ole18 appeared, recognized by anti-Ole18 antibodies (lower panel). After TEV protease digestion, most of the PRS remained attached to the Ole18 protein. This gives the Ole18 released from the fusion protein by TEV protease digestion a theoretical molecular weight of 18.25 kDa, whereas the single Ole18 is only 17.15 kDa. The bands detected in western-blot analysis are consistent with this difference in size and suggest that the fusion protein was processed by the TEV protease. Based on the disappearance of the fusion protein in different assays, the TEV protease efficiency was calculated at 86% &#x000b1; 10.5 on average. This data indicates a high efficiency of proteolytic processing of the fusion protein Ole18-PAF102 on intact LDs. We then investigated the presence of the PAF102 single peptide in the protease digested fractions. We immunodetected a polypeptide in the Ole18PAF102 LDs with similar mobility to the synthetic PAF102 (sPAF102) added to the EV LDs, or to the sPAF102 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). This band was not present in Ole18 LDs or in non-digested Ole18PAF102 LDs, indicating that the fusion protein was correctly processed and the PAF102 released.</p><p>To characterize the released PAF102 peptide, we tested the antifungal activity of the LDs fractions before and after TEV protease digestion.

This data indicates that the fusion protein Ole18-PAF102 was not active, at least when embedded into LDs. However, TEV protease digested Ole18-PAF102 LDs clearly inhibited the growth of <italic>F. proliferatum</italic>, and the inhibitory activity was equivalent to that of EV LDs supplemented with sPAF102 and incubated with TEV protease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). It is worth noting that the synthetic PAF102 was more active in the presence of EV LDs and TEV protease, completely inhibiting fungal growth at the even lower concentration of 0.25 &#x003bc;M. Given that Ole18 LDs and TEV protease did not have any inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>), TEV protease could be assisting PAF102 activity. Our results demonstrate that when PAF102 is produced in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> using the oleosin fusion technology, it is biologically active and equivalent to that produced by chemical synthesis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study reports that <italic>P. pastoris</italic> is an excellent cell factory for the fast and efficient biotechnological production of the antifungal PAF102 peptide, and probably other PAF peptides. The process developed here is an innovative system based on the plant oleosin fusion technology that we successfully transfer to the heterologous yeast system. It has so far been difficult to produce rationally designed PAF antifungal peptides in conventional microbial expression systems, probably due to toxicity toward host cells. We recently demonstrated that these bioactive peptides could be produced in plant biofactories as oleosin fusion proteins (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Bund&#x000f3; et al., 2019</xref>). The fusion of PAF102 to the rice Ole18 protein reduces its toxicity to the host cells allowing its accumulation to large amounts. We show here that the Ole18-PAF102 fusion protein is also produced in yeast cells and targeted to LDs where large amounts accumulate. By coexpressing the Arabidopsis <italic>Dgat1</italic> gene, <italic>P. pastoris</italic> cells produced up to 180 mg/l of PAF102 peptide in only 4 days. This yield was obtained from shake-flash cultures, and typically recombinant protein yield can be increased in fermenter cultures. This demonstrates that our new system is a considerable improvement on the previous rice-seed based system in terms of production times and yields of commercial relevance.</p><p>Nevertheless, the natural CecA peptide is not produced at detectable levels in this <italic>P. pastoris</italic> system, although it was efficiently produced in rice seeds when fused to Ole18, even to higher levels than PAF102 (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Montesinos et al., 2016</xref>). Recombinant protein production is not only dependent on gene expression and protein synthesis but also on its stability in host cells to allow its accumulation to significant amounts. Therefore, the lack of Ole18-CecA accumulation to detectable levels by immunoblot analysis might be due to instability in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> cells. Indeed, our results show that CecA is highly susceptible to the yeast proteases. In contrast, PAF102 seems to be more resistant to Pichia proteases and accumulates to high levels. Reports have been already published on the high susceptibility to proteolytic degradation of CecA by fungal proteases (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bland and Lucca, 1998</xref>) or of CecA-derived peptides by tobacco plant proteases (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Cavallarin et al., 1998</xref>). However, CecA stably accumulated in transgenic rice plants, suggesting limited proteolysis by rice proteases (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Coca et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Bund&#x000f3; et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Montesinos et al., 2016</xref>). This data indicates differential degradation of CecA by host proteases, with its stability varying from one system to another: the stability of CecA to protein extracts derived from the host system should first be tested when planning to produce CecA in a new system. Still, the use of protease-deficient strains might improve production of CecA in <italic>P. pastoris</italic>. These strains have been used for the production of protease-sensitive proteins with variable success depending on the proteases involved in the degradation events (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Ahmad et al., 2014</xref>). Our results suggest that the efficiency of the production system here developed would be dependent on the peptide to be produced.</p><p>Oleosin proteins have an important structural role in facilitating the formation and stability of plant LDs. They are small lipophilic proteins with a conserved central hydrophobic domain, inserted within the phospholipid bilayer of LDs, and two variable amphipathic N and C terminal domains covering the LD surface (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abell et al., 1997</xref>). Oleosins have an intrinsic affinity to membranes containing neutral lipids, associating spontaneously with them and assisting their sequestration into domains and ultimately in the formation of a particle filled with neutral lipids. Yeast LDs do not have similar structural proteins, but perform their functions properly (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Koch et al., 2014</xref>). However, oleosins from different plant species produced in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells target LDs and induce the formation of LDs (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Ting et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Jacquier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Jamme et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Vindigni et al., 2013</xref>). In agreement with these reports, rice Ole18 targets and stably accumulates in LDs in <italic>P. pastoris</italic>. The fusion of PAF102 to the Ole18 in the C-terminal also targets LDs, with the hydrophobic domain of Ole18 embedding into the TAG matrix and the PAF102 remaining on the surface. There were more and larger LDs in the cells accumulating the Ole18-PAF102 fusion protein than in those accumulating only the Ole18. It seems that the presence of PAF102 stabilizes the recombinant LDs and promotes their formation, probably due to the cationic and amphipathic character of PAF102 and its phospholipid affinity. This suggests that the oleosin fusion technology could be successfully applied to other AMPs with a similar cationic and amphipathic character.</p><p>A valuable addition to the production system is the coexpression of <italic>AtDagt1</italic> and <italic>Ole18-PAF102</italic> genes. <italic>AtDag1</italic> expression enhances the TAG content in yeast cells (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Bouvier-Nav&#x000e9; et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Aym&#x000e9; et al., 2014</xref>). This high content of TAG leads to overaccumulation of the Ole18-PAF102 fusion protein, resulting in high yields of the recombinant protein. This is consistent with the requirement of TAGs for the stable accumulation of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> Oleosin 1 in yeast cells (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Jacquier et al., 2013</xref>). Oleosin 1 was easily degraded in mutant strains of <italic>S. cerevisae</italic> deficient in TAGs that were not able to produce and to accumulate neutral lipids. In contrast, cells with a high content of TAGs offer sufficient anchoring surface for the Ole18-PAF102, providing stability and allowing the accumulation of very large amounts of the fusion protein. The yield could be further improved by using modified <italic>Dagt1</italic> genes to enhance the storage lipid content in yeast (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Greer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>One of the main advantages of the oleosin fusion technology is the simplicity of extraction and purification of the recombinant proteins accumulated in LDs from plant material. Similarly, <italic>P. pastoris</italic> LDs with the Ole18-PAF102 can be separated from other cellular components by simple flotation in density gradients. The yeast isolated LDs containing the Ole18-PAF102 had no activity against fungal targets, consistent with previous results with LDs from rice seeds (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Bund&#x000f3; et al., 2019</xref>). PAF102 is not active while immobilized in the LDs, requiring release from the Ole18 for activity. We speculate that this cell penetrating peptide cannot enter the fungal target cell while attached to LDs, a process that is necessary for its antifungal action (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Mu&#x000f1;oz et al., 2013</xref>). Once released from Ole18, PAF102 produced in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> was biologically active and indistinguishable from the synthetic peptide. PAF102 has potent activity against <italic>F. proliferatum</italic>, a plant pathogen that contaminates cereal grain with mycotoxins, reducing grain quality and causing severe economic losses (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Vismer et al., 2019</xref>). Here we demonstrate that biologically active PAF102 peptide can be produced quickly and efficiently in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> using the rice oleosin protein as a carrier to LDs.</p><p>Our results suggest that the oleosin fusion technology can be transferred to yeast cells for the production of recombinant proteins other than the AMPs here investigated. Particularly, we also successfully produced the GFP as an Ole18 fusion protein in <italic>P. pastoris.</italic> The main advantage of yeast over plant systems is the reduced production time. Oleosin technology in plants requires completion of the plant life cycle, since LDs are mainly accumulated in seeds: depending on the species, this could take several months whereas production in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> only requires several days. The production of other proteins should be evaluated to determine the robustness of the developed system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability</title><p>All datasets generated for this study are included in the manuscript and/or the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Files</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>MC conceived and designed this study.
