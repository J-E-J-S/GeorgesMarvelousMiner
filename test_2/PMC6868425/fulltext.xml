Here, we reported efficient genome engineering of an important industrial microorganism, <italic>Zymomonas mobilis</italic>, by repurposing the endogenous Type I-F CRISPR&#x02013;Cas system upon its functional characterization. This toolkit included a series of genome engineering plasmids, each carrying an artificial self-targeting CRISPR and a donor DNA for the recovery of recombinants. Through this toolkit, various genome engineering purposes were efficiently achieved, including knockout of <italic>ZMO0038</italic> (100% efficiency), <italic>cas2/3</italic> (100%), and a genomic fragment of &#x0003e;10 kb (50%), replacement of <italic>cas2/3</italic> with <italic>mCherry</italic> gene (100%), <italic>in situ</italic> nucleotide substitution (100%) and His-tagging of <italic>ZMO0038</italic> (100%), and multiplex gene deletion (18.75%) upon optimal donor size determination. Additionally, the Type I-F system was further applied for CRISPRi upon Cas2/3 depletion, which has been demonstrated to successfully silence the chromosomally integrated <italic>mCherry</italic> gene with its fluorescence intensity reduced by up to 88%. Moreover, we demonstrated that genome engineering efficiency could be improved under a restriction&#x02013;modification (R&#x02013;M) deficient background, suggesting the perturbance of genome editing by other co-existing DNA targeting modules such as the R&#x02013;M system. This study might shed light on exploiting and improving CRISPR&#x02013;Cas systems in other microorganisms for genome editing and metabolic engineering practices.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Key Technology Research and Development Program of China</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2018YFD0500203</award-id><award-id>2018YFA0900300</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Science Foundation of China</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id>31870057</award-id><award-id>21978071</award-id><award-id>U1932141</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100003819</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2017CFB538</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Hubei Provincial Department of Education</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100012554</named-content></funding-source><award-id>Q20161007</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Technical Innovation Special Fund of Hubei Province</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2019AHB055</award-id><award-id>2018ACA149</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Nearly 50% of bacteria and 90% of archaea equip themselves with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) adaptive immune systems to defend against invading genetic elements (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Six main types (Type I to VI) have been defined for various CRISPR&#x02013;Cas systems, which basically employ two classes of effector complexes to achieve interference. Class 1 systems involving Type I, III and IV encode multi-subunit effector complexes, and Class 2 systems involving Type II, V and VI have single-Cas machineries (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Despite of the diversity, the CRISPR&#x02013;Cas immunity is exclusively CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-based and Cas-driven, functioning in three distinct molecular steps: the integration of short DNA stretches (spacers) into the CRISPR array in a polarized manner (spacer adaptation), the processing of the CRISPR transcript into mature crRNAs (crRNA biogenesis), and the execution of the crRNA-guided target DNA/RNA destruction (target interference) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Class I systems naturally occur in more than 90% of sequenced genomes of bacteria and archaea (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Among them, the Type I systems, containing seven subtypes, <italic>i.e</italic>. I-A through I-F plus I-U are the most abundant, diverse and widespread in nature (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), and have been extensively studied in recent years. These systems encode the Cascade (CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defense) complex to bind to a <italic>bona fide</italic> target (protospacer) upon PAM (protospacer adjacent motif) recognition, and subsequently recruit the featuring Cas3 nuclease&#x02013;helicase to execute DNA cleavage (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Uniquely, the trans-acting nuclease-helicase in Type I-F systems is encoded as a Cas2&#x02013;Cas3 fusion, <italic>i.e</italic>. Cas2/3, whose activity is repressed by Cas1 and can be rescued by the target bound Type I-F Cascade (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). PAMs for Type I systems are found directly upstream of the target sequences in foreign DNAs (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and a 5&#x02032;-CC-3&#x02032; motif was previously proven to be a functional PAM for a Type I-F system (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Given the simplicity and programmability of Class 2 systems, CRISPR&#x02013;Cas9 and CRISPR&#x02013;Cas12a, for example, were widely developed as genome engineering tools in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, including human cells, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These systems have also been modified for applications beyond genome editing (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, Class 2 systems are relatively rare in nature, being found in fewer than 10% of sequenced prokaryotic genomes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Moreover, for the majority of prokaryotes, the exogenous Class 2 machineries are difficult to be exploited due to possibly their large size and severe toxicity to host cells (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), which has largely limited their applications in many alternative production hosts, especially some industrially important species, such as <italic>Zymomonas mobilis</italic>.</p><p>
<italic>Zymomonas mobilis</italic> is a facultative anaerobic ethanologen with many attractive physiological attributes. For instance, <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> is generally regarded as safe (GRAS), and capable of tolerating a high ethanol concentration up to 16% (v/v) and a broad pH range (3.5&#x02013;7.5) (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). It has evolved specifically to fit the high sugar and ethanol environment with unique physiological features such as a unique hopanoid membrane structure, a truncated tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) pathway, and an efficient Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In order to fully take the advantages of <italic>Z. mobilis</italic>&#x02019; capabilities in biorefinery (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) to fit the growing global demand for alternative sustainable biofuels and biochemicals, a series of genetic tools, including shutter vectors and transformation methods, have been explored (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Although the CRISPR&#x02013;Cas9-based toolkit has been used for plasmid clearance in <italic>Z. mobilis</italic>, there has not been any follow-up report on its application (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), indicative of uncertain factors for its further use in this species. Therefore, more readily useful high-throughput genetic engineering toolkits are needed for performing effective genome editing in <italic>Z. mobilis</italic>.</p><p>In recent years, several endogenous Type I CRISPR&#x02013;Cas systems, including I-A (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), I-B (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref>), and I-E (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), have been harnessed as an alternative strategy to study prokaryotic engineering in archaea and bacteria. For example, the native Type I-B system of <italic>Clostridium pasteurianum</italic> facilitated efficient genome editing of around 4 folds more than that of the heterologously expressed Cas9 system (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Very recently, the Type I-E system of <italic>Lactobacillus crispatus</italic> has been exploited for genome editing including gene knockout, knockin and point mutation (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), which further highlighted the usefulness of native Type I CRISPR&#x02013;Cas system for <italic>in situ</italic> genome modification. In addition, the Type I-B of <italic>Haloferax volcanii</italic> (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and Type I-E of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) systems were harnessed for efficient repression of transcription upon Cas3 depletion. However, to the best of our knowledge, very few native CRISPR-based toolkits were developed for non-model industrial microorganisms. Furthermore, to date there has not been any report on the exploitation of the Type I-F CRISPR&#x02013;Cas, a close cousin of Type I-E, for genome manipulation application yet, although Type I-F is among the most well-studied CRISPR&#x02013;Cas systems.</p><p>In this study, we characterized the DNA interference capability of the Type I-F CRISPR&#x02013;Cas system in <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> ZM4. Upon the characterization, an efficient native Type I-F CRISPR-based genome editing toolkit was established to fulfil diverse genome engineering purposes, including gene deletion and replacement (100% efficiency), <italic>in situ</italic> modifications (100%), large fragment (of &#x0003e;10 kb, ca. 5&#x02030; of the genome) deletion (50%), and simultaneous multiple gene editing (18.75%). Efficient gene repression by programming the Type I-F system was also achieved. This work thus provided a versatile and powerful genetic manipulation toolkit for the development and further improvement of <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> as an ideal chassis for biorefinery and synthetic biology studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Strains, growth conditions and electroporation transformation of <italic>Z. mobilis</italic></title><p>

Oligonucleotides were designed to bear the entire sequences of the selected spacers following a 5&#x02032;-CCC-3&#x02032; PAM or the last three nucleotides of the repeat (5&#x02032;-AAA-3&#x02032;). Each set of oligonucleotides was annealed by first being heated to 95&#x000b0;C for 5 min and subsequently cooled down gradually to room temperature, followed by double digestion using XbaI and EcoRI. These DNA fragments were ligated with the XbaI and EcoRI linearized vector (pEZ15Asp, an <italic>E. coli</italic>&#x02013;<italic>Z. mobilis</italic> shuttle vector (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>)), yielding the interference plasmids (pInt plasmids) and the corresponding reference plasmids (pRef plasmids). All plasmids were listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>.</p><p>Artificial CRISPR expression plasmids were constructed based on the pEZ15Asp vector in this study. A DNA block consisting of the leader sequence of the chromosomal CRISPR2 as a promoter and two CRISPR repeats spaced by two BsaI restriction sequences in opposite orientation was firstly synthesized from GenScript (Nanjing, China), and used as a template for PCR amplification with the primer pair of L2R-XbaI-F/l2R-EcoRI-R (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Then, the PCR product was digested with XbaI and EcoRI and subsequently inserted into the pEZ15Asp vector, generating the base vector pL2R. Digestion of pL2R with BsaI generated a linearized plasmid having protruding repeat sequences of 4 nt at both ends. Double-stranded spacer DNAs were prepared by annealing two spacer oligonucleotides through being heated to 95&#x000b0;C for 5 min followed by cooling down gradually to room temperature. The spacer fragments were designed to carry 4 nt protruding ends complementary to those in the linearized pL2R.</p><p>Therefore, plasmids each bearing an artificial mini-CRISPR with a self-targeting spacer were generated by individually ligating the spacer inserts with the linearized pL2R vector. Subsequently, donor DNA fragments each containing a mutant allele of a target gene were generated by splicing and overlap extension PCR (SOE-PCR) (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and individually cloned into their cognate pST plasmids through the T5 exonuclease-dependent DNA assembly (TEDA) method (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), yielding the all-in-one genome engineering plasmids listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>.

Sequences of three spacers showed significant matches to putative protospacers present in plasmids of <italic>Zymomonas</italic> or <italic>Escherichia</italic> species (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The three spacers occur exclusively in the CRISPR3 locus, designated C3S1, C3S2 and C3S6 for Spacer1, 2 and 6 of CRISPR3, respectively, exhibiting high sequence identity to their corresponding putative protospacers, ranging from 87.5% to 100%. The 32-nt C3S2 sequence perfectly matched sequences carried by two plasmids of <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> NCIMB11163, pZMO1A (NC_019198) and pZMO1B (NC_019210.1), while had a single mismatch at position 31 to the sequence in the pZMO1 (NC_011363.1) plasmid of <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> ATCC10988. Identical protospacer sequences of the 33-nt C3S6 were also detected in both plasmids pZMO1 and pAK51, carrying one mismatch to C3S6 at position 14. As for the 32-nt C3S1, a putative protospacer was seen in a plasmid of <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> ZM4, pZZM401 (NC_013784.1), with two mismatching nucleotides at positions 5 and 13 in the 5&#x02032;-part sequence.

We found two small RNA molecules containing Spacer1 of CRISPR2 (C2S1) and Spacer4 of CRISPR3 (C3S4) in the transcriptomic data. They were identified to be Type I effector-associated mature crRNAs produced by Cas6 homologues (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) as both of which possess the typical feature: an intact spacer sequence with an 8-nt repeat-derived handle and a 20-nt repeat sequence (the reminder) located at the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; termini, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). These findings indicated the effective expression of Cas6 for processing the CRISPR transcripts into mature crRNAs (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Since the <italic>cas6</italic> gene is located at the farthest end of the <italic>cas</italic> operon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), its expression could reflect the expression of all other <italic>cas</italic> genes. These results were further confirmed using the datasets from previous microarray and RNA-Seq studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Under different strain background and growth conditions, the Type I-F <italic>cas</italic> genes were constitutively expressed, among which the expression levels of <italic>cas1</italic> and <italic>cas2/3</italic> were slightly lower than the mean and median values of all genes, while those of the <italic>csy</italic> genes (<italic>cas5&#x02013;cas8</italic>) were significantly above the mean and median values of all genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-2"><title>Demonstration of the DNA targeting activity of the Type I-F system of <italic>Z. mobilis</italic></title><p>To test the DNA targeting capability of the Type I-F system of <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> ZM4, we employed a plasmid interference assay since it could efficiently express the protospacer-matching crRNA and be eliminated from the cells afterwards (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Two interference plasmids were generated with one containing C2S7 protospacer (pInt-C2S7) and the other containing C3S4 protospacer (C3S4) using a functional 5&#x02032;-C<underline>CC</underline>-3&#x02032; PAM sequence (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) based on the <italic>E. coli</italic>&#x02013;<italic>Z. mobilis</italic> shuttle vector pEZ15Asp (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). For the corresponding reference plasmids (pRef-C2S7 and pRef-C3S4), the PAM sequence was replaced with the last 3 nt of the repeat to mimic the genetic structure of CRSIPR arrays in the genome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Upon introducing the plasmid constructs into <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> cells, hundreds-fold lower transformation rates were obtained with pInt-C2S7 or pInt-C3S4 than those with reference plasmids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>), suggesting that the interference plasmids triggered much stronger defense responses than those of reference plasmids. The effectiveness of C3S4 and C2S7 further confirmed the transcription and processing of the CRISPR loci, and revealed that a spacer with a length of 34 bp could work as well as the predominant 32-bp ones. Moreover, these results confirmed that a 5&#x02032;-C<underline>CC</underline>-3&#x02032; motif is a functional PAM sequence and more importantly demonstrated the DNA targeting activity of the Type I-F CRISPR&#x02013;Cas system, which had the potential to be hijacked for genome engineering in all <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> species.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-3"><title>Determination of PAMs required for the Type I-F CRISPR immunity in <italic>Z. mobilis</italic></title><p>Although the 5&#x02032;-C<underline>CC</underline>-3&#x02032; PAM sequence was confirmed to be functional, it remained unclear whether there are other functional PAMs for the Type I-F system.

DNA fragments were generated bearing C3S4 preceded by trinucleotide combinations and were individually cloned to the pEZ15Asp vector. Together with 5'-CCC-3'&#x000a0;in pInt-C3S4 and 5'-AAA-3' in pRef-C3S4 constructed previously, a total of 64 different candidate PAM sequences were evaluated. These plasmid constructs, as well as the vector pEZ15Asp as a reference, were then individually introduced into the host cells.</p><p>Transformation rates significantly varied with plasmids containing different PAM sequences adjacent to C3S4, which were presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> as relative transformation efficiencies to that of the vector pEZ15Asp (set to 1.0). These PAM sequences can be artificially categorized into four groups. In Group 1, plasmids contained any of the 5&#x02032;-NCC-3&#x02032; sequences as a PAM got extremely lowered transformation rates (more than 1,000-fold decrease), indicating that very strong defense reaction was triggered (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). This is consistent with previous bioinformatic prediction (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and experimental observations (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In Group 2, plasmids with 5&#x02032;-AAG-3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-ATT-3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-CTT-3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-CGA-3&#x02032; or 5&#x02032;-ACT-3&#x02032;, exhibited an around 10-fold reduction in transformation rates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In Group 3, plasmids with ten other 3-nt motifs, <italic>i.e</italic>. 5&#x02032;-ATG-3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-ACA-3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-ACG-3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-TCT-3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-TGG-3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-CTA-3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-GAA-3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-GAT-3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-GTA-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-GGG-3&#x02032;, also had effect on triggering CRISPR targeting but showed less than 4-fold drop in transformation rates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The trinucleotides in the rest plasmids (Group 4) were not considered as functional PAM sequences because transformation with plasmids carrying any of them yielded transformation rates at a similar level with that of the vector pEZ15Asp (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>).

Reasonably, the dinucleotide 5&#x02032;-CC-3&#x02032; (actually 5&#x02032;-NCC-3&#x02032;) could work functionally (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Effects of PAMs on triggering target attack by the Type I-F CRISPR&#x02013;Cas system of <italic>Z. mobilis</italic>.&#x000a0;Plasmid interference assay was performed as depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>.

The corresponding protospacer in pHT-<italic>ZMO0038</italic> was designed to follow a 5&#x02032;-TCC-3&#x02032; PAM, and this plasmid also carried a donor DNA that was designed to include the sequences surrounding the target site, where a 6x His tag was introduced immediately downstream of the start codon to interrupt the 5&#x02032;-TCC-3&#x02032; PAM (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).

Like the Type I-A of <italic>S. islandicus</italic> (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and the Type I-E of <italic>L. crispatus</italic> (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), the Type I-F CRISPR&#x02013;Cas system of <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> is constitutively expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>) and hence is ready-to-be-harnessed for genome engineering. By using this toolkit, genome engineering options, including gene or genomic fragment knockout, insertion or replacement, <italic>in situ</italic> tagging and specific point mutagenesis, and multiplexed gene deletion, can be readily achieved in <italic>Z. mobilis</italic>, representing thus far the most efficient and straightforward genome engineering toolkit for this important industrial microorganism. When compared with the currently routinely used genetic manipulation methods in <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), this CRISPR-based toolkit is much simpler, more convenient and time-saving. For instance, due to the strong selection pressure conferred by CRISPR-targeting, no additional selection marker is required, and each edit with desired mutation has been obtained from transformants generated in a single round of transformation. The CRISPR-based toolkit established here will facilitate future effective and efficient genome editing to help understand the effect of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on microbial phenotypic improvement and unravel the underlying mechanism of inhibitor tolerance and stress responses (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), which were not able to be easily achieved by other classical genetics approaches. This toolkit might also expedite the development of <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> as a synthetic chassis for sustainable economic biofuel and biochemical productions. More importantly, our work here, and others&#x02019; (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;22</xref>), have provided a framework for exploiting endogenous CRISPR&#x02013;Cas systems, which widely occur in bacteria and archaea, for genome engineering in their native hosts, and will prompt the development of native CRISPR-based next-generation genome engineering technologies.</p><p>Due to lack of an efficient non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) system in most prokaryotes, repair of DNA injuries introduced by CRISPR-directed chromosomal self-targeting in bacteria and archaea mainly relies on the homologous recombination (HR) pathway, where episomal templates are generally required. Therefore, the concentration and stability of DNA templates would determine the homologous recombination rate after DNA injuries. Indeed, chemical modification of the DNA template was observed to dramatically enhance the HR rate by increasing the stability of the DNA template (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). In addition, supplying DNA templates as inserts of plasmids allows their multiplication through plasmid replication, thus conferring more efficient genome editing than as free DNA fragments (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). By taking the similar approach, we achieved deletion of &#x0003e;10 kb genomic fragment, which might provide an efficient method for future construction of minimal microbial genome of <italic>Z. mobilis</italic>. In addition, recombination between identical sequences resulted in internal deletions (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), indicating a microhomology-directed homologous recombination mechanism. Using the same mechanism, deletion of &#x0003e;50 kb genomic fragment was achieved in <italic>S. islandicus</italic> (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Moreover, other mechanisms, <italic>e.g</italic>. the Ligase A-dependent alternative end-joining (A-EJ) first demonstrated for <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), may also potentiate the CRISPR-based toolkit for the removal of large genomic fragments.</p><p>Escape from CRISPR-targeting was observed in our studies. The escape modes and the underlying mechanisms would provide possibility for further boosting the overall engineering efficiency. We found that all escaping transformants still harbored an engineering plasmid that conferred the cells antibiotics resistance, while the genome-targeting spacer was deleted in most cells (&#x0003e;70% of the escaping transformants). This was possibly caused by the homologous recombination between direct repeats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>) as reported in other studies (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). The escape from CRISPR-targeting is particularly evident in the plasmid for multiplex genome engineering (pMGE-Cs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). It could be speculated that two more direct repeats present in pMGE-Cs compared to other engineering plasmids could improve the recombination possibility and led to various deletion modes. Such an issue might be addressed by producing mature crRNAs through a Cas6-independent pathway, where each crRNA was generated by processing the fusing t-elements by RNase P and tRNase Z (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Nevertheless, using a single CRISPR array containing tandem repeat-spacer units, all the engineering purposes were obtainable with a considerably high efficiency. In our studies, we carefully examined the sequences of the CRISPR repeats and spacers on the plasmid, and the protospacers and PAMs in the genome. No change in any of these regions was observed (data not shown). Further work can be carried out to identify the exact mutations in the <italic>cas</italic> operon (ca. 8 kb). However, it should not affect our purpose to select the candidates with correct editing since the escaping transformants occurred in a small percentage (&#x0003c;30%).</p><p>Apart from the different <italic>cas2/3</italic> knockouts obtained using the Type I-F CRISPR-based genome engineering toolkit in this study, we also successfully introduced nucleotide substitutions at an HD-active site of the Cas2/3 nuclease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). The nucleotide substitutions were introduced without disrupting the target sequence of the designed crRNA guide, due to the lack of any suitable 5&#x02032;-NCC-3&#x02032; PAM that could render the changes within the target (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Instead, the nucleotide substitutions resulted in inactivation of the nuclease activity of Cas2/3 and hence the DNA interference function of the Type I-F CRISPR&#x02013;Cas system, which thus allowed the screening and obtaining of the intended dCas2/3 mutant. Given the determination of PAM sequences, it would be possible to use alternative PAMs, such as those in Group 2 or 3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), in genome engineering assays where no Group 1 PAM could be used. Also, it would be also good to introduce a silent mutation into the target sequence along with the intended mutations to yield edits with desired phenotypes as previously conducted (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>).</p><p>Our results also demonstrated that the Type I-F Cascade without Cas2/3 can be directed to a targeted gene sequence, acting as a transcriptional barrier, for efficient <italic>in vivo</italic> gene silencing in <italic>Z. mobilis</italic>. It was reported that while the Type I-B system in <italic>Haloferax volcanii</italic> was harnessed for efficient repression of transcription upon the depletion of Cas3, the expression of a catalytically inactive Cas3 via plasmid gave a further enhanced knockdown effect on an endogenous gene (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), which might suggest the help of a dCas3 on stabilizing the target-bound Cascade. Additionally, upon being fused with the bacterial RNAP activator SoxS, the dCas2/3 constructed could be used to recruit RNAP for transcription activation, which is in parallel with the functions of dCas9/dCas12a in Class 2 systems (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Collectively, the native CRISPR-dCas2/3 system can be employed as CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and activation (CRISPRa) toolkits or similarly as CRISPR-assisted multi-dimensional regulation tool for fine-tuning gene expression (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>) and metabolic engineering in <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> and related microorganisms in the future.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that the enhancement of plasmid DNA transformation efficiencies through inactivating the Type IV DNA R&#x02013;M system in <italic>Z. mobilis</italic> led to boosted genome engineering efficiencies of up to 100% (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Multiplexed gene deletion, which we failed for several attempts in the wild-type strain, was achieved with a considerably high efficiency under this R&#x02013;M<sup>&#x02212;</sup> background. R&#x02013;M systems naturally occur in prokaryotes even more broadly than CRISPR&#x02013;Cas systems, pointing towards a fact that both adaptive CRISPR&#x02013;Cas immune systems and innate R&#x02013;M systems may coexist in many bacteria and archaea (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Thus, it may explain the perplexity that the diverse CRISPR&#x02013;Cas systems broadly occur in prokaryotes in nature whereas the native CRISPR-based technologies are much lesser applied. Possibly, highly efficient native CRISPR-based genome engineering in these bacteria and archaea would be only enabled under, at least, an R&#x02013;M<sup>&#x02212;</sup> background. In addition, other prokaryotic defense modules that also prevent foreign DNA introduction (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>) would be taken account as well if occurred. Together, the method developed here may serve as an important reference for the development and deployment of similar toolkits in prokaryotes that harbour active endogenous CRISPR&#x02013;Cas systems but with low efficiency in the wild-type genetic background.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>gkz940_Supplemental_File</label><media xlink:href="gkz940_supplemental_file.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ACK1"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>
