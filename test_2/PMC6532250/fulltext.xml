As bovine milk contains OS with somewhat similar structures and functionalities there is increased interest in further understanding the genetic basis underlying the OS content of milk for eventual extraction and generation of value-added ingredients for infant formulas and nutraceuticals. The present study is the first to report on genetic parameter estimation as well as on a genome wide association study (GWAS) from the largest bovine milk OS dataset analyzed to date.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">In total 15 different bovine milk OS were monitored. Heritabilities ranged from 0 to 0.68 in Danish Holstein and from 0 to 0.92 in Danish Jersey. The GWAS identified in total 1770 SNPs (FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.10) for five different OS in Danish Holstein and 6913 SNPs (FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.10) for 11 OS in Danish Jersey. In Danish Holstein, a major overlapping QTL was identified on BTA1 for LNH and LNT explaining 24% of the variation in these OS. The most significant SNPs were associated with <italic>B3GNT5</italic>, a gene encoding a glycosyltransferase involved in glycan synthesis. In Danish Jersey, a very strong QTL was detected for the OS with composition 2 Hex 1 HexNAc (isomer 1) on BTA11. The most significant SNP had &#x02013;log<sub>10</sub>(<italic>P</italic>-value) of 52.88 (BOVINEHD1100030300) and was assigned to <italic>ABO</italic>, a gene encoding ABO blood group glycosyltransferases. This SNP has been reported to be a missense mutation and explains 56% of the OS variation.

The underlying biosynthetic steps of OS in the mammary gland are still largely unknown, but genes encoding glycosyltransferases, glycosidases and sugar transporters are expected to play a role. In light of such numerous health benefits attributed to these molecules, recent studies have set out to characterize the structures and bioactivities of free bovine OS in milk and in dairy streams, and further to develop processing techniques that would allow these molecules to be isolated and used as food ingredients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Despite some differences in abundance, structural complexity, and diversity between human and bovine OS, bovine milk contains several OS structures in common with human milk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, their utility as health-promoting bioactive compounds has been demonstrated in a recent study showing improvements in metabolism and physical development when animal models of infant under-nutrition were fed diets supplemented with bovine milk OS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Given the vast amount of whey originating from cheese production, recovery and up-concentration of bovine milk OS from dairy streams could be a valuable source of OS for use as bioactive ingredients, especially for the purposes of enhancing the functionalities of infant formula and developing value-added ingredients for nutraceutical applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Bovine milk OS are generally smaller in size than those of human milk, with less complex structures and fewer isomers for each composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Milk OS are synthesized from glucose (Glc), galactose (Gal), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), fucose (Fuc), N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], likely by the action of specific glycosyltransferases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Early studies on bovine OS focused on bovine colostrum and early lactation milk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Studies on mature bovine milk documented decreased OS abundance from early to mid-lactation, and showed that acidic (sialic acid-containing) OS decreased more rapidly compared to the neutral OS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In a small set of milk samples from Danish Holstein (DH) and Danish Jersey (DJ) cattle, differences in OS abundances were found between breeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. OS in milk from DJ cows contained higher relative amounts of both sialylated and the more complex neutral fucosylated OS, whereas milk from DH had a higher abundance of smaller and simpler neutral OS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. That study also revealed that bovine milk contains several larger fucosylated structures (containing up to 10 monosaccharide units) and not just simple OS as previously thought.</p><p id="Par6">Wickramasinghe et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] examined expression of glycosylation-related genes by sequencing of RNA extracted from milk somatic cells at day 15 and 250 in lactation from three Holstein and three Jersey cows. They revealed no significant difference in expressions of glycosylation-related genes between the two breeds. However, out of 121 genes examined, 92 were expressed in the milk somatic cells and most of these exhibited higher expression at 250&#x02009;days of milking compared with early lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. They found 29 genes to be important for the synthesis of sialylated OS, and 70 genes of importance for the synthesis of fucosylated OS, suggesting that the abundances of both of these OS classes are genetically influenced. The use of genome wide association studies (GWAS) to explore genetic influence underlying the variation in bovine milk OS has, to our knowledge, not been documented before. This most likely relates to the need for highly advanced analytical techniques that are both high-throughput and sensitive enough for quantifying low-abundance bovine milk OS. We have used isobaric tags for an optimized mass spectrometry-based OS quantification method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], which has enabled relative OS quantification in more than 600 milk samples from DH and DJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The results confirmed that DJ milk contains higher amounts of most bovine OS. In both breeds, variation in OS abundance was strongly affected by parity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The aim of the present study was to estimate genetic parameters and conduct a GWAS in order to examine whether OS in DH and DJ milk are heritable and to identify underlying single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers affecting OS variation in bovine dairy breeds.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Variation in oligosaccharides between breeds</title><p id="Par7">In Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the relative phenotypic mean, standard deviations and CVs for the OS in milk of DH and DJ measured by Nano-LC Chip Q-ToF are presented.

Seven OS in DH and eight in DJ had moderate to high heritabilities (h<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.4). For some OS the same trend was found in DH and DJ: most notably the low to insignificant heritabilities for the acidic OS were evident in both breeds. This suggests that the content of sialylated OS cannot be improved through selective breeding. However, this result does not represent a concern because bovine milk already contains a high proportion of sialylated OS (70% in colostrum and 50% in mature milk, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]), while fucosylated OS abundance is rather low. To better mimic the composition of human milk, increasing the content of more complex and lower-abundance fucosylated OS should be of interest. Several of the neutral non-fucosylated OS (including LNT and LNH), as well as fucosylated neutral OS (especially 3 Hex 6 HexNAc 1 Fuc and 5 Hex 4 HexNAc 1 Fuc), display moderate to high heritabilities, suggesting a good potential to increase the content of these specific OS and improve the commercial sourcing potential of bovine milk. The higher content of OS in DJ milk and higher heritabilities for some OS compared to DH suggests that DJ cows may be the breed of choice for customizing OS production such that the OS ensemble more closely resembles human milk.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>QTL and candidate genes for oligosaccharides</title><p id="Par24">Free milk OS synthesis is very complex: a literature review has identified more than 121 glycosylation-related genes which included several glycosyltransferases, glycosidases and glycan transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The concerted action of various glycosyltransferases is likely needed for OS synthesis. In human and bovine milk, most OS contain lactose at the reducing end, which can be elongated with lacto-N-biose or N-acetyllactosamine and further sialylated or fucosylated at the terminal end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It has been postulated that milk OS are formed through modification of lactose by glycosyltransferases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], but the specific enzymatic pathways are still largely uncharacterized. Transcriptome profiling of bovine milk OS has confirmed expression of several glycosylation-related genes in RNA extracted from milk somatic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], which provides a list of possible candidate genes. These studies in conjunction with GWAS could substantially contribute to further elucidating OS synthetic pathways. In the present study, the number of significant SNPs were almost fourfold higher in DJ than in DH. For both breeds, the low heritabilities for acidic OS were reflected in a lack of significant SNPs detected, suggesting very limited genetic influence on the variation of these OS. In contrast, 2 Hex 1 HexNAc isomer 1, 3 Hex 2 HexNAc, 3 Hex 6 HexNAc 1 Fuc, and 5 Hex 4 HexNAc 1 Fuc show moderate to high heritabilities. These OS have no or very few significant SNPs detected in DH, probably indicating a more polygenic influence of these specific OS. The results in DJ indicate that the genetic background for the fucosylated OS are under the same regulation with a high number of significant SNPs shared. As this was also true for 5 Hex 4 HexNAc, this could indicate that this relatively complex OS is dependent on some of the same pathways during synthesis, as a positive rather than a negative correlation was observed between 5 Hex 4 HexNAc and the fucosylated OS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title><italic>B3GNT5</italic> in Danish Holstein</title><p id="Par25">The most promising QTL in DH is on BTA1 and identified for LNT and LNH. The three top SNPs were shared for both OS and were assigned to <italic>B3GNT5</italic>. This gene encodes a specific glycosyltransferase, &#x003b2;3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases, which is an enzyme catalyzing the elongation of a glycan by adding a &#x003b2;-N-acetylglucosamine residue at the C3 position of galactose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This feature is present in both LNT and LNH, and the gene is therefore a very strong candidate gene for the synthesis of these OS structures. The significant SNPs for both OS assigned to <italic>B3GNT5</italic> are all listed as intronic variants, and a deeper exploration of the region and the traits association is thus needed to establish the direct relationship. The gene was found only to be weakly expressed in the study by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Other candidate genes in Danish Holstein</title><p id="Par26">Apart from <italic>B3GNT5</italic> in DH, several other less significant candidate genes were also detected (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). For LNT and LNH, significant SNPs were assigned to the <italic>ALG3</italic> gene within the same QTL as <italic>B3GNT5</italic> on BTA1. The gene encodes &#x003b1;-1,3-mannosyltransferase, which is an enzyme responsible for the addition of mannose in an &#x003b1;-1,3-linkage to GlcNAc. Mannose has not been identified in free milk OS, but in N-linked glycans, where the glycan chain is covalently bound to asparagine residues, the basic core structure is rich in mannose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and ALG3 plays a central role in the synthesis of the N-linked core moiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Thus, <italic>ALG3</italic> is not expected to play a role for free OS in milk, unless there is a stronger connection identified between the synthesis of free and bound glycans in milk. For LNH, significant SNPs on BTA23 were assigned to <italic>LOC520336</italic>, which is most likely a gene encoding another glycosyltransferase, N-acetyllactosaminide-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase. This enzyme specifically catalyzes the bonding of N-acetylglucosamine to the Gal of N-acetyllactosamine in a 1,6 linkage. LNT is a linear oligosaccharide having only 1 N-acetylglucosamine attached, in comparison to the branched LNH containing 2 N-acetylglucosamine residues. However, as the additional N-acetylglucosamine in LNH is attached to Gal of the lactose, and not to the N-acetyllactosamine, the association to this enzyme is not clear. For 5 Hex 4 HexNAc, significant SNPs assigned to the gene <italic>B3GALNT</italic> on BTA 28 were detected. This gene encodes another glycosyltransferase, &#x003b2;-1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltranseferase. This suggests that at least one of the 4 N-acetylhexosamines within the structure of this OS is an N-acetylgalactosamine. For 4 Hex 1 HexNAc, significant SNPs assigned to the gene <italic>GLT6G1</italic> on BTA11 were detected. This gene encodes another glycosyltransferase gene family related to the ABO blood type system, and will be discussed in more detail for DJ below, where <italic>ABO</italic> is identified as a candidate gene.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>ABO in Danish Jersey</title><p id="Par27">In DJ, a major QTL was identified on BTA11 for 2 Hex 1 HexNAc isomer 1 and had 19 SNPs assigned to the <italic>ABO</italic> gene. This gene is involved in the ABO blood type system. In cattle, the blood type system is more complex and includes more factors than those observed in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In humans, variation in the gene affects the expression of different transferases. Type A individuals express &#x003b1;-1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, type B individuals express &#x003b1;-1,3-galactosyltransferase, type AB individuals express both of these, and type O individuals express neither [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The action of these two glycosyltransferases results in the transformation of the H antigen into A or B antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The molecular background in humans is related to a few SNPs changing four amino acid residues in the transferase, whereas a single base deletion results in the inactive gene defining type O(H) individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The ABO system in humans relates to the secretor system, as the A and B transferases can only function when at least one &#x003b1;-1,2-fucosyltransferase is active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The bovine ABH blood type system may be different from the human ABO and have other substrate specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The OS 2 Hex 1 HexNAc isomer 1 does not contain fucose, which may suggest that the action of the ABO gene is not dependent on the same substrate as in humans. The structural analysis of the 2 Hex 1 HexNAc isomer 1 revealed an &#x003b1;-1,3 linkage of N-acetylgalactosamine to lactose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], which indicates action of transferase A. The most significant SNP assigned to the ABO gene was reported as a missense mutation, which potentially could affect the protein function directly. It is very rare for a GWAS study in cattle to identify strong candidate genes within QTLs and even rarer that the study would identify genetic variation potentially affecting the trait of interest through changed protein functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Further studies should enable establishment of a direct link between the mutation and variation in 2 Hex 1 HexNAc isomer 1. The paralogous <italic>GLT6D1</italic> gene is located in very close proximity to the <italic>ABO</italic> gene on BTA11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This gene encodes another glycosyltransferase, with a yet unknown catalytic specificity. However, the gene and its location in close proximity to the <italic>ABO</italic> gene is highly conserved across species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and, interestingly, it was detected as a candidate gene in both DH and DJ. In a study using the same DH samples from the current study for a GWAS of milk metabolites, a significant QTL for glucose on BTA11 was located between <italic>LOC100848307</italic> and <italic>ABO</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], suggesting some association between free glucose in milk and ABO. This may indicate an association between the levels of free monosaccharides and free oligosaccharides in milk. In close proximity to this major QTL on BTA11, significant SNPs were assigned to the gene <italic>ST6GALNAC6</italic>. This gene encodes ST6 N-acetylgalactosaminide &#x003b1;-2,6-sialyltransferase 6, an enzyme belonging to sialyltransferase family, which probably catalyses the addition of sialic acid to a N-acetylgalactosamine through an &#x003b1;-2,6 linkage. As 2 Hex 1 HexNAc is not sialylated, the association could relate to enzymes competing for the same substrate (e.g. lactose or more complex OS), and a lower activity of <italic>ST6GALNAC6</italic> could thus lead to increased content of 2 Hex 1 HexNAc. Expression of <italic>ST6GALNAC6</italic> has been reported earlier in Jersey and Holstein cows, but only <italic>ST6GALNAC2</italic> and <italic>ST6GALNAC5</italic> displayed significant change in expression from early to mid-lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Candidate genes for fucosylated OS in Danish Jersey</title><p id="Par28">For the fucosylated OS a high number of significant SNPs were detected.

Apart from the fucosylated OS, significant SNPs for 5 Hex 4 HexNAc were also assigned to this gene. Compared to human milk OS, where the only HexNAc moiety is N-acetylglucosamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], bovine milk OS also contains N-acetylgalactosamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and the association between complex OS and <italic>GALNT17</italic> in the current study could indicate that that the elongation of more complex OS structures in bovine milk are related to N-acetylgalactosamine. Furthermore, for 4 Hex 4 HexNAc 1 Fuc and 5 Hex 4 HexNAc 1 Fuc another significant SNP on BTA25 was assigned to <italic>LFNG</italic>, a candidate gene encoding O-fucosylpeptide 3-beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase.

These include <italic>MAN1C1</italic>, encoding mannosidase alpha class 1C member 1, and PIGV, encoding phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class V. Mannosidase is a glycosidase involved in the maturation and trimming of N-linked glycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], where the core structure contains several mannose residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. <italic>PIGV</italic> encodes a mannosyltransferase involved in involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), which is a membrane anchor for e.g. N-linked glycosylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This again suggests that there could be a close relationship between the free OS and various glycoconjugates. For LNT, significant SNPs were also assigned to <italic>GALNT14</italic> within the detected BTA11 QTL, which is a gene encoding polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 14. This galactosaminyl transferase catalyses the addition N-acetylgalactosamine at especially serine and threonine positions in proteins and peptides and is thus involved in the formation of O-linked glycans, which have a core structure containing 1 N-acetylgalactosamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] linked to target Ser or Thr residues in the protein skeleton. How this relates to LNT is less clear, but again indicates a relation between free OS and glycoconjugates.
