In theory, existing methods for assigning sequences to individual species from metagenome samples could be used to separate subgenomes in polyploid organisms, however, these methods rely on differences in coarse genome properties like GC content or sequences from related species.

Current approaches consist of either supervised binning, requiring a database of known genomes, or unsupervised binning using general genome characteristics as a &#x02018;genome signature&#x02019; to identify and separate DNA sequences from different species/subgenomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Genome signatures can be any kind of bias (e.g. similarity to known sequences, short nucleic acid sequences, GC content, sequence depth) that differs between genomes. In particular, di- and tetra-nucleotide frequencies along with contig co-abundance (a given species may have a distinct abundance relative to others in a metagenome sample) can be used to successfully bin sequences within metagenomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These coarse approaches work best with highly divergent taxa and there is much room for improvement in sensitivity and accuracy when grouping sequences appropriately at the species level. Furthermore, subgenomes within allopolyploids have the same sequence depth profile and similar di- and tetra-nucleotide frequencies, making these features uninformative. In fact, orthologous gene sequences between the subgenomes in an allopolyploid (homeologous sequences) are far more similar to each other than they are to other sequences within the same subgenome.</p><p id="Par8">Polyploidization has played a large role in the evolution of all flowering plants and many extant species are recent polyploids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, polyploidization has played a role in the evolution of many fungal, fish and amphibian species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A large fraction of polyploid species are derived from the hybridization of different species and are termed allopolyploids. Understanding the evolution and regulation of polyploid genomes requires the creation of accurate assemblies for each subgenome. The high level of sequence similarity between subgenomes makes this particularly challenging and even state-of-the-art genome assembly algorithms often collapse and/or incorrectly interweave chunks of homeologous chromosomes. Significantly, without high resolution genetic maps or related data these errors remain undetected. These errors are not necessarily resolved by long-read technologies, since such assemblies are still fragmented in many thousands of pieces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Lack of subgenome resolution for allopolyploid genomes is a major obstacle to studying the origin, evolution, and functional properties of allopolyploid genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">For some allopolyploid species, extant diploid species similar to the true progenitors can be used to disentangle the subgenomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, for many allopolyploids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the diploid parents are unknown or extinct. Even when extant progenitor-like species exist, they may differ substantially from the genomes of the individuals that gave rise to the allopolyploid. Thus, unguided methods for identification and extraction of subgenomes within allopolyploids would be extremely useful. Recently a phasing method was developed for the highly heterozygous sweet potato genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, this method is limited to highly polymorphic genomes and is restricted to single-copy sequence present in each subgenome that can be accurately genotyped.</p><p id="Par10">Deliberate integration of synthetic transposons with molecular barcodes is a common experimental approach to label subpopulations of DNA or cells to allow subsequent retrieval from complex mixtures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Nature&#x02019;s equivalents of synthetic molecular barcodes include transposons, viruses, and other classes of repetitive DNA. These elements rapidly proliferate and evolve in natural populations, thus labeling the recent evolutionary history of an organism&#x02019;s genome (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Transposon families may dramatically expand and contract over short periods of evolutionary time, during which they may also significantly change in sequence identity. For example, the size of the <italic>Oryza australiensis</italic> genome doubled in just a few million years due to the amplification of a few long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Removal of LTR retrotransposons by illegitimate recombination can eliminate megabases of sequence over similar timescales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Thus, two recently diverged species may quantitatively differ in the frequency of transposon families they harbor and the sequence identity of those families.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the strategy for determining species/subgenome of origin for sequences based on their profile of repetitive k-mers. The algorithm takes sequences from a sample containing one or more species/subgenome. Each species has both common and divergent repetitive k-mers scattered throughout its genome. Each k-mer is indicated by a different color (for clarity, only divergent k-mers are shown). We construct a graph where sequences are nodes and shared instances of repetitive k-mers are edges. By connecting all instances of a given repetitive k-mer we are able to connect and subsequently group sequences derived from a common species/subgenome</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2019_5828_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par11">In the context of allopolyploids, repeats in the parental species change and proliferate independently after those species diverge creating species-specific genomic signatures. Once reunited within a single cell of an allopolyploid, these repeats are free to proliferate between the subgenomes and these additional copies are specific to the allopolyploid but not the progenitor species. If additional subgenomes are added via subsequent additional hybridizations, then the initial allopolyploid-specific repeat signatures may distinguish initial subgenomes from subgenomes added during later rounds of inter-specific hybridization. Fortuitously, the process of interspecific hybridization may in fact trigger virus and transposon proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Thus, naturally occurring repetitive DNA can be used as molecular barcodes to distinguish genomes and subgenomes.</p><p id="Par12">Here we describe an algorithm that identifies natural molecular barcodes that act as species of origin labels for the DNA sequences in which they reside. Our method creates and partitions a graph in which sequences are connected by edges, corresponding to specific signatures of repetitive DNA inferred from short nucleotide sequences (k-mers). Our method allows accurate separation of the subgenomes of polyploid species without prior knowledge of the genomes or a database of known sequences. We further built a toolkit of functions, implemented as a python package called polyCRACKER (polyploid Cluster Repeats by Ancestral Common K-mer Estimation and Retrieval), for the automatic binning of sequence scaffolds from polyploid genomes. Our method draws its inspiration from other unsupervised algorithms for binning sequences commonly applied to metagenome datasets, but by focusing on repetitive k-mers with faster rates of divergence between two species, rather than all k-mers or a random sampling of k-mers, our method is not confounded by the overall high sequence similarity between homeologous sequences in allopolyploids or sequencing datasets containing genomes from multiple closely related species.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par13">We designed an efficient unsupervised learning algorithm to automatically identify and bin DNA sequences according to subgenome based on the shared presence of short repeated DNA sequences (k-mers) that act as naturally occurring molecular barcodes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The workflow is as follows: a polyploid genome is sequenced and assembled to scaffolds that are unordered with respect to their subgenome. Most scaffolds contain multiple k-mers derived from repetitive DNA elements. A graph is constructed where sequences are nodes and their profile of shared repeat-k-mers are edges. By connecting all instances of a given repetitive k-mer, we are able to connect and subsequently group sequences derived from each subgenome (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). It is notable that while both high and low copy k-mers may be specific to one subgenome versus another, only high copy k-mers provide the multiple edges between multiple different sequence nodes necessary to group sequences together by subgenome of origin.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>polyCRACKER method for unsupervised partitioning of sequence into species bins</title><p id="Par14">Unsupervised partitioning of sequences proceeds in two phases: 1) initial partitioning of sequences into subgenome bins via a nearest neighbors graph of repeat-k-mers and 2) signal amplification from groups identified in the first phase.</p><p id="Par15">

</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Polyploid genome analysis</title><p id="Par23">The creation of polyCRACKER was motivated by prior sequence binning applications, particularly in the unsupervised metagenomics binning field. However, tools designed for unsupervised binning of metagenomes either require input that is not relevant for allopolyploid analysis, such as multiple samples from different microbial environments, or rely too heavily on large overall differences in k-mer frequency that are typically not found between highly similar allopolyploid subgenomes. However, as discussed above, it has been shown that the profile of repetitive k-mers may vary considerably between allopolyploid subgenomes. We therefore investigated whether a method specifically focusing on the tracking of repeat-k-mers in allopolyploid genomes would enable database-free subgenome binning. Initial results on simulated datasets representing mixtures of closely related microbial genomes showed promise, even when these genomes had relatively low levels of repetitive DNA (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). These results encouraged us to turn our attention to the unsupervised separation of subgenomes from the complex allopolyploid genomes of tobacco and wheat.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Subgenome analysis of the allotetraploid plant, <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic></title><p id="Par24"><italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> is thought to have formed less than 200,000&#x02009;years ago by the hybridization of two diploid species similar or identical to <italic>N. sylvestris</italic> (source of the S-subgenome) and <italic>N. tomentosiformis</italic> (source of the T-subgenome). The genome of <italic>N. tabacum</italic> is slightly smaller than the combined sizes of its diploid progenitors due to the preferential loss of repetitive sequence from the T-subgenome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Initial studies comparing the <italic>N. tabacum</italic> genome to the genomes of <italic>N. sylvestris</italic> and <italic>N. tomentosiformis</italic> assigned about 80% of the assembly to the S- or T-subgenomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A recent study used optical and genetic maps to assign 64% of the assembled <italic>N. tabacum</italic> sequence to pseudomolecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A significant complicating factor in the separation of the S- and T-subgenomes is the large number of translocations that have occurred between the S- and T-progenitor chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thus, identifying and separating the ancestral S- and T-subgenomes from the modern allopolyploid requires classification of alternating stretches of contiguous DNA within chromosomes and not simply labeling of whole chromosomes.</p><p id="Par25">We created an initial dataset for testing and verification of polyCRACKER by splitting the sequences within the pseudomolecule-anchored portion of the <italic>N. tabacum</italic> genome into non-overlapping 250&#x02009;kb segments. This later allowed us to visualize subgenome classification with respect to position within pseudomolecules. This was particularly important for <italic>N. tabacum</italic> due to the numerous translocations that have occurred between subgenomes and the uncertainty of whether polyCRACKER could accurately assign progenitor of origin to pseudomolecules containing sequences from different progenitors. We validated the assignment of progenitor of origin by polyCRACKER by using, in this case, the known (and also assembled) progenitors of the allopolyploid, <italic>N. sylvestris</italic> and <italic>N. tomentosiformis</italic>. We quantified agreement between polyCRACKER subgenome assignments and the subgenome assignments determined by comparison to the progenitor genome sequences. Relationships between <italic>N. tabacum</italic> sequences are depicted in principal component analysis (PCA) plots (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a,b) and a spectrally embedded graph (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). Each data point in the PCA plot corresponds to a 250&#x02009;kb segment and the proximity of the points indicates the degree of shared repetitive k-mers. Points were colored by their inferred progenitor of origin via polyCRACKER (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) or by comparison to the diploid progenitor genomes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Segments were linked to their 20 nearest neighbors to create a network graph. The energy minimization of a non-repulsive force-directed graph of the 20 nearest neighbors yields spectrally embedded data (spectral embedding/laplacian eigenmaps); polyCRACKER groups sequences by clustering the spectral embedding of the dimensionality reduced data. This is depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, in which nodes (sequences) are colored according to their species of origin assignment based on comparison to the diploid progenitor genomes.

Increasing k-mer length (specificity) can decrease sensitivity by decreasing the frequency of repeat-k-mers spread across the genome sequences, but this can in part be compensated for reducing threshold for defining a k-mer as repetitive (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

We analyzed test datasets comprised of multiple closely related species and real polyploid genomes to demonstrate the ability of polyCRACKER to separate genomes ranging from small fungal genomes with little repetitive DNA (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1) to enormous repeat-rich polyploid plant genomes (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). By enabling subgenome-specific analysis polyCRACKER can accelerate rapid advancements in our understanding of polyploid genome evolution and regulation. In particular, it will enable functional studies of genes according to subgenome, promote a deeper understanding of genome dominance and enable comparative studies of diverse polyploids to discern any rules governing polyploid genome evolution.</p><p id="Par34">PolyCRACKER will be particularly useful for the latter by allowing analysis of polyploid species that do not have advanced genetic resources like genetic maps. It should be noted that our overall primary goal for developing polyCRACKER is beyond simply assigning sequences to their subgenome within the modern allopolyploid. Assignment of sequences to their location within the modern allopolyploid can be accomplished by ever improving technologies including optical maps, genetic maps, Hi-C data, and various long-read sequencing technologies. Rather, the goal of polyCRACKER is to assign sequences to their ancestral progenitor subgenome and clarify what sequences were donated by which ancestral progenitor (even a possibly extinct progenitor). PolyCRACKER is not limited to the analysis of only genomes with long-range contiguity or scaffolding, as demonstrated by our use of fragmented draft genome assemblies. However, if the analyzed genome does have sufficient long-range information, additional insight can be gleaned in the form of identification of translocations between the original progenitor genomes. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, modern chromosomes of tobacco are a mosaic of the original progenitor genomes. While this is known for tobacco, due to the availability and prior identification of its progenitor species, for many allopolyploid species the progenitors of origin are unknown or extinct. Therefore, polyCRACKER may be particularly useful when applied to genomes with long-range information. In allopolyploid genomes with long-range scaffolding, polyCRACKER can uncover the frequency and nature of chromosomal translocations between ancestral progenitor genomes. Nonetheless, biological translocations within the evolutionary history of a species is not the only means by which chromosomal mosaics of ancestral progenitors is observed. Indeed, errors in genome assembly of allopolyploids in which a subsequence of one homeologous chromosome is inserted in place of the true sequence often produces the same observation. This occurs frequently in allopolyploid genome assemblies as many sequences within homeologous chromosomes are virtually identical (with the exception of transposons, viral DNA and other repetitive sequences). Thus polyCRACKER may be useful check for evaluating assembly accuracy and identifying potential mis-assemblies in allopolyploid genomes.</p><p id="Par35">Repetitive DNA is a major component of eukaryotic genomes. While polyCRACKER exploits the rapid turnover and evolution of repetitive elements to separate closely related genomes, it can also be used as tool to study the origin, evolution, and impact of repetitive DNA on the entire genome. We used the differential k-mers identified by polyCRACKER to assign assembled repeats to subgenomes. This also placed the k-mers into the context of intact repetitive elements. We also demonstrated that subgenome-specific repetitive elements could be used to bin subsequences by subgenomes.</p><p id="Par36">Existing unsupervised methods used to separate subgenomes were developed to bin genomes from metagenome samples and are ill-suited for classifying allopolyploids because the homeologous chromosomes often have more similar overall k-mer profiles than the profiles of chromosomes within their respective subgenomes. In contrast to previous algorithms and approaches for grouping sequences by species of origin, we focus on the fact that even closely related species often differ in the frequency of repeat sequences present throughout their genome. This is particularly useful for polyploid subgenomes because such subgenomes are usually so closely related that they do not differ in coarse genome features like tetranucleotide frequency, GC content, or codon usage. The k-mers used by polyCRACKER may correspond to sequences associated with transposons, viruses, and other parasitic sequences that have proliferated in one species relative to another. PolyCRACKER groups scaffolds into bins that correspond to distinct species by: 1) counting the number of instances of short and/or long repeat k-mer sequences, 2) creating a sparse matrix of number of instances of k-mers by the subsequences on which they occur, 3) reducing the dimensionality of the sparse matrix by one of several known (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) applying a clustering method (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). PolyCRACKER can then further increase signal by taking the resulting binned sequences and 1) counting k-mer frequency, 2) identifying k-mers that are enriched in one bin versus other bins, and 3) use the presence of enriched k-mers on previously ambiguous sequences to group them into the appropriate species bin.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques used in polyCRACKER for this study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Species</th><th>Dimensionality reduction technique</th><th>Clustering technique</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><italic>N. tabacum</italic> (including unanchored sequences)</td><td>KPCA with cosine kernel</td><td>Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models</td></tr><tr><td><italic>N. tabacum</italic> (only anchored sequences)</td><td>KPCA with cosine kernel</td><td>Spectral Clustering</td></tr><tr><td>

Indeed, both polyCRACKER and database-dependent classification of <italic>N. tabacum</italic> confirm that the S-subgenome is substantially larger than the T-subgenome as suggested by others previously, and consistent with biased repetitive sequence loss from the T subgenome. We also identify several classes of repeats that are enriched in each subgenome.

In conclusion, polyCRACKER is a robust method for classifying sequences according to species of origin that will be important in future studies of allopolyploids.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par38">We describe a method to group sequences belonging to the same subgenome that consists of connecting sequences within a graph in which edges are shared profiles of repetitive k-mers. The network graph is established by considering a user-supplied number of regions with closest repeat distributions (number of nearest neighbors). The distance between sequence nodes in the graph is indicative of the level of shared k-mers. Thus, polyCRACKER groups sequences by species of origin by connecting nodes, representing sequences, by edges that represent the common occurrence of repetitive DNA sequences unique to that species or subgenome. This technique was applied to highly fragmented draft genome assemblies or simulated assemblies. Scaffold lengths were normalized by splitting larger sequences into shorter subsequences. PolyCRACKER identifies potentially informative k-mers that occur above a minimum frequency. This greatly reduces the number of k-mers that are subsequently mapped to the scaffolds to determine their per scaffold frequency.</p><p id="Par39">PolyCRACKER creates a sparse matrix, in which rows correspond to fragments and columns are unique k-mers, and each intersection contains the frequency of each unique k-mer on each scaffold subsequence. Then, it performs dimensionality reduction on the sparse matrix, projecting the high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space, where each subsequence is represented by a point in the lower dimensional space. At this point we can visualize the data in three-dimensional graphical plots (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In order to assign sequences to species or subgenomes, polyCRACKER performs unsupervised clustering on the low-dimensional data via clustering. Any ambiguous sequences are removed, but may be used later through a signal amplification method described below.</p><p id="Par40">To assign additional subsequences to species bins, polyCRACKER identifies highly differential k-mers between the initially grouped scaffolds and uses these k-mers to recruit the remaining, ambiguous subsequences. Similar to above, we identify unique k-mers for each preliminary group of scaffolds, and then identify k-mers that differentiate those already grouped sequences by comparing the number of occurrences of a particular k-mer in one group versus the others. K-mers that occur frequently in one group, but not in at least one of the others, past a certain threshold, are output to a FASTA file as differential k-mers for that group. PolyCRACKER maps each set of the differential k-mers against the entire set of scaffolds in the assembly. We then find the total counts for the sum of all differential k-mers of a particular group for each subsequence. The results of the aforementioned step may be plotted across entire chromosomes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) as a cross-check for the test case, which was done using shinyCircos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] (polyCRACKER formats the input data for shinyCircos). When the total counts of an inferred subgenome&#x02019;s differential k-mers in a region are substantially larger than that of the differential k-mers of another inferred subgenome in that region, polyCRACKER extracts the binned sequences and stores them in FASTA format. The now larger set of grouped subsequences can be used as the new input for another round of differential k-mer analysis to recruit more subsequences. The previous steps (recruiting differential k-mers and binning sequences) are repeated until the number of iterations reaches a user-defined cutoff, and the user can select the species bins from any iteration of the binning process. The final results and spectral graph can be visualized in several ways, including force-directed physics simulations of the <italic>K-nearest-neighbors</italic> graph to visualize changes in the data&#x02019;s structure over time. An analogous approach can be taken for binning sequences by repeat elements, although the k-mer analysis results must be used as an input for that algorithm to identify the initial differential repeat elements.</p><p id="Par41">Below is a high level overview the methodology:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par42">Break the assembly into fragments of a fixed size, keeping track of the scaffolds from which these fragments came from.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par43">Bin the fragments by subgenome.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par44">Optionally, merge the binned fragments back together based on their scaffold of origin (or bin the entire original scaffold based on the total counts of differential repetitive sequence).

Of vital importance is making sure that there is not too little repetitive content and not too much. If there is not enough repeat content included in the genome fragments, then they will be hard to bin. The function <italic>number_repeatmers_per_subsequence</italic> plots a histogram of the number of repeat-mers present in each chunked genome fragment. If this histogram is skewed to lower k-mer counts in each fragment, then reducing the k-mer size, increasing the length of the fragments, decreasing the minimum genome-wide k-mer frequency for k-mer inclusion, amongst other changes can help increase the repetitive content of each fragment, thereby improving the initial binning of these fragments into subgenomes. There exists help documentation in the polyCRACKER source code repository that can help inform about sensible binning practices. Too much repetitive content can be problematic because analyzing the excessive number of repetitive k-mers is computationally demanding, and reductions in the k-mer size could lead to the inclusion of k-mers that are not unique to a particular subgenome. This can be dealt with by subsampling as described below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Propagating PolyCRACKER labels via the relative position of fragments</title><p id="Par46">Since polyCRACKER performs best when the length of the input sequences are similar, we split scaffolds into fragments of similar length as we did when we prepared the <italic>N. tabacum</italic> input dataset. However, it is still possible to use prior information about the location of the fragments in scaffolds. For example, if one or several fragments belonging to a scaffold are classified to a subgenome, it is likely that other subsequences from the same scaffold are also associated with that same subgenome. PolyCRACKER uses this information by passing subgenome labels of classified subsequences through a semi-supervised label propagation algorithm that takes into account labels as well as relative genomic positions from which subsequences are derived to infer the labels of the unclassified subsequences. Conversely, when interrogating unvalidated assemblies, discordance between scaffold labels and species assignment may indicate assembly errors that can be fixed by breaking scaffolds.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Random sampling of repeat k-mers for datasets too large to include all k-mers</title><p id="Par47">PolyCRACKER can randomly subsample repeat k-mers when the data set is too large to include all k-mers with available computational resources.

PolyCRACKER also employs multiple algorithms to discover repeat element subclasses that are important and informative for differentiating the subgenomes, as discussed in the Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Distinguishing species of origin using de novo repeat annotations</title><p id="Par52">PolyCRACKER grouped <italic>N. tabacum</italic>&#x02019;s pseudomolecule-anchored assembly (broken into 250&#x02009;kb fragments) by species of origin using de novo repeat annotations in a similar method as used for k-mers. A matrix of scaffolds vs repeats was constructed. Differential repeats were identified as defined by a five-fold greater presence in one subgenome versus the other. Subgenome labels found via polyCRACKER&#x02019;s k-mer based binning were then used to identify highly informative repeats (features with high chi-squared value). Intersection of differential repeats with the 150 most informative repeats from each subgenome yielded 300 informative differential repeats. PolyCRACKER then performed feature selection on the matrix, keeping columns/repeats corresponding to highly informative repeats. PolyCRACKER performed principal component analysis and clustered the feature selected matrix to find new labels of scaffolds and to see if repeats can distinguish subgenomes. In this clustering process, nodes, representing scaffolds, were linked by edges that connected two nodes with similar consensus repeat coverage/content, and Spectral Clustering was used to perform normalized cuts of this graph to form initial partitions. Using the same process as outlined for k-mers, differential repeats were identified between the initial sequence bins by being eight or greater times present in one genome versus the other, and then they were used to recruit more subsequences via the signal amplification process, finding the total hits of these differential repeats in each bin. PolyCRACKER reassigned subgenome labels if their ratio of hits of the total differential repeat counts is greater than a threshold, in this case 3 times greater. The process of identifying differential repeats and then re-binning by the ratio of total repeat counts for each scaffold is reiterated via a bootstrap process until convergence, in which after a number of trials, the amount of sequence assigned to each bin does not appear to make large changes, converges on a set amount of sequence, and the number of times this process can be run is left to the user&#x02019;s discretion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Identification of informative repeat classes</title><p id="Par53">Consensus repeats, identified during de novo repeat finding and labelled by unique identifiers were identified by polyCRACKER as differential if the number of identified instances of that consensus repeat were five or more times more frequent in one subgenome versus the other. Out of all differential repeats identified, polyCRACKER selected 400 (200 from each subgenome) of these repeats (from the unanchored <italic>N. tabacum</italic> scaffolds) as subgenome signatures. The repeats were grouped together by their subclass annotation. Specific subclasses of repeats were found by polyCRACKER to be highly informative if their number of informative differential consensus repeats was statistically significantly under or over represented versus a similar distribution of the consensus repeats across the entire genome (via a chi-squared statistic).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>
