Recent studies have shown that the error patterns of NHEJ are strongly biased by sequence context, but these studies were based on relatively few templates. To investigate this more thoroughly, we systematically profiled &#x0223c;1.16 million independent mutational events resulting from CRISPR/Cas9-mediated cleavage and NHEJ-mediated DSB repair of 6872 synthetic target sequences, introduced into a human cell line via lentiviral infection. We find that: (i) insertions are dominated by 1 bp events templated by sequence immediately upstream of the cleavage site, (ii) deletions are predominantly associated with microhomology and (iii) targets exhibit variable but reproducible diversity with respect to the number and relative frequency of the mutational outcomes to which they give rise. From these data, we trained a model that uses local sequence context to predict the distribution of mutational outcomes. Exploiting the bias of NHEJ outcomes towards microhomology mediated events, we demonstrate the programming of deletion patterns by introducing microhomology to specific locations in the vicinity of the DSB site. We anticipate that our results will inform investigations of DSB repair mechanisms as well as the design of CRISPR/Cas9 experiments for diverse applications including genome-wide screens, gene therapy, lineage tracing and molecular recording.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Paul G.

In mammalian cells, such DSBs are primarily repaired by one of two pathways&#x02014;homology directed repair (HDR) and classical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). HDR uses homologous template sequences to repair the DSB, potentially introducing programmed edits via the repair template. In contrast, c-NHEJ directly rejoins the broken ends, often perfectly but occasionally introducing errors, typically in the form of short insertions or deletions (indels) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In addition to HDR and cNHEJ, there is evidence for an alternative NHEJ pathway (alt-NHEJ), also termed microhomology mediated end joining (MMEJ), wherein short, homologous sequences in the vicinity of the DSB are used to align the broken ends prior to joining, resulting in deletions or potentially more complex events (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Below, we use &#x02018;NHEJ&#x02019; to refer to both c-NHEJ and MMEJ/alt-NHEJ, i.e. template-free editing.</p><p>In recent years, CRISPR/Cas9 has emerged as a particularly versatile tool for genome editing. For many if not most applications of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering, it is used in conjunction with the cell's endogenous NHEJ machinery to introduce short indels in a targeted fashion (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref>), e.g. to disrupt the function of genes or regulatory elements (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref>) or to introduce irreversible changes that record cell lineage or molecular events (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref>). However, despite NHEJ&#x02019;s central role in this transformative tool, our understanding of the processes that determine the rate and patterns of NHEJ-mediated errors remains incomplete.</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that the error outcomes of NHEJ are strongly dependent on sequence context (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Other studies show that the characteristics of the broken ends (blunt or staggered end; length of any overhang) also affect end-joining patterns both <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, a systematic profiling of the sequence determinants of NHEJ repair patterns has yet to be undertaken.</p><p>Here, we profiled &#x0223c;1.16 million mutational events resulting from <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> Cas9 (<italic>Sp</italic>Cas9)-mediated cleavage and NHEJ-mediated DSB repair of 6872 synthetic target sequences. From the resulting data, we identify the primary features of sequences adjacent to the sites of DSBs that shape the distribution and relative frequency of NHEJ-mediated mutational outcomes, e.g. nucleotide content and microhomology. We furthermore exploit microhomology to demonstrate the &#x02018;programming&#x02019; of deletion patterns. Finally, we develop a <underline>l</underline>ogistic regression model to predict <underline>in</underline>sertions and <underline>del</underline>etions (<bold>Lindel</bold>) that result from CRISPR/Cas9-mediated cleavage of an arbitrary sequence.

For each reaction we used 250&#x000a0;ng of genomic DNA, 0.2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l 100&#x000a0;mM primer and 25 &#x003bc;l HiFi HotStart ReadyMix 2&#x000d7; (KAPA Biosystems). PCR reaction were performed as follows: 95&#x000b0;C 3 min, 98&#x000b0;C 20 s, 5 cycles of 65&#x000b0;C 1 min and 72&#x000b0;C 2 min, 98&#x000b0;C 20 s, 5 cycles of 65&#x000b0;C 1 min and 72&#x000b0;C 2 min. The subsequent PCR product was cleaned with 1.8&#x000d7; AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) and resuspended in 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of elution buffer. A second round of amplification was performed using primers targeting the 5&#x02032; sequencing adaptor (P8) and 50 bp downstream of the cleavage site (P9) for 20 cycles. The resulting PCR product was then size selected using a dual size-selection cleanup of 0.4&#x000d7; and 0.8&#x000d7; AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) to remove genomic DNA and small fragments (&#x0003c;200 bp) respectively. This size-selected product was subsequently re-amplified to add the 3&#x02032; sequencing adaptor with primer P8 and P10 for an additional five cycles. The final PCR product was cleaned with 0.75x AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) and was re-amplified to add flow-cell adaptor and sample index for 5 cycles. All PCR reactions used HiFi HotStart ReadyMix 2&#x000d7; (KAPA Biosystems) with the manufacturer's recommended conditions. The library was sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencer using paired-end 150&#x000a0;cycle reads.

We first clustered these paired-end reads by their 15 bp UMI sequence and then filtered out reads with &#x0003c;90% identity within their representative UMI clusters. Sequence identity was identified using edlib (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). UMIs with fewer than 10 reads were excluded from downstream analysis. This yielded 4 405 379 UMIs (91 325 700 reads), representing &#x0223c;61.8% of our sequencing data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). We then selected the most common forward and reverse read sequence for each UMI for further processing. These forward and reverse reads were merged into a single read using PEAR (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) and aligned in a two step process as follows. First, we sought to identify the &#x02018;reference&#x02019; sequences for each programmed array sequence. We aligned the merged reads to a backbone sequence where the guides and targets were represented by Ns using EMBO&#x02019;s needleall software (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) with the following scoring matrix: match = 5, mismatch = -4, gap-open = &#x02013;20, gap-extension = &#x02013;0.5. The mismatch penalty for <italic>N</italic>s was set to 0. The sequence over the guide region was then extracted and matched against the list of programmed array sequences. Guide sequences with more than two mismatches to the designed guides were excluded, with edit distances assessed with UMI-tools (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Second, merged reads were aligned to their discovered reference, in which <italic>N</italic>s were replaced by the guide/target sequence identified from the first step, using Biopython.pairwise2 (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) with the following scoring matrix: match = 5, mismatch = &#x02013;4, gap-open = &#x02013;13, gap-extension = &#x02013;0.5. All indels were then right aligned (e.g. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>). Aligned reads with indels within &#x02013;3/+2 bp of the cleavage site were assigned to their indel class. Aligned reads were excluded for downstream analysis if the sgRNA and target sequence didn&#x02019;t match, the result from template switch during lentivirus transduction (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), or unexpected mutations introduced during synthesis, cloning, and PCR. A final library of 1.19 million unique reads (UMIs) were identified.

Because large mutation events are rare, we limited our classification effort to deletion events &#x0003c;30 bp, and we grouped insertions &#x02265;3 bp into one class. In total, we defined 557 classes of indels. These classes include 536 deletion alleles, 4 possible single nucleotide insertion, and 16 possible dinucleotide insertion and insertions &#x02265;3 bp. There are a total of 550 potential deletion events that are both &#x0003c;30 bp in length and overlap with the &#x02013;3/+2 window around the cleavage site. We captured 536 deletion alleles in our data; the missing 14 classes are mainly large deletions. As input to our model, we defined 3033 binary features. These are (i) Sequence features: 384 binary features corresponding to the one-hot encoded target sequence (excluding the PAM region), including 80 for single nucleotide content (4 nucleotides &#x000d7; 20 positions) and 304 for dinucleotide content (16 dinucleotides &#x000d7; 19 positions); (ii) Microhomology features: 2649 binary features corresponding to MH tracts; specifically, for each of the possible deletion event class, we defined five binary features (or 2&#x02013;4, depending on the size of deletion) corresponding to the length of the MH tract, if any (0-4 bp &#x000d7; 519 + 0&#x02013;3 bp &#x000d7; 7 + 0&#x02013;2 bp &#x000d7; 6 + 0&#x02013;1 bp &#x000d7;&#x000a0;4 deletion event classes = total 2649 binary features. Our 4790 programmed sequences were randomly partitioned into a training set of 3,900 sequences, a validation set of 450 sequences, and a test set of 440 sequences.</p><p>We trained the logistic regression in a standard manner for machine learning models. However, because each target sequence can generate many possible repair outcomes, we trained our models using soft labels that correspond to the probability that each class is observed, rather than hard labels that force each input to correspond exclusively to one class. Each model was trained using the Adam optimizer (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) with a learning rate of 0.001 and a categorical cross-entropy loss. Training proceeded for a maximum of 100 epochs with a &#x02018;patience&#x02019; of 1, meaning that training was stopped after two epochs with no improvement in validation set performance.

In brief, we designed 70 000 targets balanced in nucleotide content and screened against the human genome for CRISPR/Cas9 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). We then used array-based oligonucleotide synthesis to encode these targets in <italic>cis</italic> with their corresponding sgRNAs, separated by a 20 bp spacer. We then amplified and cloned these molecules to a lentiviral vector. In our initial experiments, the complexity of the resulting library of synthetic targets and their cognate sgRNAs was such that we obtained relatively few edited templates per target. Therefore, we re-cloned the library under bottlenecking conditions (Materials and Methods), reducing its complexity to 12 917 targets. We then proceeded with viral packaging and transduction, in triplicate, of a monoclonal human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cell line that stably expresses <italic>sp</italic>Cas9 (multiplicity of infection of &#x0223c;4&#x02013;8). As such, within any given cell, only one or a few sgRNAs are expressed, and each one directs Cas9-mediated DSBs to a target located immediately adjacent to it. After five days to allow for the introduction of NHEJ-mediated errors at these targets, cells were harvested and genomic DNA isolated. We then PCR amplified the region comprising the targets and corresponding sgRNAs using unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) appended during the first extension cycle to distinguish whether identical edits were derived from the same cell or different cells.</p><p>Summing across the three replicates, we sequenced PCR amplicons to a depth of &#x0223c;148 million reads, which were reduced to &#x0223c;1.19 million reads after collapsing on the basis of identical sequences and UMIs, and filtering of reads with evidence of lentivirus-mediated template switching (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) or other unexpected sequences (e.g. synthesis or PCR errors).

These are (i) Sequence features: 384 binary features corresponding to one-hot encoded sequence, including 80 for single nucleotide content (4 nucleotides &#x000d7; 20 positions) and 304 for dinucleotide content (16 dinucleotides &#x000d7; 19 positions); (ii) microhomology features: 2649 binary features corresponding to MH tracts; specifically, for each of the possible deletion event class, we defined 2&#x02013;5 binary features (depending on the size of deletion) corresponding to the length of the MH tract ([0&#x02013;4 bp &#x000d7; 519] + [0&#x02013;3 bp &#x000d7; 7] + [0&#x02013;2 bp &#x000d7; 6] + [0&#x02013;1 bp &#x000d7; 4] deletion event classes = total of 2649 binary features) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).</p><fig id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>End joining patterns are accurately predicted by Lindel.

A total of 3033 binary features&#x02014;2649 corresponding to MH potential and 384 to one-hot encoded mono- and di-nucleotide content of the 20 bp target&#x02014;are extracted. One-hot encoded sequence features were used to the predict overall ratio of insertion to deletion events. One-hot encoded sequence corresponding to the last 6 bp of the target sequence were used to predict 21 insertion classes. Both sequence features and microhomology features were used to predict deletion classes. Probabilities of redundant deletion classes were combined on a sequence specific manner.

Poorly predicted targets largely correspond to those that were poorly sampled (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5B</xref>). As a baseline to illustrate the improvement conferred by Lindel, we show a similar distribution for the aggregate model, in which the predicted frequencies of 557 indel classes are simply taken from the aggregate frequency at which each is observed in the training and validation datasets (red). (<bold>C, D</bold>) The performance of Lindel trained using training data aggregated from this study and the ForeCasT study (3900 sequences from this study and 10 725 from (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>)).

The overall distribution of predicted outcomes is then determined by intersecting these three components. Of note, because we define deletion classes using the deletion start site and deletion length, two or more classes can effectively represent identical outcomes due to microhomology, but in a sequence specific manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5C</xref>). To address this, while evaluating performance, we simply collapsed identical outcomes.</p><p>We trained predictors for each of the three components independently using logistic regression with a varied number of features and varied strength of L1 or L2 penalties. All of the models were trained on the training set using cross-entropy loss and evaluated on the validation set using the mean squared error (MSE). For the indel ratio predictor, we predicted that microhomology features and sequence context would both be important for prediction. However, including microhomology features did not improve the performance compared to using one-hot encoded sequence alone (MSE = 0.0203 and 0.0201 respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5D</xref>). For the insertion predictor, it has been shown above that most insertions were templated by the sequence upstream of the cleavage site. We reasoned that sequence context around the cleavage site (&#x000b1;3 bp) should be sufficient to predict insertions. Consistent with this, including the full 20 bp target worsened performance, increasing MSE from 0.00666 to 0.00711 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5E</xref>). For the deletion predictor, we compared the performance of models using sequence features only, microhomology features only or all features. The model with all-features performed the best (MSE of 0.000204, as compared with 0.000271 for sequence-only and 0.000208 for microhomology-only) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5F</xref>). However, the nearly identical performance of the all-features versus microhomology-only models for predicting deletions is notable. We used the best performing model for each component to build a predictor for the overall distribution of outcomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).</p><p>Applying this model to the test set of 440 target sequences, which had been entirely held out from the training and validation steps, we compared the observed versus predicted frequencies of indels falling into various &#x02018;event classes&#x02019;. Observations and predictions were well matched for most targets, with a MSE of 0.000172 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). As a baseline, we also generated a set of predictions based simply on the aggregate frequencies of event classes in the training and validation datasets; as expected, these predictions performed more poorly (MSE of 0.000359; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), confirming the improvement conferred by the model. Poorly predicted targets tended to be those with relatively shallower sampling of editing events, <italic>i.e</italic>. where our observed frequencies are noisier (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-7"><title>Comparison to other models</title><p>While this manuscript was in preparation, several similar studies were published (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;33</xref>). Together with this manuscript, all four studies profiled repair outcomes of Cas9-induced DSBs at large numbers of endogenous (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) or synthetic (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The primary conclusions, <italic>e.g</italic>. that sequence context around the DSB, together with MH, are the major determinants of repair outcomes, are consistent between these studies as well as with earlier studies (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In addition, Shen <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> built inDelphi and Allen <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> built ForeCasT, as models that predict NHEJ repair outcomes, analogous to the Lindel model described here. The ForeCasT model predicts deletions similarly to Lindel, as well as all possible 1&#x02013;2 bp insertions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). In contrast, the inDelphi model predicts the frequency of three classes of indels independently, using a neural network model for MH-mediated deletions (90 classes) and non-MH deletions (59 classes corresponding to 1&#x02013;59 bp deletions, without prediction of location), and <italic>k</italic>-nearest neighbors model for 1 bp insertions (four classes) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p><p>We compared the three models by measuring the MSE on 440 targets in our test set as well as 4298 targets in ForeCasT test set (of note, the predicted probabilities of event classes not predicted by inDelphi were simply set to 0). Our model performed the best on our test set (MSE = 0.000172, 0.000225, 0.000212 for Lindel, ForeCasT and inDelphi, respectively), while ForeCasT performed the best on its test set (MSE = 0.000173, 0.000152, 0.000182, for Lindel, ForeCasT and inDelphi, respectively). We then combined our training set (3900 sequences) with ForeCast training set (10 725 sequences), resulting in a total of 14&#x000a0;625 sequences. We trained on this aggregated training set using the Lindel modeling approach, which resulted in the best overall performance (MSE = 0.000165 on our test set and 0.000125 on ForeCasT test set; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>,&#x000a0;D). This final Lindel model is more accurate at predicting the ratio of insertions to deletions than ForeCasT (MSE = 0.01 and 0.02 for final Lindel model and ForeCasT, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6A,B</xref>). We further investigated the source of the errors for these models. Despite the fact that they implement different modeling approaches, both Lindel and ForeCasT&#x02019;s mispredictions primarily lie with small deletions and 1 bp insertions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6C&#x02013;F</xref>).</p><p>As a common use of CRISPR/Cas9 in conjunction with NHEJ is to introduce frameshifting mutations, we also assessed the observed versus predicted ratios of frameshifting indels for each of the 440 targets in our test set and 4298 targets in ForeCasT test set, and found them to be reasonably correlated (Pearson's <italic>r</italic> = 0.707, MSE = 0.0122 on our test set and Pearson's <italic>r</italic> = 0.676, MSE = 0.0098 on ForeCasT test set; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6G</xref>). This result compares very favorably with the predictions of a previously published tool that we tested on this same task (Pearson's <italic>r</italic> = 0.283, MSE = 0.0431 on our test set and Pearson's <italic>r</italic> = 0.455, MSE = 0.0315 on the ForeCasT test set; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6H</xref>) (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="SEC4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In summary, we developed an assay to systematically profile the diversity and relative frequencies of mutational events resulting from CRISPR/Cas9-mediated cleavage and NHEJ-mediated DSB repair of thousands of synthetic sequences. In applying this assay and analyzing the editing outcomes associated with 6,872 target sequences, we confirm that CRISPR/NHEJ-mediated repair outcomes for any given target sequence are reproducible, predictable, and largely shaped by the sequence context around the cleavage site (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Our results also provide further insights into NHEJ-mediated repair of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DSBs in human cell lines. <underline>First</underline>, we observe that insertion events are dominated by 1&#x02013;2 bp insertions templated by the sequence immediately upstream of the cleavage site. Together with <italic>in vitro</italic> data from the literature (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), the data supports a model in which the sequence context around the DSB biases the extent to which cleavages are blunt-ended vs. include a 1&#x02013;2 bp 5&#x02032; overhang. Such 5&#x02032; overhangs are repaired by gap-filling and ligation, resulting in asymmetrically templated 1&#x02013;2 bp insertions. <underline>Second</underline>, we observe extensive usage of 1&#x02013;4 bp microhomology in mediating deletion events, and furthermore show that repair outcomes can be strongly biased towards predictable outcomes by intentionally introducing MH tracts at specific distances from the DSB. Notably, however, the introduction of MH tracts did not substantially increase the proportion of MH-mediated events. <underline>Third</underline>, both MH and non-MH-mediated deletions were overwhelmingly unidirectional (i.e. extending either upstream or downstream from the DSB, rather than spanning it).</p><p>Our assay has two main limitations. First, because of the locations of the PCR primer sites, we are only able to recover small deletions, and may be missing the rare, large deletion events that we and others have described (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Greater knowledge of the frequency and determinants of large events is necessary to enable their prediction. Second, the lentiviral-based assay that we used fails to capture the influence of chromatin state on editing efficiency and repair outcomes. Lentivirus integrates to diverse locations across the genome, such that we are effectively observing an average, but integrations are biased towards open chromatin (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). As such, the patterns that we observe and model may be biased to this compartment. Furthermore, we are varying the sgRNA spacer sequence within the context of constant neighboring sequence, i.e. the lentiviral backbone. To the extent that this sequence biases nucleosome positioning, and that nucleosome positioning in turn influences Cas9 binding and cleavage (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), the patterns that we observe and model may be additionally biased. Additional systematic profiling of repair outcomes, in different compartments (e.g. open versus closed chromatin) and in different sequence contexts, will be necessary to understand the magnitude and nature of each of these potential sources of chromatin-mediated bias (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>)</p><p>In addition to insights into into NHEJ-mediated repair of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DSBs, our study also provides a new tool for sgRNA design for diverse goals. First, an important application of CRISPR/Cas9 is to achieve gene knockouts, a goal that depends on the efficient introduction of frameshifting indels. Dual cleavage with a variety of different nuclease systems has previously been shown to be an effective strategy for introducing frameshifting mutations (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40&#x02013;44</xref>). Our model's accuracy for predicting which sgRNAs/targets are likely to result in a high proportion of frameshifting indels will improve the viability of single cleavage with CRISPR/Cas9 for this same goal. Of note, our approach will not obviate the need for downstream validation to identify clones bearing the intended mutation, although it may reduce the number of clones that need to be screened. Second, for applications focused on mutation correction (e.g. using CRISPR/NHEJ to correct pathogenic mutations), the model may be useful for identifying sgRNAs/targets for which the desired outcome is predicted to occur at a high or sufficient frequency. Third, we and others have recently repurposed CRISPR/Cas9 as a tool for lineage tracing and/or molecular recording (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref>). For some goals (e.g. lineage tracing), the identification of &#x02018;high entropy&#x02019; targets may critically enable the diversity necessary to uniquely label millions or billions of cells. For other goals (e.g. molecular recording), the design of &#x02018;low entropy&#x02019; targets may facilitate predictable sequential editing. More generally, a deeper understanding of CRISPR/NHEJ-mediated mutations will strengthen our ability to precisely orchestrate not only the locations but also the outcomes of genome editing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="SEC5"><title>DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>Scripts and other software are available from our GitHub repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/shendurelab/Lindel">https://github.com/shendurelab/Lindel</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>gkz487_Supplemental_File</label><media xlink:href="gkz487_supplemental_file.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ACK1"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank members of the Shendure lab and Dezhong Deng for helpful comments and discussion.</p><p>
