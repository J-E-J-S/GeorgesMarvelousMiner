The human microbiota mainly resides on the skin, on the oral mucosa, and in the gastrointestinal tracts, and has fundamental roles in health and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The development of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has allowed for the study of these communities with an unprecedented depth and resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The gut microbiome has been investigated extensively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], with the skin microbiome becoming another focus of research more recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The skin is colonized by a large number of diverse microorganisms, of which most are beneficial or harmless [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. More specifically, microbes colonize the stratum corneum of the epidermis and skin appendages such as sweat glands and hair follicles. The composition of abundant species is relatively stable over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, skin-associated diseases such as acne vulgaris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], eczema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], or dandruff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] are associated with strong and specific microbiome alterations. For instance, the appearance of acne vulgaris has been linked to dysbiosis in the skin microbiome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This distortion is probably caused by a specific subset of the skin bacterium <italic>Cutibacterium acnes</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Different strains of this bacterium have different degrees of association with acne. For instance, the presence of strains carrying locus 2, a 20&#x02009;kb genomic island, is highly associated with the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]<italic>.</italic> Conversely, different <italic>C. acnes</italic> strains have been associated with multiple positive properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The targeted manipulation of the human microbiome may become a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment and study of diseases. The most prominent example of this therapeutic principle is the treatment of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> within the gut microbiome with the help of fecal transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Following this successful treatment, a number of projects are developing microbiome-based treatments for gut diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Similarly, manipulation of the skin microbiome entails the promise of novel therapeutic approaches for skin diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">We are particularly interested in <italic>C. acnes</italic> and its strain diversity, as this bacterium represents a major part of the human skin microbiome, and certain strains are associated with acne vulgaris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Therefore, we developed and tested an approach to modulate the subpopulation of this species at the strain level.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par7">In this work, we aimed to demonstrate that the human skin microbiome composition can be modulated through approaches similar to those used in fecal transplantation of the gut microbiome. For this, we prepared probiotic solutions from donor microbiomes and applied them onto healthy volunteers, whose skin microbiome was monitored during and after the treatment. Two of these solutions comprise complete microbiome isolations from two donors (CM samples: CM1 and CM2; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1), and three others are composed of defined sets of <italic>C. acnes</italic> strains isolated from donors (PA solutions: H1, H1+A1, and H1+D1+A1; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). The label &#x0201c;PA&#x0201d; stems from <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic>, the original name of the species before it was reclassified as <italic>Cutibacterium acnes</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">These solutions were applied on 18 healthy subjects with ages ranging from 22 to 42. Eight different skin areas were defined for application, whereof three were on the chest and five were located along the spine (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). These areas were chosen due to their typically high abundance of sebaceous glands. To get an understanding about the dose response of applied bacterial strains, three different concentrations were chosen (10<sup>4</sup>, 10<sup>6</sup>, and 10<sup>8</sup>&#x02009;CFU/mL) and applied on the different areas. One area (area 4) was used as a negative control (i.e., no application). To better understand synergistic effects, different strain combinations were used. One mixture contained only strain H1 (H1), a second was spiked with small amounts of A1 (H1+A1), and a third consisting of nearly equal amounts of H1 and D1 and small amounts of A1 (H1+D1+A1). H1 is a type IB strain; A1 and D1 are type IA strains (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2). To circumvent biases on each subject area, a different concentration was applied and rotated along the different individuals. We rotated site application for a given solution to prevent potential specific site biases. Initially assigned treatments were maintained for the rest of the study. All test areas except area 4 (control) were sterilized before application. Probiotic solutions were applied every day during days 1, 2, and 3. Skin microbiome samples were taken with commercial skin stripping method (3S-Biokit, C+K electronic) based on fast hardening cyanoacrylate glue at 16 time points (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 17, 24, 38, 52&#x02009;days) to monitor microbiome dynamics (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). DNA was recovered from the strip with a high-temperature extraction solution (see the &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d; section). We included sampling at day 0 before any probiotic solution was applied. Genomic DNA was extracted and sequenced by NGS-based genotyping.16S rRNA gene profiling was used to assess microbiome composition at the genus level. SLST profiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] was used to identify relative proportions of different <italic>C. acnes</italic> strains. Barcoded libraries were constructed and sequenced by an Illumina Miseq machine (Illumina, USA). The obtained data was quality filtered, mapped, and clustered (see the &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d; section).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Skin microbiome composition dynamics after donor transplantation. <bold>a</bold> Skin surface areas of study.

Based on this analysis, we could identify five main clusters of <italic>C.</italic> acnes profiles on the skin. We decided to name these five clusters dermatotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, analogous to the term enterotype defined for the gut microbiome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] or stomatotype for the oral microbiome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This classification is helpful to study groups of subjects having similar microbiomes, and it facilitates finding functional associations of certain microbiome signatures. These dermatotypes do not, however, describe discrete clusters with fixed abundances of particular strains, but rather show gradients of variability in these abundances between samples. The skin microbiomes of dermatotype 1 are driven by <italic>C. acnes</italic> L1, dermatotype 2 by <italic>C. acnes</italic> D1, dermatotype 3 by C3 and A5, dermatotype 4 by D1 and H1, and dermatotype 5 by <italic>C. acnes</italic> A1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Second, we observed a quantitative and qualitative increase in similarity between donor and recipient microbiomes after only 3&#x02009;days of application. For each solution, we assessed engraftment levels (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1) and the change of the composition of the <italic>C. acnes</italic> subpopulation before the treatment at three predetermined concentrations (10<sup>4</sup>, 10<sup>6</sup>, and 10<sup>8</sup>&#x02009;CFU/mL; see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Engraftment is measured as the distance between the microbiome composition of the tested sample and the applied solution (see the &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d; section).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p><italic>C. acnes</italic> population dynamics using SLST typing. <bold>a</bold> PCA representation of the different dermatotypes (based on SLST typing).

Some of the applied mixtures engraft better. PA mixtures engraft better than CM at any concentration, and the highest concentration (PA8 or 10<sup>8</sup>&#x02009;CFU/mL) has significantly higher engraftment values (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S1 and S2). The values show that engraftment is greater with the H1+A1+D1 solution, followed by H1+A1 and (H1), in this order (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). Expectedly, higher concentrations show greater engraftments (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2). PA8 containing H1, A1, and D1 engrafts significantly better than all the other groups. Both of the CM samples engraft less than PA. CM from donor 1 engrafts less than CM donor 2 (see donor compositions in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3). Interestingly, donor 2 has a 1.8-fold greater ratio of <italic>C. acnes</italic> over <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> species (<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>) than donor 1.</p><p id="Par11">Not all subjects responded equally to the applied samples, indicating significant variability among recipient areas that sometimes relate to defined <italic>C. acnes</italic>-based dermatotypes. Indeed, we measure some variability on subject-to-subject results (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4); oscillations observed for a single patient in particular days are not considered significant. For instance, dermatotype 4 shows higher engraftment than others (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, Tukey&#x02019;s test). Interestingly, this dermatotype is dominated by H1 and comprises notable levels of D1 and A1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). We did not observe an association between Shannon diversity of individual subjects and engraftment levels (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5).</p><p id="Par12">We also classified patients according to the different 16S-based dermatotypes. In this case, we observe 3 different types: type one dominated by <italic>Cutibacterium</italic>, type two dominated with <italic>Cutibacterium</italic> and some <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>, and a more widespread type 3, with <italic>Leifsonia</italic> being more abundant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b). Interestingly, we observe important anticorrelation between <italic>Cutibacterium</italic> and <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>. <italic>Leifsonia</italic> seems to show more co-occurrence with <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S6). Patients with type 3 show a significantly higher engraftment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). We hypothesize that patients of type 3 are not fully colonized with <italic>Cutibacterium</italic>, and therefore, it is easier to establish a new population.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Complete microbiome dynamics at the 16S level. <bold>a</bold> PCA representation of the different dermatotypes (based on 16S typing). <bold>b</bold> Composition of the dermatotypes (based on 16S typing). <bold>c</bold> Average engraftment of different dermatotypes (based on 16S typing)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40168_2019_709_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par13">We have demonstrated that the composition of the human skin can be modulated by applying <italic>C. acnes</italic> strain H1 with positive features isolated from healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Combining H1 (type IB) with other strains such as D1 (type IA) and A1 (type IA) significantly enhances engraftment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). A1 is the most widespread strain, and D1 has been described as not being associated with acne [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

Recent clinical studies already revealed that application of natural bacteria into the skin can decrease skin pH and improve moisture retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This method opens the possibility to develop probiotic solutions that help the human skin reverting disease microbiome states to healthy ones. Also, synthetic biology is generating smart microbes with the abilities to detect and treat disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. New methods to replace and modulate our bacterial flora are necessary. We expect that this methodology could be used to study and modify skin microbial components and have broad implications for future therapies and research in skin microbiome and related diseases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Donor and recipient group definition</title><p id="Par18">Donors were healthy males and females between 22 and 40&#x02009;years old, male and female, healthy individuals.
