    "Background:In various biological processes and cell functions, Post Translational Modifications (PTMs) bear critical significance. Hydroxylation of proline residue is one kind of PTM, which occurs following protein synthesis. The experimental determination of hydroxyproline sites in an uncharacterized protein sequence requires extensive, time-consuming and expensive tests. Methods:With the torrential slide of protein sequences produced in the post-genomic age, certain remarkable computational strategies are desired to overwhelm the issue. Keeping in view the composition and sequence order effect within polypeptide chains, an innovative in-silico> predictor via a mathematical model is proposed. Results:Later, it was stringently verified using self-consistency, cross-validation and jackknife tests on benchmark datasets. It was established after a rigorous jackknife test that the new predictor values are superior to the values predicted by previous methodologies. Conclusion:This new mathematical technique is the most appropriate and encouraging as compared with the existing models."
