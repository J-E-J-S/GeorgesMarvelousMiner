    "Activation of macrophages and overexpression of TNFα is associated with the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanisms leading to TNFα overexpression are still unknown. 5-methylocytosine (5-mC) is an epigenetic modification that is associated with silenced genes. Recent studies showed that it is converted to 5-hydroxylmethylocytosine (5-hmC) and reactivates gene expression through the action of the family of Ten-Eleven-Translocation (TET1-3) enzymes. In this study, we show that 5-hmC levels are increased globally and specifically in the TNFα promoter during the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. In addition, the levels of 5-hmC are increased upon LPS stimulation of macrophages. Furthermore, CRIPSR stable knockout of TET1 decreases the expression of TNFα and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, we showed that TET1 contributes to the activation of macrophages possibly through regulation of 5-hydroxymethylation in the promoter of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. The TET1 enzyme could be a promising therapeutic target to inhibit the persistent inflammation caused by macrophages in chronic inflammatory diseases."
