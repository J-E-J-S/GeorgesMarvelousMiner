However, the mechanisms leading to TNF&#x003b1; overexpression are still unknown. 5-methylocytosine (5-mC) is an epigenetic modification that is associated with silenced genes. Recent studies showed that it is converted to 5-hydroxylmethylocytosine (5-hmC) and reactivates gene expression through the action of the family of Ten-Eleven-Translocation (TET1-3) enzymes. In this study, we show that 5-hmC levels are increased globally and specifically in the TNF&#x003b1; promoter during the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. In addition, the levels of 5-hmC are increased upon LPS stimulation of macrophages. Furthermore, CRIPSR stable knockout of TET1 decreases the expression of TNF&#x003b1; and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, we showed that TET1 contributes to the activation of macrophages possibly through regulation of 5-hydroxymethylation in the promoter of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. The TET1 enzyme could be a promising therapeutic target to inhibit the persistent inflammation caused by macrophages in chronic inflammatory diseases.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010686</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Institute of Innovation and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>667837</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neidhart</surname><given-names>Michel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Swiss Federal commission of scholarships for foreign students</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Fangfang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This project has received funding from the European Union&#x02019;s Horizon 2020 European Institute of Innovation and Technology research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 667837 which support the consumables and the salary of EK.

Other members include monocytes, dendritic cells (DC), neutrophils, B cells and mast cells. They express TLRs receptors and variety of receptors facilitating phagocytosis. Macrophages are classified into two classes M1 and M2 depending on their function. M1 macrophages are considered important for defense against pathogens and anti-tumor immunity. In contrast, M2 macrophages have an anti-inflammatory role and express high levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10). The M1 macrophages are implicated in autoimmune diseases by different studies[<xref rid="pone.0218551.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0218551.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. For example, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial macrophages are the main TNF&#x003b1; producing cells in the inflamed synovium[<xref rid="pone.0218551.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This cytokine has been therapeutically targeted with successful results in patients with RA. However, the mechanism of periodical overproduction of TNF&#x003b1;, associated with disease flares, is still unknown.</p><p>Few studies have studied the role of epigenetic control at the TNF&#x003b1; locus in cell lines and primary cells. DNA methylation has shown to regulate TNF&#x003b1; gene transcription. Thus, analysis of the TNF&#x003b1;promoter in three human cell lines showed that there is a high level of DNA demethylation in the cells expressing high levels of TNF&#x003b1;[<xref rid="pone.0218551.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, demethylation of the TNF&#x003b1; promoter in cell lines using the DNMT1 inhibitor 5-azacytidine increased the transcription of TNF&#x003b1;[<xref rid="pone.0218551.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Recent findings have shown that 5-methlcytosine (5-mC) modification of DNA can be converted to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) through the activation of the family of Ten-Eleven-Translocation (TET1-3) enzymes, which play an important role in the active DNA demethylation pathway[<xref rid="pone.0218551.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. TET can further oxidize 5-hmC to 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine. These two oxidized forms, recognized by thymine DNA glycosylase, can be converted back to 5-cytosine through the so-called active demethylation pathways[<xref rid="pone.0218551.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Alternatively, 5-mC can be diluted through DNA replication by a passive demethylation process, as this occurs in RA synovial fibroblasts[<xref rid="pone.0218551.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>TET enzymes were firstly discovered to be involved in the differentiation of embryonic stem cells[<xref rid="pone.0218551.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recent evidence showed that the TET2 enzyme regulates the differentiation of Tregs [<xref rid="pone.0218551.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and the cytokine expression of T cells[<xref rid="pone.0218551.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In particular, TET2 has shown to reduce inflammation by repressing the expression of IL-6 [<xref rid="pone.0218551.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and to play a role in the differentiation of human monocytes to dendritic cells. In addition, TET2 overexpression can cause myeloid malignancies, while reduced expression of TET genes as well as 5-hmC was also observed in cancers, especially colon cancer[<xref rid="pone.0218551.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Here we aim to investigate the 5-hmC modification and DNA demethylation pathway mediated by TET enzymes in macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). It is shown for the first time that 5-hmC and the enzyme TET1 contribute to the activation of macrophages through the regulation of 5-hydroxymethylation at the TNF&#x003b1; promoter.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cell culture</title><p>The human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 (Cell Lines Service GmbH) was cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Life Technologies, Basel, Switzerland) and used below passage 10.

In the meantime, the Mule entry vector have been digested with BfuA1. The predigested vector was ligated with the sgRNA oligos using a mixture of T4 ligase buffer and T4 ligase for 30 min at room temperature. Next, the cloned plasmids were transformed into competent E. coli according to manufacture protocol. Positive clones that contain the sgRNA sequences were cultured overnight and a Midiprep was used to purify the sgRNA plasmid DNA. Last, each sgRNA vectors and a Mule CAS9 vector (plasmid 62134, Addgene) were recombined into a Lentiviral GFP destination vector (plasmid 62175, Addgene).

Therefore, we searched for global changes of the 5-hmC and 5-mC modifications using THP1 monocytes differentiated with PMA for 48 hours. Interestingly, we observed an increase of 5-hmC during the macrophage differentiation process. We could reverse the upregulation of 5-hmC in the CRISPR TET1 knockout cell line and this further support the role of this enzyme in macrophage differentiation. Similarly, this increase of 5-hmC has also been detected in mouse embryonic stem cell and immune cell differentiation processes[<xref rid="pone.0218551.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218551.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0218551.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Since changes of 5-hmC affect gene promoters and enhancers, we searched for the occurrence of 5-hmC in the promoter of TNF&#x003b1; which has been previously described to have low levels of methylation [<xref rid="pone.0218551.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and strongly expressed in THP1 cells. Our results showed a strong enrichment in 5-hmC levels of TNF&#x003b1; cytokine during differentiation. This effect is not unexpected because other reports have shown that T cell cytokines such as IL-4, INF&#x003b3; and IL-17 have enriched 5-hmC depending on the T cell subset that expresses these cytokines[<xref rid="pone.0218551.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0218551.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The demethylation of CpG sites in the promoter or regulatory regions has also been described in Treg cell differentiation. Three intrinsic enhancers of Foxp3 transcription factor are enriched with 5-hmC during Treg cell differentiation[<xref rid="pone.0218551.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Macrophages are key cells in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. During disease progression, these cells can react to various stimuli such as PAMPs, DAMPs, immune complexes and other immune cells. These pathways stimulate macrophages to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF&#x003b1;. In the current study, we mimicked the inflammatory stimuli using LPS and hypothesized that the demethylation of the TNF&#x003b1; promoter occurred during inflammation. Interestingly, we observed that macrophages have higher enrichment of 5-hmC during LPS stimulation and conclude that this epigenetic modification increases TNF&#x003b1; expression. It is known from genome wide 5-hmC map experiments and transcriptomic studies that 5-hmC enrichment correlates with gene expression[<xref rid="pone.0218551.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In order of find the causative factor for the increase in 5-hmC, we silenced the TET enzymes separately and measured TNF&#x003b1; expression. In addition, we created a stable TET1 knockout cell line that confirmed with reductions of TNF&#x003b1; mRNA and protein expression. These experiments revealed that TET1, but not TET2 or TET3, is a regulator of TNF&#x003b1; expression and possibly of other pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, these results confirmed the observation of previous reports that showed no change in TNF&#x003b1; gene expression in the TET2 knockdown murine bone marrow macrophages[<xref rid="pone.0218551.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, our results propose that TET enzymes have distinct functions in the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p><p>Interestingly, the CRISPR TET1 stable knockout line IL8 transcription was not affected but only the release into cell culture supernatant. The TET1 knockout has shown in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to affect the upregulation and downregulation of multiple genes[<xref rid="pone.0218551.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, there is a possibility that TET1 affects the IL-8 release indirectly through the upregulation of various mechanisms. A RNA sequencing experiment using the TET1 knockout cell line can identify potential novel factors, which regulate the expression and/or release of other proinflammatory cytokines.</p><p>In conclusion, TET1 enzyme is an important target of inflammatory macrophages and could provide a new therapeutic target for diseases such as RA and other inflammatory diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0218551.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wynn</surname><given-names>TA</given-names></name>. <article-title>Protective and pathogenic functions of macrophage subsets</article-title>. <source>Nat Rev Immunol</source>. <year>2011</year>;<volume>11</volume>(<issue>11</issue>):<fpage>723</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>37</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1038/nri3073</pub-id>
