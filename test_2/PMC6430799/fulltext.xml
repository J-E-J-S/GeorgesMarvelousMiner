Due to its 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; directionality, a DNA sequence is distinct from a mirrored sequence arranged in reverse nucleotide-order, and is therefore chiral. A given sequence and its opposing chiral partner sequence share many properties, such as nucleotide composition and sequence entropy. Here we demonstrate that chiral DNA sequence pairs also perform equivalently during molecular and bioinformatic techniques that underpin genetic analysis, including PCR amplification, hybridization, whole-genome, target-enriched and nanopore sequencing, sequence alignment and variant detection. Given these shared properties, synthetic DNA sequences mirroring clinically relevant or analytically challenging regions of the human genome are ideal controls for clinical genomics. The addition of synthetic chiral sequences (sequins) to patient tumor samples can prevent false-positive and false-negative mutation detection to improve diagnosis.

These artefacts are complex and overlapping, and vary across different regions of the human genome, emphasizing the value of sequence-matched controls that can measure the impact of technical variation on a given sequence, in a given assay. Sequins can be used to rapidly assess operational performance and gauge the quality of accompanying samples. Low-quality samples, such as clinical specimens that are excessively degraded by formalin fixation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, can be easily identified by comparison to internal sequin controls, and technical artefacts can be disentangled from meaningful signal, such as mutation signatures in human tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par43">The chiral design principle is also simple and flexible. Synthetic chiral sequences can be created to represent almost any human DNA sequence, including analytically challenging loci (such as microsatellite repeats) that are otherwise difficult to reliably assess<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. By preserving sequence context and nucleotide composition, sequins provide faithful analytic proxies for these features. Moreover, the catalog of matching chiral standards can be easily expanded as the inventory of clinically informative human genome regions continues to grow.</p><p id="Par44">The benefits of using sequins, or any other spike-in control, during NGS experiments must be weighed against the cost of sequencing reads that are necessarily sacrificed for their analysis. This limitation is of minimal importance during whole-genome NGS, where no more than ~1% of reads must be sacrificed in order to achieve matched stoichiometry between chiral standards and the diploid human genome. During targeted sequencing approaches, a larger fraction of the sequenced library may be sacrificed, with this depending on the collective size of captured genome regions relative to captured controls, and therefore differing for alternative capture panel designs. For a typical design, users can attain the benefits to performance and reproducibility described above at a &#x0003c;5% increase in sequencing cost.</p><p id="Par45">The diagnosis of human mutations by genome (and exome) sequencing suffers from a high false-positive rate and an undetermined false-negative rate, with the resulting impact of misdiagnosis during clinical care unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>.

To ensure chiral pairs had the attributes of real human sequences, we retrieved continuous subsequences from the human reference genome (<italic>hg38</italic>). These were not edited or shuffled, and represent perfect synthetic copies of real human sequences (<italic>fwd</italic>), while their chiral partner sequences (<italic>rev)</italic> were created simply by arranging <italic>fwd</italic> molecules in reverse nucleotide order.</p><p id="Par47">After confirming the similar performance of matched <italic>fwd/rev</italic> synthetic DNA sequences in various assays (see below), we expanded our scope, creating a large catalog of 1.8&#x02009;kb synthetic <italic>rev</italic> molecules, each the chiral equivalent to a subsequence within <italic>hg38</italic>. Rather than generating synthetic <italic>fwd</italic> sequences, these were compared to real human DNA samples, with <italic>rev</italic> sequences only differing from their corresponding genome regions at the positions of genetic variants in a given human sample. Sequences selected for synthesis were centered on the following genomic features: sites of common genetic variants (NA12878), exons of cancer-associated genes (COSMIC), local regions of low (&#x0003c;20%) or high (&#x0003e;70%) GC-content, and clinical microsatellite marker sequences (Bethesda panel)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. For this study, we created and surveyed a total of 223&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1.8&#x02009;kb synthetic chiral sequences, covering 450&#x02009;kb of genome sequence and encompassing 252 variants/mutations.

Synthetic chiral sequences were amplified by bacterial culture, excised by restriction enzyme digest, quantified by UV fluorometry (Thermofisher Qbuit), and combined into a variety of larger mixtures using a liquid-handling robot (Eppendorf). For experiments involving synthetic <italic>fwd/rev</italic> pairs, all sequences were combined at equal concentration. In the larger mixtures comprising <italic>rev</italic> molecules representing genetic variants and disease mutations, different genotypes were emulated by combining synthetic molecules representing reference and variant alleles in precise ratios (as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>). Heterozygous variants were represented by paired reference/variant alleles at equal abundance and homozygous variants were represented by the variant allele alone. To emulate the heterogeneous somatic VAFs encountered in tumor samples, we created a ladder ranging from VAF&#x02009;=&#x02009;100% to VAF&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.1%, serially diluting variant alleles such that each step on the ladder was at half the frequency of the previous step, with 7&#x02013;9 somatic variants at each level. In addition, we created a separate mixture in which only the reference sequence for each site was included. This mixture provides a wild-type background against which somatic mutations (encoded in the first mixture) can be called, emulating to the popular approach of matched tumor/normal sample analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>PCR amplification of DNA chiral pairs</title><p id="Par49">To test the amplification efficiency of chiral pairs of DNA sequences, we designed primers targeting mirrored PCR amplicons within a single 2.8&#x02009;kb <italic>fwd/rev</italic> pair of sequences (see above). Specifically, we designated 14&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;PCR amplicons (120&#x02009;bp each) within each template, placing these such that every amplicon in the <italic>fwd</italic> template had an exact <italic>rev</italic> equivalent, bookended by primers (20&#x02009;bp each) that perfectly mirrored each other (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

Cycle threshold (CT) and melting temperate values were recorded for each reaction. Because they were amplified from a common template, the order of detection among <italic>fwd/rev</italic> amplicons provides a direct measure of the relative efficiencies within each orientation category.</p><p id="Par50">We then performed endpoint PCR (40 cycles) to detect paired chiral amplicons under a range of reaction conditions.

PCR was performed using KAPA HiFi Hotstart Ready mix (temperature experiment) or Taq Flexi DNA Polymerase (magnesium experiment) on a BioRad thermo-cycler, and PCR products were visualized by gel electrophoresis.

For chiral sequences anchored to common germline variants or challenging genome sites (see above), the whole 1.8&#x02009;kb genome region was included in the capture design, whereas for cancer genes, only exonic sequences were captured (analogous to the design of an exome sequencing panel). From this design, we retrieved the sequences for all oligonucleotide probes targeting a region represented by synthetic chiral standards.

Because the identity of every base within synthetic chiral standards is known, erroneous variant calls (FPs) can be distinguished from true variants (TPs). This information allowed us to optimize filtering thresholds (rather than using defaults) for each experiment, selecting minimum values for the scoring criteria provided by Strelka2 (QSS/QSI and SomaticEVS) that would exclude all FPs, while maximizing the number of TPs and human variant candidates that were retained (this process is visualized in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10c</xref>).
