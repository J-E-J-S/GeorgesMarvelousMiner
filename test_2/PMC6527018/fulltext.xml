The aspartyl protease (aspartic peptidase) class of proteases similarly serve many roles but in particular have been implicated in virulence and pathogenicity of microorganisms such as HIV, <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, and <italic>Candida</italic> [<xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>]. In several emerging and established fungal pathogens, genome sequencing has revealed unique expansions in the number of aspartyl protease-encoding genes and it is thought that this is commensurate with the shift towards a pathogenic lifestyle.</p><p>The acquisition or expansion of genes is a potential source of variation that can lead to the generation of new virulence factors. For example in the chytrid fungus <italic>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</italic>, responsible for amphibian infection and death worldwide, one aspartyl protease family is expanded to 77 genes (4.5 fold) relative to a closely related, less pathogenic, species [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]. Similarly, in the entomopathogenic genus <italic>Metarhizium, M. anisopliae</italic>, which has a broad host range, has significantly more aspartyl protease-encoding genes than its locust-specific relative, <italic>M. acridum</italic> [<xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. In both instances the hypothesis is that this expansion plays an important role in virulence and pathogenicity; however, in neither case has this been tested functionally.</p><p>The most thoroughly studied families of aspartyl proteases belong to species in the <italic>Candida</italic> genus. These genes, known as secreted aspartyl proteases (SAPs), have been identified and/or characterized in <italic>C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. dubliniensis</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> [<xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>]. SAP genes were originally described in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, and several of the 10 members of this expansion have been associated with distinct cellular traits, including hyphal formation, adhesion, dimorphic switching and host cell apoptosis [<xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>]. Despite some controversy due to complications with the genetic background of these mutants, and a revision of their importance to virulence in a murine model of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>], a number of these SAP genes have <italic>bona fide</italic> roles in immune responses, biofilm metabolism and mucosal infection [<xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>]. In <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic>, production of three SAP proteins varies with respect to the tissue infected as well as between clinical isolates; thus multiple factors influence a single process such as infection [<xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>].</p><p><italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> has two aspartyl protease-encoding genes and one of these, <italic>pep1</italic>, is expressed during infection in several animal models [<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref>]. Mutant studies show that Pep1 is capable of degrading extracellular matrix proteins in the host, but loss does not affect tissue invasion or host mortality [<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>]. Therefore, while aspartyl proteases appear to have clear roles relevant to infection, both in species where these genes are expanded in number and those with only one to a few genes, loss does not always have a major impact on virulence. For both <italic>Candida</italic> species and <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, this may be due to functional redundancy between members of the expanded families or other protease classes. An important distinction between <italic>Candida</italic> and many other morphologically complex fungi is that the latter also have other secreted protease classes besides the SAPs.</p><p>Despite these studies in <italic>Candida</italic> species and <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, the function of aspartyl proteases in most other pathogens, including <italic>T. marneffei</italic> has not been examined. <italic>T. marneffei</italic> (formerly <italic>Penicillium marneffei)</italic> is a thermally dimorphic pathogen of humans that is endemic to Southeast Asia. The incidence of talaromycosis (formerly penicilliosis) peaked with the AIDS epidemic in this region [<xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>]. <italic>T. marneffei</italic> is capable of growing as both multinucleate septate hyphae and uninucleate yeast cells dividing by fission [<xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>]. The transition from hyphae to yeast and germination of conidia at 37&#x000b0;C <italic>in vitro</italic> occurs via an arthroconidial hyphal phase consisting of uninucleate, branched and septate cells. <italic>In vivo</italic> the transition from conidia to yeast cells is direct. The yeast form predominates during infection, where <italic>T. marneffei</italic> grows and proliferates within host phagocytic cells thereby avoiding exposure to, and clearance by, the immune system.</p><p>In this study, we describe a major expansion of aspartyl protease-encoding genes in <italic>T. marneffei</italic>, orthologous to the <italic>A. fumigatus pep1</italic> gene. The expansion, named <bold>p</bold>aralogue <bold>o</bold>f <bold><italic>p</italic></bold><italic>ep</italic> (<italic>pop</italic>), was found to be monophyletic and is associated with repetitive elements and subtelomeric regions of the <italic>T. marneffei</italic> genome. This family shows evidence of significant positive selection as well as copy number variation amongst <italic>T. marneffei</italic> isolates. Despite these rapid evolutionary changes, the functional domains are conserved in the majority of the proteins. Based on their expression profiles, five <italic>pop</italic> genes were selected for functional analysis. Single and double deletions of these genes revealed cumulative and interdependent impacts on yeast cell formation during macrophage infection, while localization studies revealed unique cellular targeting during <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> growth. The data suggest that the expansion of these genes may have been an important step in the evolution of pathogenicity in <italic>T. marneffei</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Results</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>The aspartyl protease expansion is monophyletic and variable</title><p>A comparative genomics study of 17 Eurotiomycetes revealed an increase in the number of genes encoding aspartyl proteases in <italic>T. marneffei</italic> (unpublished data).

This analysis revealed that surface residues were more likely to show variation between individual proteins of the <italic>pop</italic> expansion, while internal residues were significantly more conserved. To quantify the differences in variation between internal and external residues each residue was assigned a score for variation and surface exposure (solvent accessibility). A negative correlation was observed between surface exposure and variation indicating that positive selection occurring in these genes is predominantly associated with the protein surface (Supplementary Figure 1(b)).</p><p>Despite the changes in protein sequence due to positive selection the residues and domains that define aspartyl proteases are conserved in the <italic>pop</italic> expansion. These include the pre-pro peptide required for secretion, the activation peptide and the aspartic acid containing active site motifs. The secretion signal and activation peptide are widely conserved in this expansion with some important exceptions (Supplementary Figure 2(a)). The <italic>pepA</italic> product shows a moderate reduction in conservation in both sequences while <italic>popP</italic> and <italic>popH</italic> products show additional residues in the secretion signal as well as differences in the activation peptide compared to the other <italic>pop</italic> proteins. The <italic>popE</italic> activation peptide is disrupted which may impact function. Expression of <italic>popK</italic> has not been detected under any condition tested to date so the lack of conservation in this gene is likely to be unimportant. The core catalytic residues of aspartyl proteases are made up of two DTG or DSG motifs, which are highly conserved across taxa [<xref rid="CIT0021">21</xref>] (Supplementary Figure 2(b)). The first of these sites is conserved in 15 of 23 <italic>pop</italic> genes while the second is conserved in 19, with 15 showing conservation of both motifs. Five other proteins show conservative substitutions from G to A in the third residue of the first catalytic core, which is unlikely to affect function. As with the activation and secretion signals of <italic>popK</italic> the catalytic sites of this gene are disrupted. Cysteine residues, which form the structurally important C-terminal disulphide bridge, are absolutely conserved in <italic>pop</italic> proteins.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2003"><title>The <italic>pop</italic> genes are associated with flanking repetitive sequences</title><p>In order to understand the mechanism for the expansion of these genes in <italic>T. marneffei</italic> and the variation in copy number between strains, repetitive sequences were examined in the flanking regions surrounding each <italic>pop</italic> gene. In 17 of 23 <italic>pop</italic> genes, sequences within 10 kb of the genes were found elsewhere in the genome (<xref rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>). In many cases, more than 10 other copies of the duplicated sequence were identified. Longer regions of duplicated DNA are often associated with transposable elements. Further analysis of these regions identified a number of different transposable element (TE) families including copia and gypsy retrotransposons as well as hAT and mariner DNA transposons, while other repetitive regions were not associated with any known TE (<xref rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, no single transposon family was uniquely associated with the expanded <italic>pop</italic> family. However, one clade of 10 <italic>pop</italic> genes lack introns entirely and are likely to have formed through an RNA-mediated retrotransposition event (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>, event indicated by black arrowhead).

</p><p>To examine the secretion of these proteases by <italic>T. marneffei</italic> during macrophage infection, western blot analysis was used to identify the presence of these proteins in fractions of <italic>T. marneffei</italic> infected macrophages (see Materials and Methods). J774 macrophages were infected with conidia from each of the <italic>pepA::mCherry, popP::mCherry, popH::mCherry, popS::mCherry</italic> and <italic>popO::mCherry</italic> strains and protein was extracted from purified yeast cells isolated from within macrophages and the remaining macrophage lysate lacking <italic>T. marneffei</italic> yeast. A strain carrying a histone H1 mCherry fusion (<italic>H1::mCherry</italic>) allele was used as a control. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of the H1::mCherry protein in the <italic>T. marneffei</italic> yeast extract but not in the macrophage fraction (Supplementary Figure 4). In contrast, the Pop::mCherry fusion proteins were detected in both <italic>T. marneffei</italic> yeast and macrophage factions. This was most clearly evident for the <italic>popP::mCherry</italic> strain (Supplementary Figure 4), consistent with the expression profiling data that showed the <italic>popP</italic> gene has the highest expression of all the <italic>pop</italic> family members. A higher level of PopP::mCherry fusion protein is observed in the <italic>T. marneffei</italic> yeast cell faction. Coupled with the co-infection results, these data strongly suggest that at least a number of the proteases encoded by the <italic>pop</italic> gene family are secreted and function outside of <italic>T. marneffei</italic> cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S0003"><title>Discussion</title><p>The evolution of traits that permit exploitation of new environments can proceed by the repurposing of genes with or without loss of the starting function, or the evolution or acquisition of new genes. While the former is constrained if there is selection acting to maintain the ancestral function of a gene, this is not so for the latter. The evolution or acquisition of new genes can occur by horizontal gene transfer or by gene amplification followed by neofunctionalisation. Gene amplification as a mechanism for evolving new traits provides redundancy for maintaining the original function, relaxes selection on individual genes and increases the level of the gene product, which may in itself have selective advantages.</p><p>Here we have described the identification of a novel expansion of aspartyl protease-encoding genes in <italic>T. marneffei</italic> that may have been critical in the evolution of pathogenicity. <italic>T. marneffei</italic> is the only identified animal pathogenic species in the <italic>Talaromyces</italic> genus and the only species in the Eurotiomycetes order that exhibits dimorphic switching; an essential trait for intracellular growth. This study showed that the genes in this expansion form one monophyletic clade, with only single orthologues of the proteases present in other species. In most cases, these genes are associated with subtelomeric regions and surrounded by repetitive sequences, including transposable elements, suggesting mechanisms for the genesis of the expansion. Such mechanisms may have included transposon-driven duplication or unequal crossing-over between repetitive sequences. The role of transposons in the evolution of this gene family is further supported by the presence of a sub-clade of <italic>pop</italic> genes that lack introns, and which are likely to have arisen by retrotransposition. Furthermore, these genes vary in copy number amongst <italic>T. marneffei</italic> isolates, indicating an ongoing dynamic process in the evolution of this family. Given these observations, we hypothesized that this family may have evolved early in the acquisition of pathogenicity in <italic>T. marneffei</italic>.</p><p>The activity of genes within expanded gene families is associated with virulence in a number of protozoan and fungal species. These include the VAR genes of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, the VSG genes of <italic>Trypanosoma bruscei</italic> and the TLO family in <italic>Candida</italic> species [<xref rid="CIT0023">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0025">25</xref>]. In some of these examples, the gene products have diverged from the ancestral form and the expression of individual genes can vary significantly within and between cellular populations. For cell surface-localized gene products, like the VAR and VSG gene families, this leads to antigenic variation in a population, enabling evasion of the host immune system. In <italic>T. marneffei</italic>, variation in <italic>pop</italic> protein sequence showed clear positive selection and was primarily observed in residues exposed to the host. Given it is predicted that <italic>pop</italic> gene products are secreted, this is consistent with the hypothesis that this may provide a source of antigenic variation for <italic>T. marneffei</italic> to allow escape from detection or help modulate immune interactions during infection.</p><p>For the <italic>T. marneffei pop</italic> genes, it is not clear if the expression of each gene shows significant cell to cell variation, as would be expected if they were functioning similarly to the VAR and VSG genes, where switching expression from one member of the gene family to another permits immune evasion and affects infection outcome. Expression profiling suggests that this may not be a significant factor in the action of these genes as each gene showed distinct cell type and growth condition dependent patterns. Fluorescent tagging of members of the Pop family confirmed the expression profiles and revealed novel localization for PopH and PopP. Collectively, these data suggest that at least some <italic>pop</italic> genes in this family are more likely to require the enzymatic function of the gene product to assist the growth of <italic>T. marneffei</italic> under various environmental conditions. This does not preclude some or all of these genes also serving a more structural antigenic variation role.</p><p>Aspartyl protease expansions are found in a small number of other pathogenic fungi, where they are proposed to influence pathogenicity and infection. In species of the <italic>Candida</italic> genus, the number of secreted aspartyl protease (SAP) genes differ, with larger numbers hypothesized to confer greater pathogenicity [<xref rid="CIT0026">26</xref>]. In <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, SAPs are associated with distinct stages of pathogenesis. Mutations in SAP 1&#x02013;3 show virulence defects in murine vaginitis models while SAP 4&#x02013;6 are implicated in peritonitis [<xref rid="CIT0027">27</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0028">28</xref>]. Deletions of several of the genes in <italic>T. marneffei</italic> that are expressed during <italic>ex vivo</italic> macrophage growth (<italic>pepA, popS</italic>, and <italic>popO</italic>) led to reductions in yeast cell formation under these conditions, and combinatorial deletions of these genes showed more severe or synthetic phenotypes. This suggests that these genes play a role in virulence and the strong conservation of the functional domains in these gene products is consistent with the idea that their enzymatic activity is important. Moreover, the strong positive selection signature that was restricted to the <italic>pop</italic> expansion, the partially redundant function for some of these genes and the ongoing variation in copy number amongst <italic>T. marneffei</italic> strains suggests that the biological roles(s) of these genes may be a recent development in the evolution of pathogenicity of <italic>T. marneffei</italic> and that these genes may act as a source of new effectors to allow <italic>T. marneffei</italic> to respond to new environments. Some genes such as <italic>popP</italic> and <italic>popH</italic> showed minor or no phenotypes when deleted despite strong expression and may therefore be functionally redundant with one or more other <italic>pop</italic> genes.</p><p>The <italic>pop</italic> gene products have conserved pre-pro peptide sequences suggesting that they are secreted proteins. Localization of PopH and PopP <italic>in vitro</italic> was to the septa of arthroconidial filaments, which go on to produce yeast cells, and dividing yeast cells, suggestive of a role in the division of yeast cells by fission, a process that is unique to <italic>T. marneffei</italic> amongst the Eurotiomycetes. However, single and double mutants of these two genes showed no defects in this process, indicating that their role is non-essential or redundant. Localization of PopP, PopS, PopH and PopO <italic>ex vivo</italic> was perinuclear and vesicular, typically representing secretory machinery such as the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. While none of the gene products were detected extracellularly by fluorescence microscopy, we showed that some of these gene products could be detected in macrophage lysates after infection with <italic>T. marneffei</italic>, even after <italic>T. marneffei</italic> had been removed from the infected cells, and that complementation of the mutant phenotypes could be achieved by coinfection of macrophages with two mutant strains. These data strongly support the prediction that the <italic>pop</italic> gene products are secreted and that the lack of detection extracellularly by fluorescence microscopy indicates a sensitivity issue due to either diffusion or degradation of these proteins. This is consistent with the PepA data, which showed localization immediately adjacent to the cell wall, thus likely outside the cell membrane. In <italic>C. albicans</italic> SAP9 is localized to the cell wall and mediates interactions with phagocytic cells of the immune system [<xref rid="CIT0029">29</xref>]. Similarly, <italic>pep1</italic>, the orthologue of <italic>pepA</italic> in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> is classified as an allergen and as such interacts with the host immune system [<xref rid="CIT0030">30</xref>]. The <italic>pepA</italic> gene may also mediate intracellular interactions between <italic>T. marneffei</italic> and host immune cells such as macrophages.</p><p>Another possible role for PepA is in an activation pathway for secreted <italic>pop</italic> proteins, which need to be proteolytically cleaved for function (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(c)</xref>). Some support for this hypothesis comes from the phenotypes of double deletion mutants. Combinations with <italic>popS</italic> show that it acts independently of other <italic>pop</italic> genes in yeast cell formation. Conversely, <italic>pepA</italic> or <italic>popP</italic> deletions combined with <italic>popO</italic> show epistatic effects suggesting that they act redundantly in one stage of a pathway that also includes <italic>popO</italic>. If this hypothesis is correct, it is more complex because the <italic>popP;pepA</italic> double deletion did not mimic the <italic>popO</italic> single deletion. Given that only five <italic>pop</italic> genes were characterized in depth in this study it is entirely possible that one or more of the other <italic>pop</italic> genes may also contribute to this pathway, thereby compensating for the loss of activity in <italic>popP</italic> and <italic>pepA</italic>.</p><p>Overall the findings clearly show that the <italic>pop</italic> gene family contributes to <italic>T. marneffei</italic> intracellular growth, a key aspect to initiation of infection. Despite the large number of genes comprising this family and their potential for functional overlap, the contributions of specific members to the germination of <italic>T. marneffei</italic> inside macrophages appears to be distinct, underscoring the importance of this expanded group. Recent studies have identified other expanded gene families as significant contributors to <italic>T. marneffei</italic> pathogenicity [<xref rid="CIT0031">31</xref>] (unpublished data). Further analysis of all members of the expansion is necessary to understand fully the role these proteases play in the pathogenicity of <italic>T. marneffei</italic>. Interestingly, anti-retroviral therapies used in HIV treatment that target the HIV aspartyl protease can inhibit aspartyl proteases of <italic>C. albicans</italic> and have been shown to influence the virulence of this species <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="CIT0032">32</xref>]. If these compounds also inhibit <italic>pop</italic> proteins in <italic>T. marneffei</italic> they may open new avenues of treatment, especially in HIV infected patients where these medications may already be in use.</p></sec><sec id="S0004"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S0004-S2001"><title>Bioinformatic analysis</title><p>Protein alignments were performed using ClustalW in the MEGA7 software package [<xref rid="CIT0033">33</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0034">34</xref>].

Macrophages were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 1 mg/mL fluorescent brightener 28 (calcofluor, CAL) to observe fungal cell walls. Mounted coverslips were examined using differential interference contrast (DIC) and epifluorescence optics for cell wall staining and viewed on a Reichart Jung Polyvar II microscope. Images were captured using a SPOT CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc) and processed in Adobe Photoshop. The numbers of ungerminated conidia, germlings or yeast cells were recorded in a population of approximately 100 macrophages in three independent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="S0004-S2005"><title>Protein extraction and western blot analysis</title><p>The macrophage infection assay was performed as previously described (46). Briefly, J774 murine macrophages were seeded at 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL in a flask containing Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) and grown for 2 days. Macrophages were activated with 0.1 &#x003bc;g/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS), incubated for 24 h and infected with 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> conidia of <italic>T. marneffei</italic>. After 2 h the unphagocytosed conidia were washed off, fresh DMEM added and incubated for an additional 24 h. The media was removed and RIPA buffer (10mM Tris, pH7.4, 100mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS and 0.5% deoxycholate) containing cOmplete<sup>TM</sup> Protease Inhibitor (Roche) and 1mM PMSF, was added to lyse the macrophages. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 2000xg and the pellet predominantly consisting of <italic>T. marneffei</italic> yeast cells was separated from the J774 macrophage protein supernatant. <italic>T. marneffei</italic> cells were homogenized in a FastPrep&#x000ae;-24. Approximately 15 &#x003bc;g of each protein extract, as determined by Bradford assay, was used for SDS-PAGE. Western blot transfer was performed using Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) filters (Merck Millipore Ltd). The mCherry-tagged protein was detected using an anti-mCherry monoclonal rat primary antibody (ThermoFisher Scientific) and an anti-rat IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). HRP activity was detected using Clarity<sup>TM</sup> Western enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) substrate (Bio-Rad) on a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc<sup>TM</sup> MP imaging system.</p></sec><sec id="S0004-S2006"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Immunofluorescence localization of the mCherry-tagged strains was performed with an anti-mCherry rat monoclonal primary (Life Technologies) and a goat anti-rat ALEXA 488 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) using standard protocols [<xref rid="CIT0048">48</xref>]. Immunofluorescence microscopy controls using only primary or secondary antibodies as well as an untagged strain were performed to confirm the specificity of the antibodies.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank Prof. M.
