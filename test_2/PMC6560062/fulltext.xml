Until the techniques to target transgenes to safe harbor sites in the genome become routine, flanking transgenes with genetic insulators, DNA sequences that create independent domains of gene expression, can help avoid positional effects and stabilize their expression. We have, for the first time, compared the effect of three insulator sequences previously described in the literature and one never tested before. Our results indicate that their use increases transgene expression, but only the last one reduces variability between lines and between individuals. We have analyzed the integration of insulator-flanked T-DNAs using whole genome re-sequencing (to our knowledge, also for the first time) and found data suggesting that chiMARs can shelter transgene insertions from neighboring repressive epigenetic states. Finally, we could also observe a loss of accuracy of the RB insertion in the lines harboring insulators, evidenced by a high frequency of truncation of T-DNAs and of insertion of vector backbone that, however, did not affect transgene expression. Our data supports that the effect of each genetic insulator is different and their use in transgenic constructs should depend on the needs of each specific experiment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Molecular engineering in plants</kwd><kwd>Reporter genes</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Econom&#x00026;amp;#x00ED;a y Competitividad (Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BIO2014-58789-P</award-id><award-id>RYC-2012-10367</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Caro</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Due to the random nature of transgene insertion in the majority of higher eukaryotes, transgenic DNA may integrate into regions of the genome that are transcriptionally repressed (heterochromatin), which can result in many cases in transgene silencing. Additionally, transgenes may be incorporated near endogenous regulatory elements, such as transcriptional enhancers or repressors, which can cause their miss-expression (reviewed by<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>).</p><p id="Par3">Chromatin insulator sequences, or boundary elements, are DNA sequences with the capacity to define a chromatin domain because of two key activities, the first is the ability to interfere with enhancer-promoter communication when placed between the two (enhancer blocking activity) and the second one is the ability to protect a flanked transgene from position-dependent silencing (barrier activity)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">These boundary&#x000a0;elements have been characterized extensively in animals. In plants, possibly the best studied elements with potential applications are scaffold or matrix attachment regions (S/MARs), which have been suggested to trigger the formation of chromatin loops, and thus delimit the boundaries of discrete chromosomal domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Much of the research carried out concerning the use of transgene-flanking MARs as genetic insulators has shown that the use of these elements often results in an increase in the level of transgene expression and/or a reduction in plant-to-plant variability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">One of the most studied MARs is the one localized upstream the chicken lysozyme gene (chiMARs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Its role as insulator was shown in studies with animal cell lines where its presence near a reporter gene produced an increase in transgene expression and a decrease in variability among different lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The use of the chiMARs in plant constructs has been somehow controversial, leading to reports with different conclusions. The chicken sequence was shown to be able to bind to the tobacco nuclear matrix and that when it flanked a T-DNA containing a GUS reporter gene, the variability of its expression decreased in full-grown primary transformants of tobacco<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The same group later found that a significant reduction in variation of gene expression was conferred upon the GUS gene driven by the double cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, but not to the NPTII gene, driven by the nopaline synthase (pNOS) promoter, also in tobacco<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. These results could, however, not be replicated in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> first generation plants, where the chiMARs was found to have no influence on the level or variability of expression of transgenes driven by the 35S promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In fact, later studies applying different transformation methods reported no boost effect on transgene expression of Arabidopsis wild type plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, but an increase in silencing mutant backgrounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In 1996<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, it was shown that stably transformed tobacco cell lines in which a GUS reporter gene was flanked by the tobacco MAR isolated from a genomic clone containing a root specific gene (Rb7)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> produced more than 140 times more GUS enzyme activity than control transformants without it. However, the use of Rb7 did not reduce variation between different transformants.</p><p id="Par7">The effect of the Rb7 MAR increasing transgene expression on tobacco cell lines was also reported in 2003<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, that analyzed in depth the specificity of the results depending on the promoter used. They reported that highly active promoters exhibited significant increases in GUS activity in constructs flanked by Rb7 compared to controls, but its presence did not significantly increase GUS activity when driven by weak promoters. Importantly, most transgenes flanked by the insulator showed a large reduction in the number of low expressing GUS transformants, suggesting that MARs can reduce the frequency of gene silencing.</p><p id="Par8">Following that line, the effects of Rb7 were tested in conjunction with regulated transcription using a doxycycline-inducible luciferase transgene within tobacco cell cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The Rb7 lines showed higher reporter gene expression levels and avoided silencing apparition in the absence of active transcription from condensed chromatin spreading.</p><p id="Par9">Another well characterized genetic insulator, defined initially by its ability to block interactions between enhancers and promoters when positioned between them, is the petunia transformation boost sequence (TBS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This sequence has been shown to function in Arabidopsis and tobacco plants, and a detailed analysis of the motifs it contains showed that several specific regions are required for maximum enhancer-blocking function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">It was only a few years ago that another work showed that the TBS could similarly function in synthetic constructs sheltering transgenes promoters from the host plant genome regulatory elements. The TBS sequence was found to produce enhanced transgene expression in tobacco plants, but did not prevent gene silencing in transformants with multiple and rearranged gene copies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">It has been almost 25 years since the description of the first insulators and new examples are still being discovered nowadays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, but their use is not common practice in plant genetic engineering. This is in part due to the trouble that cloning them through traditional methods entails, and because the reports on their effects are scattered over different systems, organisms and transformation methods that do not allow for a clear comparison between them.</p><p id="Par12">Targeting transgenes to a specific integration site in the plant genome might reduce chromosomal position effects, but until there are routine efficient techniques for directed gene targeting&#x000a0;in plants, another alternative method needs to be developed for that purpose.</p><p id="Par13">With the advent of modular cloning techniques that allow rapid and straight forward generation of multigene constructs, the incorporation of genetic insulators to the flanks of T-DNAs is no longer a problem. Therefore, we decided to perform a systematic and parallel study comparing the activity and effectivity of incorporating different boundary elements flanking transgenes as a strategy in T-DNA design to maximize and stabilize transgene expression. We have, moreover, used whole genome re-sequencing for the molecular characterization of the insertion of insulator-flanked T-DNAs, finding interesting results that point to previously unknown functions of the barrier sequences.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Modular cloning</title><p id="Par14">Modular pieces AtS/MAR10 and Rb7 were amplified by PCR using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB) from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>N. tabacum</italic> genomic DNA using primers 359/348 and 269/270, respectively; chiMARs and TBS were amplified using KAPA2G Fast HotStart DNA Polymerase (Sigma) from chicken liver tissue and <italic>P. hybrida</italic> genomic DNA using primers 1724/1725/1726/1727 and 275/276/277/278, respectively (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>List of primers used.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>1724</td><td>GCGCCGTCTCGCTCGGGAGGCTCAGAAAACGGCAGTTGG</td></tr><tr><td>1725</td><td>GCGCCGTCTCGACCGCTCTAGGAAATTTAAGG</td></tr><tr><td>1726</td><td>GCGCCGTCTCGCGGTGCTCAGTAAGGCGGGT</td></tr><tr><td>1727</td><td>GCGCCGTCTCGCTCGAGCGCACACCAGAGCCTACACCTG</td></tr><tr><td>275</td><td>GCGCCGTCTCGCTCGGGAGTTCCTAACACCTGGAGAACC</td></tr><tr><td>276</td><td>GCGCCGTCTCGGCGACCAAAGTGTGCAGGCT</td></tr><tr><td>277</td><td>GCGCCGTCTCGTCGCCCCTTGGCTGTGAAAA</td></tr><tr><td>278</td><td>GCGCCGTCTCGCTCGAGCGAAGTTGTAATGAGTTGCTGGC</td></tr><tr><td>359</td><td>GCGCCGTCTCGCTCGGGAGTGGCTATTGTTGTTATCATCA</td></tr><tr><td>348</td><td>GCGCCGTCTCGCTCAAGCGGGGTTTAGCCATTAACATCGT</td></tr><tr><td>269</td><td>GCGCCGTCTCGCTCGGGAGTCGATTAAAAATCCCAATTATATTTGG</td></tr><tr><td>270</td><td>GCGCCGTCTCGCTCGAGCGACTATTTTCAGAAGAAGTTCCCAA</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par15">Modular pieces were cloned into pFranki (chiMARs and TBS) or into GoldenBraid pUPD2 (Rb7 and AtS/MAR10) vectors, as described in (Sarrion-Perdigones <italic>et al</italic>., 2011)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. pFranki is a home-made vector adapted to clone pieces originally designed for GB2.0 so they can be compatible with GB3.0 and MoClo cloning systems. pFranki vector is composed by the cloning cassette of the GoldenBraid pUPD vector and the backbone of the pUPD2 vector.

For Rb7, chiMARs and TBS, the increase in expression induced was not homogeneous between individuals and, as a result, there was a greater variance in these lines compared to the control. For AtS/MAR10, there was a small variance, similar to that of the control with no insulator (CV around 25%) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>).</p><p id="Par28">Next, we compared LUC expression in segregating lines from the T2 generation with homozygous lines from the T3 generation, in an effort to establish if, in our system in study, LUC expression was dependent on gene dosage. Our experiments confirm an increase in expression in all T3 lines compared to T2, consistent with the establishment of homozygous populations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). Rb7 and AtS/MAR10 lines were the ones where expression increased most in the transition to T3 (T2/T3 expression ratio of 4.1 and 5.5 respectively versus 2.5 of Control, 1.8 of chiMARs and 3.1 of TBS).</p><p id="Par29">In an effort to further characterize the insulator lines in more detail than previous works, we proceeded to perform whole genome re-sequencing (WGR) in some of the lines obtained by transformation with each construct (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). The results allowed us to select 21 lines with a single T-DNA insertion locus. Even though all the lines showed a 3:1 Basta resistance segregation in the T2, we found three T3 lines in which there were multiple insertions in different chromosomes, suggesting that some of them were not leading to proper transgene expression. An interesting finding was that AtS/MAR10 40.01, the outlier line that showed abnormally high LUC expression, had two insertions in the same region of chromosome 1, what could explain its&#x000a0;behavior as a single locus in our segregation analysis and the reported increased transgene expression. The WGR data also allowed us to map the T-DNA insertion site of each line and to identify the deletions in the host genome associated with the insertion (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Surprisingly, integration was not homogeneous among all chromosomes (we found none of the mapped insertions to be located in chromosome 2), and for Rb7 lines there was a clear preference for insertion within chromosome 3 (60%, 3 out of 5 lines) and with the T-DNA in the 3&#x02032;-&#x0003e;5&#x02032; direction (100%, 5 out of 5 lines), while for the rest of the lines chromosome 3 integrations and reverse T-DNA insertions only represented a 31% in each case (5 out of 16 for each) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Analysis of insulator effect over T-DNA insertion.

The experiments were, however, very diverse in terms of species (some experiments had been done in tobacco and others in Arabidopsis) and in terms of method of transformation (some performed in primary transformants after regeneration and some in floral-dipped Arabidopsis).</p><p id="Par34">It was an important motivation for the present&#x000a0;study to compare the effects of the different isolators in the same conditions: organism, developmental stage and transformation method. Our results do in fact support most results from literature, since we detect an increase in expression for lines where LUC is flanked by any of the four insulators, and previous negative results could reflect a dependency of the function of insulators on the experimental conditions.</p><p id="Par35">Noteworthy, the use of AtS/MAR10, that had never been tested before for insulator activity, resulted in a moderate but very consistent increase in LUC expression.</p><p id="Par36">In our hands, neither chiMARs, Rb7 nor TBS had an effect on reducing inter-line or inter-individual variation, in fact they increased them significantly. However, previous studies on the effect of chiMARs had highlighted its effect on the reduction of expression variability among transgenic lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. This inconsistence could derive from a few factors in which our study differs basically from these other works. First, in our system we have used the pMAS promoter (versus the p35S used by Mlynarova <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>) which never reaches such high levels of expression as the p35S, but that results in normally distributed expression levels in populations of transformants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. It might be possible that the chiMARs works reducing the variance of strong promoters but its effect is not so apparent in promoters with an intrinsically low level of variation such as pMAS, like Mankin <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> described for Rb7. Second, in our study we have analyzed expression in homozygous T3 lines, that are already established lines with low variance in comparison with the T1 transformants analyzed by Mlynarova <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. It is interesting to note that the levels of variability between lines in the LUC control are in the same range as the variability between genetically identical individuals (around 30%), supporting the consistency and small intrinsic variance of our experimental set up in which we analyze T3.</p><p id="Par37">In fact, it is striking that AtS/MAR10 is able to diminish inter-line variance, proving efficient in modifying both of the parameters measured, increasing transgene expression and reducing variability between lines, what makes it the best performing of the insulators analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Effect of insulators on T-DNA insertion</title><p id="Par38">Two interesting observations have been made regarding the effect of insulators on the insertion of T-DNAs. On the one hand, it is reported that T-DNA integrations recovered by selection are mostly located in &#x0201c;open chromatin&#x0201d; or euchromatin, while, without selection, integration is biased towards regions with marks of heterochromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. This is explained by the silencing of the selection genes when integration takes place within heterochromatin, a phenomenon that prevents transformant recovery. Our results show the ability of chiMAR to shelter T-DNAs from heterochromatin spreading and to allow for transgene expression regardless of the position effect.</p><p id="Par39">On the other hand, the observation of an increased frequency of truncated T-DNAs in the lines containing insulators had been reported before by Li <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Our results can be interpreted in the light of a role of insulators in the protection of transgenes at the right border end of the T-DNA from deletions. This would also explain the low correlation of expression between reporter genes located within the same T-DNA observed in many previous studies, and shown to improve by the use of insulators flanking them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par40">An in silico analysis of the insulators sequences using NonB DB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> showed that the 5&#x02032; region of the AtS/MAR10 contains an inverted repeat and a mirror repeat rich in purines, features that lead to the formation of cruciform and triplex structures, respectively, which have been associated with genomic instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Future experiments could be directed at understanding the role of these repeats in the insertion of truncated T-DNAs or vector backbone in constructs harboring AtS/MAR10.</p><p id="Par41">As a general conclusion, we can state that there are many different insulators described in the literature with very different properties. Their functions might reflect differences in their action mechanisms and their use in transgenic constructs should depend on the needs of a specific experiment.</p><p id="Par42">In our experimental setup, the best performing insulators were Rb7 in terms of increase of transgene expression, and AtS/MAR10 in terms of reducing variance.</p><p id="Par43">Plant biologists should invest more efforts in the development of technologies that can render transgenes with high and stable expression with rapidity and ease. The future of synthetic biology and biotechnology projects depends on our ability to stabilize transgene expression and alleviate interference with the host genome regulation. In this work we show that the use of genetic insulators can help achieve these objectives with their simple addition at the flanks of the constructs used for transformation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec13"><p>
