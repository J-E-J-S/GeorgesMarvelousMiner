In type III CRISPR systems, an effector complex programmed by CRISPR RNA detects invading RNA, triggering a multi-layered defence that includes target RNA cleavage, licencing of an HD DNA nuclease domain and synthesis of cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) molecules. cOA activates the Csx1/Csm6 family of effectors, which degrade RNA non-specifically to enhance immunity. Type III systems are found in diverse archaea and bacteria, including the human pathogen <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> activities of the type III-A <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> CRISPR system. We demonstrate that immunity against MGE may be achieved predominantly via a cyclic hexa-adenylate (cA6) signalling pathway and the ribonuclease Csm6, rather than through DNA cleavage by the HD domain. Furthermore, we show for the first time that a type III CRISPR system can be reprogrammed by replacing the effector protein, which may be relevant for maintenance of immunity in response to pressure from viral anti-CRISPRs. These observations demonstrate that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> has a fully-functioning CRISPR interference system that generates a range of cyclic and linear oligonucleotides of known and unknown functions, potentiating fundamental and applied studies.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Royal Society</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100000288</named-content></funding-source><award-id>CH160014</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100000268</named-content></funding-source><award-id>BB/S000313/1</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The CRISPR system provides adaptive immunity against mobile genetic elements (MGE) in prokaryotes (reviewed in (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)). CRISPR systems are classified into two major classes and six major types: class 1 (types I, III and IV) have multi-subunit effector complexes based around a Cas7 backbone subunit, whilst class 2 (types II, V and VI) are single-subunit enzymes (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The latter, encompassing Cas9, Cas12 and Cas13, have shown great utility in genome engineering applications due to their relative simplicity. However, class 1 systems are more widespread in prokaryotes. Type III effector systems are arguably the most complex, powerful and versatile of the characterized CRISPR interference complexes. Assembled around a Cas7 backbone that binds CRISPR RNA (crRNA) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), they act as surveillance complexes in the cell, detecting target RNA molecules from MGE via base-pairing to the crRNA. Target RNA binding licenses the HD-nuclease domain of the Cas10 subunit to degrade single-stranded DNA, providing a mechanism for co-transcriptional target DNA degradation (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;10</xref>). In addition, the Cyclase/Palm domain of Cas10 is activated for synthesis of cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref>). cOA, which is assembled from 3&#x02013;6 AMP monomers to generate species from cA<sub>3</sub> to cA<sub>6</sub>, is a potent second messenger that in turn binds to downstream effector complexes via a CRISPR Associated Rossman Fold (CARF) domain (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Diverse proteins with CARF domains have been identified computationally, but only one family has been studied extensively: the Csx1/Csm6 family that utilizes a C-terminal HEPN (Higher Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes, Nucleotide binding) domain to cleave RNA (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). These enzymes are important for CRISPR-based immunity <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref>).Thus, type III CRISPR systems are capable of directing a multi-faceted antiviral defence on detection of foreign RNA in the cell (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The CRISPR system of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>.

<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), which imposes a huge burden on human health and on developing economies, with 10 million new infections and 1.6 million deaths in 2017 (WHO Global Tuberculosis Report, 2018). The majority of <italic>Mtb</italic> strains encode a complete CRISPR system (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), and indeed the type III-A (or Csm) CRISPR system was originally labelled as the &#x02018;Mtube&#x02019; subtype based on the genes present in <italic>Mtb</italic> strain H37Rv (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). CRISPR loci vary between <italic>Mtb</italic> strains and have been used for many years as a strain typing (spoligotyping) tool (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), suggesting uptake of DNA derived from mycobacteriophage or other MGE by the CRISPR system occurs. The type III-A system encoded by <italic>Mtb</italic> H37Rv comprises Csm1&#x02013;6, with Cas6 for crRNA processing and the adaptation proteins Cas1 and Cas2 next to the CRISPR array (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> (BCG), the organization is identical with the exception of a truncating mutation in the <italic>csm6</italic> gene (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).

This is surprising given the importance of <italic>Mtb</italic> as a human pathogen and the relative lack of model type III CRISPR systems outwith the hyperthermophiles. We took the initial approach of expressing synthetic genes encoding Csm1&#x02013;5 individually in <italic>E. coli</italic> using the expression vector pEhisV5Tev (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Most of the subunits were expressed strongly, but the Csm2 (Cas11) subunit was completely insoluble under all induction conditions tested. We also expressed the <italic>Mtb</italic> Csm6 and Cas6 enzymes in soluble form (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Cas6 was observed to cleave a CRISPR RNA substrate to generate the expected 8 nt 5&#x02032;-handle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). This activity was stimulated by the addition of a divalent cation, as observed previously (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, the ability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to support catalysis is suggestive of a role for the metal ion in RNA folding and stability rather than a direct role in the catalytic mechanism, and all other Cas6 enzymes studied are metal-independent enzymes (reviewed in (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>)).</p><p>We next constructed a plasmid to express all five subunits of <italic>Mtb</italic> Csm simultaneously using the MultiColi&#x02122;&#x000a0;system (Geneva Biotech), along with a compatible pCDFDuet-1 derivative expressing an <italic>Mtb</italic> mini-CRISPR and the Cas6 enzyme (pCRISPR, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) to allow for co-production of the crRNA-charged interference complex in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Using a polyhistidine tag on the Csm4 (Cas5) subunit, it was noted that all subunits except Csm2 could be identified. Coupled with the observation that Csm2 was insoluble in isolation, we hypothesized that heterologous expression of this subunit was a barrier to successful expression of the Csm complex. We therefore added a gene encoding the Csm2 homologue from <italic>Mycobacterium canettii</italic> (<italic>Mca</italic>) to the Csm expression vector (pCsm1&#x02013;5, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The two proteins are 71% identical at the amino acid level. Gratifyingly, the Csm complex could then be purified using affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Mass spectrometry confirmed that all subunits were present. In all subsequent Csm expression plasmids, the <italic>Mtb csm2</italic> gene was therefore replaced by <italic>Mca csm2</italic>. Protein expression plasmids were also constructed carrying site directed mutations targeted to the active sites of the Csm complex: a Cyclase (Cy) variant (GGDD to GGAA, pCsm1&#x02013;5_Cy) and a Csm3 D35A variant (C3, pCsm1&#x02013;5_C3, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), as described in the methods. The variant interference complexes were expressed and purified as described for the wild-type (WT).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-2"><title>Target RNA and DNA cleavage by <italic>Mtb</italic> Csm</title><p>The CRISPR array used in heterologous production of the Csm effector complex contained two copies of the same artificial spacer to minimize heterogeneity. We first evaluated the ability of Csm to cleave target RNA that was complementary to the crRNA. Incubation of Csm effector complex with 5&#x02032;-radiolabelled target RNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>&#x000a0;and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>) in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> resulted in five cleavage products (B1&#x02013;B5) with the characteristic 6 nt spacing, consistent with other type III effectors (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29&#x02013;32</xref>). This suggests that 5 Cas7 subunits are present in the complex, although we have not determined the subunit stoichiometry definitively and it will likely vary with crRNA length. Non-complementary RNA was not cleaved by the effector complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>); however, anti-tag RNA with full-length complementarity to the crRNA (including 5&#x02032;-handle), that mimics antisense RNA derived from the CRISPR locus, produced the same cleavage pattern as observed for target RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>). A variant Csm complex with a mutation targeted to the cyclase domain (Cy) was indistinguishable from the WT protein for RNA cleavage. However, a variant (C3) with the Csm3 (Cas7) D35A mutation was not competent for target RNA cleavage, as expected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). We also investigated DNA cleavage by the <italic>Mtb</italic> Csm effector complex. We observed weak cleavage of ssDNA substrates by the WT complex; however, a variant with a mutation in the HD nuclease domain was still capable of degrading ssDNA, whilst the Csm3 D35A variant showed no DNase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). No detectable hydrolysis was observed for DNA bubbles or dsDNA and the observed DNase activity was not dependent on the presence of target RNA. Together, these data suggest there is no functional HD nuclease activity in the recombinant <italic>Mtb</italic> Csm complex <italic>in vitro</italic>.

A candidate Csx1 protein from the gammaproteobacterium <italic>Thioalkalivibrio sulfidiphilus</italic> (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) was selected and expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> from a synthetic gene. The activity of the purified recombinant protein (TsuCsx1) was tested against a labelled RNA substrate in the absence and presence of cOA species (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). TsuCsx1 was strongly activated by synthetic cA<sub>4</sub> but not by cA<sub>6</sub>, demonstrating that this enzyme is cA<sub>4</sub> specific. Strong activation was also observed when the enzyme was incubated with cOA generated by the <italic>Mtb</italic> Csm complex, consistent with the observation that cA<sub>4</sub> is a significant component of this mixture (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Re-programming the <italic>Mtb</italic> Csm system for cA<sub>4</sub>-responsive immunity.

<italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> harbours the archetypal type III-A (&#x02018;Mtube&#x02019;) CRISPR system, and the variability of CRISPR loci in mycobacteria (spoligotyping) has been utilized to classify isolates for over 20 years. Despite this, little has been reported on the characterization of the <italic>Mtb</italic> CRISPR system, particularly <italic>in vitro</italic>. Initial work on reconstituting the <italic>Mtb</italic> Csm complex in <italic>E. coli</italic> encountered problems due to poor solubility of the Csm2 (Cas11) subunit. We surmounted this hurdle by swapping the problematic <italic>Mtb csm2</italic> gene with that from the closely related species <italic>Mycobacterium cannetti</italic>, allowing expression of <italic>Mtb</italic> Csm complex that is functional both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Such an approach may find utility in other circumstances when studying multi-protein complexes.</p><p>Having succeeded in constructing an active <italic>Mtb</italic> Csm complex, we could dissect the contributions of the various enzymatic activities of this complex to CRISPR-based immunity. We could detect no strong evidence for target RNA dependent DNA cleavage by the HD nuclease domain of the <italic>Mtb</italic> Csm complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Furthermore, targeted mutation of the HD nuclease active site did not affect the ability of the <italic>Mtb</italic> CRISPR system to provide immunity against plasmid transformation in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and immunity was lost when the Cyclase active site was inactivated and the HD nuclease unaffected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Target RNA dependent DNA cleavage by the HD nuclease domain of Cas10 has been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> for the type III-A complexes of <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), <italic>Streptococcus thermophilus</italic> (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), and type III-B complexes of <italic>Thermatoga maritima</italic> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and <italic>Sulfolobus islandicus</italic>&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). On the other hand, not all type III CRISPR effectors support robust DNase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), and not all type III systems have an intact HD nuclease domain (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). HD nuclease activity is often not required for plasmid immunity <italic>in vivo</italic>, although the cyclase activity of Cas10 and the presence of a cOA effector nuclease clearly is (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref>). Recent analysis of plasmid clearance by the type III-A system of <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> revealed that highly transcribed plasmid targets were cleared efficiently by DNA targeting, whilst low levels of transcription resulted in a requirement for RNA cleavage by the Csm6 nuclease. This suggests that these two aspects of type III defence systems can work in tandem, and assume differing importance for immunity, depending on the biology of the invading genetic element (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Although we see no target-activated role for the HD nuclease domain of <italic>Mtb</italic> Csm, either <italic>in vitro</italic> or in <italic>E. coli</italic>, we cannot rule out a role <italic>in vivo</italic> in the homologous host. It is possible that the recombinant system generated here has resulted in deactivation of the HD nuclease, for example, or that a missing component is crucial for full function in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p><p>Cyclic oligoadenylate synthesis has been studied for a variety of type III CRISPR systems. One emerging paradigm is that a range of cOA molecules, from cA<sub>3</sub> to cA<sub>6</sub>, are synthesized&#x02014;at least for recombinant systems <italic>in vitro</italic>. We observed a predominance of the smaller species for WT <italic>Mtb</italic> Csm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), consistent with observations for the type III-A complex from <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Notably, when target RNA cleavage was abolished by introduction of a D35A mutation in the Csm3 subunit, the levels and distribution of cOA species changed dramatically. A significant increase in the amounts of the larger cA<sub>6</sub> and cA<sub>5</sub> species was observed, with cA<sub>6</sub> coming to predominate. This reflects the finding that target RNA cleavage by the Csm3 subunit is the event that deactivates the cyclase domain (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). However, even with target RNA cleavage abolished, a range of cOA species are synthesized. This leads to the question: is this a feature or a bug? Or in other words, has the ability to generate a range of cOA species been selected for by evolution, or just not selected against?</p></sec><sec id="SEC4-2"><title>Ancillary defence enzymes are replaceable parts for Type III CRISPR systems</title><p>A number of Csx1/Csm6 family proteins have now been studied structurally and/or biochemically (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). As already noted, proteins in this family have an N-terminal CARF domain and a C-terminal HEPN domain. They tend to be named as &#x02018;Csm6&#x02019; proteins if their genes are closely associated with those encoding a type III-A/Csm CRISPR effector complex, and Csx1 proteins if they are not, but it is not clear that this division relates to any intrinsic property or sequence of family members. The enzymes from the Archaeal, Deinococcus-Thermus and Proteobacterial phlya that have been studied to date all utilize cA<sub>4</sub> as an activator (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), with examples of cA<sub>6</sub>-dependent enzymes only characterized so far in the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. As cA<sub>4</sub> and cA<sub>6</sub> have quite significantly different structures and sizes, this is likely to be reflected in the structures of the corresponding CARF domains that bind these ligands. To date however, there is no structural information available for any cA<sub>6</sub>-binding CARF domain&#x02014;this is a priority for future studies.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Comparison of characterized Csx1/Csm6 family proteins</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Species</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phylum</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gene</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">CRISPR subtype</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">PDB</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">cOA activator</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Although only type III-A systems are known to utilize cA<sub>6</sub>, there are well-studied examples (such as <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> and <italic>Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus</italic>) of type III-A systems with ancillary ribonucleases activated by cA<sub>4</sub>. All type III systems studied to date have the capability of making a range of cyclic oligoadenylates from cA<sub>3</sub>-cA<sub>6</sub> (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). As we have shown here, the immunity provided by a type III system can be readily converted from a cA<sub>6</sub> to a cA<sub>4</sub>-based mechanism, simply by replacing the ancillary enzyme. This suggests there is no direct cross-talk between the type III complex and the ribonuclease, other than via the cOA activator. Given the extent of gene loss and gain in CRISPR loci, the capture of a new CARF-family effector protein might be sufficient to potentiate a switch from one cOA signalling molecule to another. It is equally possible that distinct effector proteins, activated by cA<sub>4</sub> and cA<sub>6</sub>, could operate in parallel in a single host species. This could provide enhanced levels of immunity by supporting multiple ancillary defence proteins, many of which remain uncharacterized so far. Furthermore, the ability to switch between reliance on cA<sub>4</sub> or cA<sub>6</sub> could be an effective mechanism to maintain immunity in response to (putative) viral anti-CRISPRs which disrupt the cOA signalling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="SEC4-3"><title>Cyclic and linear oligoadenylate signalling&#x02014;more to discover?</title><p>Another pressing question for type III CRISPR systems concerns the role (if any) for cA<sub>3</sub> molecules, which are often the most abundant species synthesized, at least <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Given the lack of 2-fold symmetry for cA<sub>3</sub>, recognition of this molecule may be accomplished by a sensing domain quite distinct from the dimeric CARF domain found in many CRISPR-associated proteins (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Recent discoveries of novel cyclic trinucleotides synthesiszed by bacterial cGAS-like enzymes and detected by vertebrate innate immune surveillance proteins (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) make this question pertinent. This is particularly true for organisms such as <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, which has an intracellular lifestyle in vertebrate hosts with which it participates in a two-way communication via cyclic nucleotides (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Furthermore, the significant quantities of nanoRNAs (eg A<sub>3</sub>-triphosphate) synthesized by the Csm complex should not be discounted as dead-end side products. NanoRNAs have been shown capable of priming transcription initiation in bacteria (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Recently, the CnpB (Rv2837c) protein, which can degrade nanoRNAs, controls the transcription of the <italic>csm</italic> genes and CRISPR RNA in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Deletion of the <italic>cnpB</italic> gene leads to massive transcriptional upregulation of the <italic>csm</italic> genes, which is consistent with a model whereby nanoRNAs generated by the Csm cyclase domain play a role in sculpting the transcriptional response to phage infection in cells with a type III CRISPR system by activating defence gene expression. Clearly, there are still many avenues to explore.</p><p>Finally, there is the requirement to re-set the cell to a ground-state when infection has been cleared, which probably requires degradation of the cOA generated during infection. Specialized &#x02018;ring nucleases&#x02019; that degrade cA<sub>4</sub> have been identified in archaea (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), and recent work has shown that Csm6 enzymes can also slowly degrade cA<sub>4</sub> in their CARF domain, acting as self-limiting ribonucleases (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). There is no published evidence yet for cA<sub>6</sub> degradation enzymes, but the most obvious candidates are the CARF domains of Csm6 family proteins. Alternatively, given the larger size and increased flexibility of cA<sub>6</sub> compared to cA<sub>4</sub>, the former may be degraded effectively by promiscuous ribonucleases in the cell.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>gkz676_Supplemental_File</label><media xlink:href="gkz676_supplemental_file.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ACK1"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>Thanks to Christophe Rouillon, Marialena Varympopioti and Chloe Jones for helpful discussions.</p></ack><sec id="SEC5"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>
