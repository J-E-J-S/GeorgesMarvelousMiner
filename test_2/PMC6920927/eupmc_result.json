    "The study of yeast biodiversity represents an important step in the preservation of the local heritage, and this work in particular has an innovative character since no further studies have investigated 'Merwah', one of the main grape varieties used in winemaking in Lebanon. To gain deeper knowledge of the genetic diversity and population structure of native Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine strains, 202 isolates were collected during spontaneous alcoholic fermentation of eight must/wine samples of cultivar 'Merwah', over two consecutive years (2016, 2017) in a traditional winery in Mount Lebanon (1400 m a.s.l.). The isolates were identified as S. cerevisiae on the basis of their morphology and preliminary sequence analysis of their internal transcribed spacer (ITS) PCR. They were then characterised at the strain level by interdelta PCR and genotyped using multiplex PCR reactions of 12 microsatellite markers. High genetic diversity was observed for the studied population. To select potential yeast starter strains from this population, micro-fermentations were carried out for 22 S. cerevisiae strains that were selected as representative of the 'Merwah' wine yeast population in order to determine their technological and oenological properties. Three indigenous yeast strains might represent candidates for pilot-scale fermentation in the winery, based on relevant features such as high fermentation vigour, low production of volatile acidity and H2S and low residual sugar content at the end of alcoholic fermentation."
