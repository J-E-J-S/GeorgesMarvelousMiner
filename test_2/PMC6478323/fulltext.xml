Due to their unique characteristics, magnetite magnetosomes are promising tools in Biomedicine. However, the uptake, persistence, and accumulation of magnetosomes within mammalian cells have not been well studied. Here, the endocytic pathway of magnetite magnetosomes and their effects on human cervix epithelial (HeLa) cells were studied by electron microscopy and high spatial resolution nano-analysis techniques. Transmission electron microscopy of HeLa cells after incubation with purified magnetosomes showed the presence of magnetic nanoparticles inside or outside endosomes within the cell, which suggests different modes of internalization, and that these structures persisted beyond 120 h after internalization. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectra of internalized magnetosome crystals showed no structural or chemical changes in these structures. Although crystal morphology was preserved, iron oxide crystalline particles of approximately 5 nm near internalized magnetosomes suggests that minor degradation of the original mineral structures might occur. Cytotoxicity and microscopy analysis showed that magnetosomes did not result in any apparent effect on HeLa cells viability or morphology. Based on our results, magnetosomes have significant biocompatibility with mammalian cells and thus have great potential in medical, biotechnological applications.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecnol&#x000f3;gico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004586</institution-id><institution>Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002322</institution-id><institution>Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel Superior</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Finance Code 001</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EAR-1423939</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bazylinski</surname><given-names>Dennis A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq), the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES), and the Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support in the State of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ).

Magnetosomes biomineralized by magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) possess many attributes that make them suitable for biotechnological applications [<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Among these attributes are the high chemical purity of the magnetic mineral, well-defined crystals morphologies, narrow size range in nanometric scale, dimensions consistent with single magnetic domains and the presence of a phospholipid bilayer surrounding each crystal. Therefore, studies involving cell-magnetosomes interactions are potentially relevant for nanobiotechnology and medicine [<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Several applications using bacterial magnetosomes have been proposed and are currently under investigation for medical diagnosis including magnetic resonance imaging contrast, drug delivery, magnetic fluid hyperthermia therapy, and DNA extraction techniques [<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Many of these applications are well described and documented, showing the advantages of using bacterial magnetosomes over synthetic magnetic nanocrystals [<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For example, magnetosomes appear to be more effective in generating heat in magnetic fluid hyperthermia than synthetic magnetic crystals, probably due to the optimum particle size and stable magnetic properties [<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, because of the presence of the membrane containing proteins in the structure of magnetosomes, they are more easily functionalized by bioconjugation techniques [<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Although some studies have investigated applications involving the use of bacterial magnetosomes in medicine, few considered or examined their cytotoxicity, accumulation, and localization in mammalian cells. Liu et al. (2012) simulated lysosome activity against magnetosomes and chemically-synthesized magnetic nanoparticles using bovine pancreas proteases <italic>in vitro</italic> and showed that after 28 days, magnetosome crystals dissolved into free soluble iron ions [<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. When accumulation and degradation of magnetic nanoparticles were studied <italic>in vivo</italic> in mice, both magnetosomes and synthetic particles were observed within endocytic vesicles in liver cells 14 days after the intravenous injection of both magnetic particles in the caudal vein of the mice [<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, only endocytic vesicles containing magnetosomes fused to lysosomes, suggesting that magnetosomes and artificial nanoparticles underwent different decomposition pathway [<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Other <italic>in vivo</italic> studies showed that the morphology of magnetosomes&#x02019; magnetite crystals was preserved after magnetosome injection in rats [<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In these cases, it was suggested that magnetosomes accumulated in the liver of organisms [<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] or were dissolved into free soluble iron ions or had their crystalline structure unaffected and were eliminated in feces or urine [<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>These studies are relevant and pioneer in the evaluation of the potential use of magnetosomes in humans for medical purposes. However, to date <italic>in vitro</italic> studies considering the cytotoxicity and the endocytic pathways of magnetosomes in human cell line models are scarce. Regardless of the medical application, magnetosomes should not lose their magnetic properties and structure during the period in which are being used as tools for drug delivery, hyperthermia or localization reporter of molecules or other structures. Therefore, we used conventional and high-resolution microscopy techniques to study the uptake and persistence of bacterial magnetosomes using HeLa cells as a model; the viability of HeLa cells after interaction with and uptake of magnetosomes; and possible modifications on the ultrastructure of the magnetosomes magnetite crystals after the internalization by HeLa cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cell cultures</title><p>HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, as recommended by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). <italic>Magnetovibrio blakemorei</italic> strain MV-1 was cultivated anaerobically in liquid medium with nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) and FeSO<sub>4</sub>&#x02022;6H<sub>2</sub>O (100 &#x003bc;M) as the major source of Fe according to Silva et al.

Treated cultures displayed dark areas corresponding to aggregates of magnetosomes; even in these areas, no inhibition of growth was detected. The cytotoxicity assay showed that magnetosomes did not have any toxic effect on cells in all incubation times analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215657.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Magnetosome cytotoxicity have already been evaluated against a few cell lines. In these studies, H22 (mouse hepatocarcinoma cells), HL60 (human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells), EMT-6 (mouse mammary cancer cells) and ARPE-19 cells (human retinal pigment epithelium cells) were treated with 9 &#x003bc;g/ml of magnetite magnetosomes for the three first cell lineages and 10, 50 and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml for ARPE-19 cells and no toxic effect was observed [<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Qi et al. (2016) showed that when the same amounts of synthetic magnetic particles were added to ARPE-19 cells (10, 50 and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml), their viability decreased significantly after incubation [<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This study also reported that cell viability rates were directly correlated to the concentration of the synthetic nanoparticles as well as the incubation period. Similar results were obtained for 661W cells (mouse transformed cell line) [<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, cell death was directly related to an increase in the concentration of synthetic magnetite nanoparticles incubated with cell cultures. On the other hand, the use of the same concentrations of magnetosomes promoted the growth of ARPE-19 cells [<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

Therefore, our findings are consistent with these previous studies, indicating high biocompatibility between magnetosomes and mammalian cells even when high concentrations of magnetosomes were used. In addition to the non-deleterious effect on cells, the presence of a biological membrane involving the magnetosome also make these magnetic nanoparticles excellent tools in nanomedicine, because of the possibility of associating molecules to proteins embedded on this outer phospholipidic bilayer.</p><fig id="pone.0215657.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0215657.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>TEM image of purified magnetosomes and phase contrast light microscopy images of HeLa cell culture.</title><p>A) Purified magnetosomes with surrounding membrane (inset shows the magnetosome membrane in detail; black arrowheads).

No toxic effect was detected and a slight growth of cells was observed when compared to control (percentages above 100%).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0215657.g001"/></fig><p>Ultrathin sections of HeLa cells after incubation with magnetosomes showed a large number of internalized particles in endosome vesicles apparently in different stages of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215657.g002">Fig 2A&#x02013;2E</xref>), confirming that magnetosomes crystals followed the endocytic pathway observed in other cell lineages [<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Interestingly, in this study, some magnetosomes were also detected in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215657.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). This observation has not been reported before and suggests that magnetosomes might have been taken up by the cell by different mechanisms. TEM showed that the membrane of magnetosomes was still present in magnetosomes located within endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215657.g002">Fig 2E</xref> inset; arrowheads), but absent from those found in the cytoplasm outside endocytic vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215657.g002">Fig 2F</xref> inset). The absence of the enveloping membrane on magnetic nanocrystals observed in the cytoplasm suggests that the membrane of these magnetosomes was removed from the crystal after endocytosis and the magnetic nanocrystal was transferred to the cytoplasm. The endosomal scape could be promoted by unknown endosomolytic agents present in the magnetosome. Magnetosomes, as well as their associated proteins, have never been tested for their endosomolytic potential, but this should probably opportune because of the benefits to the development of novel drug-delivery systems [<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Another possibility to explain the absence of membrane in magnetic nanoparticles within the cytoplasm is that some magnetosomes could have lost the membrane during the purification process and were guided to a different site within the cell. Eukaryotic cells promote endocytosis by different means that are dependent on the size of the particle(s) and the chemical properties of molecules on the structures that are being internalized [<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Because magnetosomes found &#x0201c;freely&#x0201d; in the cytoplasm were relatively low in number and the aggregates of particles, in this case, were at the nanometer scale, it is possible that a different mechanism was used to internalize single or a very small aggregates of magnetosomes. Magnetosomes in endocytic vesicles were probably engulfed by cells as aggregates of particles at the micrometer scale. In addition to this, the absence of the magnetosome membrane might have modified the chemical properties of the magnetosomes possibly also leading to this different mechanism of endocytosis, as previously mentioned.</p><fig id="pone.0215657.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0215657.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>TEM images of stained ultrathin sections of HeLa cells showing internalization of magnetite magnetosomes purified from <italic>M</italic>. <italic>blakemorei</italic> strain MV-1.</title><p>A) Magnetosomes at the surface of cells showing the first steps in endocytosis.

Size and shape factor of magnetite crystals in freshly purified magnetosomes and those in endocytic vesicles or the cytoplasm after internalization by HeLa cells showed no significant differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215657.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). HRTEM images of internalized magnetosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215657.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>) were consistent with the mineral magnetite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). Variations in the crystalline structure were not detected even in the nanocrystals without the membrane in the cytoplasm, indicating that magnetite magnetosomes were not promptly dissolved. Therefore, toxic effects would not be generated due to the dissolution of the crystals and the significant release of great amounts of soluble iron in the cell. From the observations above we can consider that both magnetosomes with and without a surrounding membrane are stable inside cells for a significantly long period, allowing us to glimpse new applications for their use such as localization of specific targets, controlled drug delivery, hyperthermia assays, enhancement of medical imaging, among others.</p><p>EELS mapping and spectra of the energy loss near edge structure (ELNES) of oxygen (O-K edge around 540 eV) and iron (Fe-L edge around 710 eV) were done in order to compare iron oxidation states on the bulk, near the border and outside the magnetosome in endosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215657.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>), cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215657.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>) and control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215657.g003">Fig 3G and 3H</xref>). According to EELS spectra, magnetosomes inside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215657.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) and outside endocytic vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215657.g003">Fig 3F</xref>) presented the same configuration as the purified magnetosomes (control; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215657.g003">Fig 3I</xref>), which is consistent with magnetite [<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. No change in the oxidation state was observed even at the border of the mineral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215657.g003">Fig 3C and 3F</xref> black and green lines, respectively), suggesting that these nanoparticles are not undergoing chemical modifications by the cell after 120 h of internalization. EELS mapping near magnetosomes did not show any significant free iron concentration in this area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215657.g003">Fig 3C and 3F</xref>; blue line on both images), confirming that these magnetosomes were not submitted to a rapid process of degradation/dissolution. On the other hand, smaller structures of approximately 5 nm were observed near the magnetosomes in endosomes and within the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215657.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215657.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). HRTEM shows a lattice plane in these structures with only one detected interplanar distance (2.6 &#x000c5;), which cannot be used to identify the iron oxide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215657.s002">S2D Fig</xref>). STEM-EELS revealed the presence of iron oxide at O-K and Fe-L<sub>2,3</sub> edges, but oxygen peaks did not present enough resolution to allow the specific identification of the iron oxide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215657.g004">Fig 4B&#x02013;4E</xref>). In these cases, identification was not possible because of the low signal provided by the analysis of this fine structure considering the high noise caused by the background. In addition to these fine structures, low contrast areas were unusually observed in internalized magnetosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215657.g004">Fig 4A</xref>; dashed circles); which also suggest minor defects/damage in the crystal that would not be detected based on size and shape. In ultrathin sections, where the magnetosomes were inside endosomes, these structures might represent a minor degradation of magnetosomes, although magnetosome crystal analysis showed that there was no alteration of crystal structure nor difference in morphology and size of magnetosomes when compared to control. Dissolution-reprecipitation processes have been described during the thermal conversion of maghemite to hematite in aqueous solutions [<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and could be related to this structure, indicating the first evidence of magnetosome degradation within a mammalian cell.</p><fig id="pone.0215657.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0215657.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>STEM-EELS analysis of magnetosomes&#x02019; magnetite crystals in endosome (A-C), directly within the cytoplasm of a HeLa cell (D-F), and freshly purified magnetosome (control; G-I).</title><p>A) STEM-HAADF image of magnetosomes showing the areas used for analysis (dashed rectangle) and drift correction (solid square).

Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we evaluated the cytotoxicity and possible degradation of magnetosomes using HeLa cells as a model lineage. Our results showed that magnetosomes are biocompatible and are not oxidized or suffer morphological changes after internalization by cells. In contrast, studies using synthetic magnetic particles showed toxic effects over cells after 24 h of incubation [<xref rid="pone.0215657.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The presence of fine crystalline iron-containing structures of approximately 5 nm near internalized magnetosomes might be an indication of a slow degradation or the detachment of small parts of the nanoparticles due to original defects (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215657.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). If true, this process would be a great advantage for the use of magnetite magnetosomes in many medical and biotechnological applications because it would guarantee nontoxic effects on the cell due to the derisory release of low concentrations of soluble iron over a long period. Moreover, the presence of a biological membrane in isolated magnetosomes and after some period in endocytic vesicles enlarges the range of possible applications of magnetosomes in the bioengineering area. Overall, this suggests that magnetite magnetosomes remain as stable structures in biological systems for long periods, which is also desirable for prolonged treatments.</p><p>For an appropriate, accurate comparison, a long-term <italic>in vitro</italic> study using high-resolution microscopy and micro/nano-analysis techniques should be performed. We suggest that studies about magnetosome degradation in different cell lines should be focussed on the analysis of the oxidation of magnetosomes magnetite crystals particularly at regions near the crystal borders by scanning transmission electron microscopy- electron energy loss spectroscopy approach as described here. Hopefully, this approach will contribute to the understanding of magnetosome degradation/persistence in biological systems. The comparison among different iron oxide nanoparticles degradation in model cell lines is necessary to acquire precise and standardized information, which are relevant to the development of new and save approaches in Nanotechnology and Biomedicine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec009"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0215657.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Mean (A) size and (B) shape factor of magnetosomes in freshly purified (control), in endosomes and cytoplasm after HeLa cells internalization.</title><p>No statically significant differences were observed among samples.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0215657.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0215657.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><p>A) STEM-HAADF image of magnetosomes inside endosome; dashed square shows the crystal imaged by HRTEM (B).
