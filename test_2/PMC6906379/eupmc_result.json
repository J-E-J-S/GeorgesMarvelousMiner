    "Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains the deadliest of all the lung cancer types. Its high mortality is largely attributed to the invariable development of resistance to standard chemo/radiotherapies, which have remained unchanged for the past 30 years, underscoring the need for new therapeutic approaches. The discovery of molecular targets for chemoprevention and treatment has been hampered by the poor understanding of SCLC progression. In recent years, comprehensive omics-based analyses have led to the discovery of recurrent alterations in patient tumors, and functional studies using genetically engineered mouse models and patient-derived tumor models have provided information about the alterations critical for SCLC pathogenesis. Defining the somatic alterations scattered throughout the SCLC genome will help to understand the underlying mechanism of this devastating disease and pave the way for the discovery of therapeutic vulnerabilities associated with the genomic alterations."
