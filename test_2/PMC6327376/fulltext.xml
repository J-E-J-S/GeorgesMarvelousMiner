Public availability of data obtained from high-throughput genotyping and/or exome massive parallel sequencing (MPS)-based projects from several thousands of outbred samples might become useful tools to evaluate the pathogenicity of a VUS, based on its frequency in different populations. In the case of the Mexican and other Latino populations, several thousands of samples have been genotyped or sequenced during the last few years as part of different efforts to identify common variants associated to common diseases. In this report, we analyzed Mexican population data from a sample of 3985 outbred individuals, and additional 66 hereditary breast cancer patients were analyzed in order to better define the spectrum of common genomic variation of the <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> genes. Our analyses identified the most common genetic variants in these clinically relevant genes as well as the presence and frequency of specific pathogenic mutations present in the Mexican population. Analysis of the 3985 population samples by MPS identified three pathogenic mutations in <italic>BRCA1</italic>, only one population sample showed a <italic>BRCA1</italic> exon 16&#x02013;17 deletion by MLPA. This resulted in a basal prevalence of deleterious mutations of 0.10% (1:996) for <italic>BRCA1</italic> and 11 pathogenic mutations in <italic>BRCA2</italic>, resulting in a basal prevalence of deleterious mutations of 0.276% (1:362) for <italic>BRCA2</italic>, combined of 0.376% (1:265). Separate analysis of the breast cancer patients identified the presence of pathogenic mutations in 18% (12 pathogenic mutations in 66 patients) of the samples by MPS and 13 additional alterations by MLPA. These results will support a better interpretation of clinical studies focused on the detection of BRCA mutations in Mexican and Latino populations and will help to define the general prevalence of deleterious mutations within these populations.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s40246-018-0188-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>BRCA</kwd><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Populations</kwd><kwd>Germline</kwd><kwd>Genetic testing</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Astra Zeneca Mexico (MEX)</institution></funding-source><award-id>ESR-16-12517</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2"><italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> might represent two of the most characterized genes in the human genome due to their association with hereditary cancer syndromes. However, the complete spectrum of <italic>BRCA</italic> genetic variation among ethnically diverse populations has not been fully described. Germline mutations in these genes are mainly associated to familial breast and ovarian cancer and more recently with pancreatic and prostate cancer. In addition to the identification of subjects with a higher risk of developing cancer in a familial setting, detection of deleterious germline <italic>BRCA</italic> mutations is also required for the selection of treatment with PARP inhibitors, which can induce synthetic lethality in cancer cells in the presence of deleterious <italic>BRCA</italic> mutations. Currently, treatment with PARP inhibitors are approved for patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline <italic>BRCA</italic> mutations with <italic>HER2</italic>-negative metastatic breast cancer, for patients with hormone receptor-positive breast tumors that have been treated or are not susceptible to receive endocrine therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and in patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with three or more prior lines of chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">The prevalence of combined mutations in the totality of the coding region of these genes vary between different countries and ethnic groups, being approximately 0.3% in Caucasian women in the USA and 2.5% in Jewish women living in Israel or in the USA. A recent paper focused on the analysis of exome sequencing-based screening for BRCA1/2 among adult biobank participants identified a higher frequency of pathogenic/likely pathogenic mutations than previous reports, identifying a 1:180 prevalence of deleterious mutations and suggesting that compared with previous clinical care, exome sequencing-based screening identified five times as many individuals with pathogenic or likely pathogenic <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">The prevalence of mutations in Latin American populations has not yet been fully defined. In Mexico, a limited number of analyses in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have been carried out using different methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These studies have identified the presence of pathogenic germline mutations in 28% of the patients with ovarian cancer and 15% of the patients with breast cancer, without any selection for family history. The percentage of BRCA1 mutations in women diagnosed with triple negative breast tumors, without any selection for familial cancer, increases up to 28%. In patients with ovarian cancer, without any selection for familial cancer, the BRCA1 ex9-12del mutation was detected in 33% of the cases, supporting the notion that this is a founder mutation in Mexico [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">A recent review about mutations in the BRCA genes identified a clear founder effect in several Latin American populations, including Mexico (BRCA1 ex9&#x02013;12del), Brazil (<italic>BRCA1</italic> 5382insC y <italic>BRCA2</italic> c.156_157insAlu), and Colombia (<italic>BRCA1</italic> 3450del4, A1708E, y <italic>BRCA2</italic> 3034del4), as well as in Latino population from southern California (<italic>BRCA1</italic> 185delAG, IVS5+1G&#x0003e;A, S955x, y R1443x). The differences in the frequency and type of <italic>BRCA</italic> mutations in Latin America have been associated with the admixture dynamics in each specific population and with the differences in the proportions of ancestral components resulting from the admixture processes over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">However, the analysis of a much higher number of samples is necessary in order to define the frequency of pathogenic mutations and to define the whole spectrum of common genetic variation in clinically relevant genes in the Mexican population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. With the advent of massive parallel sequencing and the reduction of costs for sequencing-based diagnostic panels, this situation is already improving. Nonetheless, it will take time to have enough clinical samples to define the population-wide spectrum of common variation and to define a better threshold to evaluate pathogenicity based on allele frequency, as recommended by the American Colleague of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology. To define this threshold, it is necessary to have population-based genotyping information, in order to determine if the allele frequency of a particular variant is &#x0201c;higher&#x0201d; than expected for the disorder, a situation that provides strong evidence to consider the variant benign [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Fortunately, thanks to the public availability of data obtained from high-throughput genotyping and/or massive parallel exome sequencing projects from several thousands of outbred samples (ExAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], 1000 genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]), we can analyze the presence of specific variants in different populations in order to compare how common they are and to evaluate their potential pathogenicity depending on their allele frequency.</p><p id="Par7">In the case of the Mexican and other Latino populations, several thousands of samples have been genotyped or sequenced during the last few years as part of different efforts to identify common variants associated to common diseases, such as diabetes (The Slim Initiative in Genomic Medicine for the Americas (SIGMA) T2D Consortium) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

Erroneous interpretation of genetic data, such as when a patient is incorrectly informed that one of his or her variants is causal when in fact it is benign, have important adverse consequences for the patients and for their families.</p><p id="Par36">A better interpretation of these analyses requires the inclusion of populations of diverse ethnical backgrounds, both through access to the tests themselves and also as part of scientific efforts aimed to describe human genomic diversity and its role in human disease. Several examples clearly show that this lack of representation already represents an important clinical problem for the interpretation of genetic tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], resulting in what has been called a &#x0201c;double disparity&#x0201d; where access to testing is limited and the interpretation of results are complicated by the lack of data from populations with a non-European background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">In Mexico, access to genetic testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer is still not widely available, limiting the amount of patient-derived data necessary to refine interpretation of their results. Fortunately, data generated from the research front is helping to mitigate this problem. In the last years, high-throughput genotyping and whole exome/genome sequencing efforts have included outbred samples from diverse ethnical populations, offering the possibility to contrast the frequency of suspicious variants against open population frequencies. These efforts include the Mexican genome diversity project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and, more recently, exome sequencing projects aimed to the identification of common variants associated to diabetes and other diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that this exome-based population approach might be more efficient in the identification of the frequency of pathogenic or likely pathogenic <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutations, being able to identify five times as many individuals with deleterious mutations compared to studies focused on selected populations in the clinical care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Based on this data, in this paper, we describe the spectrum of common genomic variation in the <italic>BRCA</italic> genes in the Mexican population. Our analyses allowed us to identify variants that are enriched in the Mexican and Latino populations and to identify the identity and frequency of pathogenic mutations present in open population samples.</p><p id="Par39">From a sample consisting of 3985 population samples (143 sequenced in this study and 3842 from the SIGMA study), we identified 15 pathogenic mutations (3 detected by massive parallel sequencing and 1 by MPLA in BRCA1 and 11 in BRCA2, all detected by sequencing), resulting in a population frequency of deleterious mutations of 0.10% (1:996) for BRCA1 and 0.276% (1:362) for BRCA2, combined of 0.376% (1:265).&#x000a0;This is similar to what has been reported for population frequency carriers in ExAC without The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) samples: 0.15% (1:646) for <italic>BRCA1</italic> and 0.26% for <italic>BRCA2</italic> (1:390; combined 0.41% 1:243). In 2016, the total population in Mexico was of 127.5 million, escalating the frequency of mutations, resulting in approximately 481,132&#x000a0;carriers of deleterious <italic>BRCA</italic> mutations among the Mexican population.</p><p id="Par40">In order to evaluate the potential pathogenicity of variants with uncertain clinical significance, based on population-based data, we reviewed both the frequency and filtering allele frequency of the seven VUS detected in our breast cancer patients. The low frequency of an allele might be a criterion suggesting variant pathogenicity, but since frequency alone is not sufficient to define association with disease, we also reviewed their statistical threshold to filter them out if they are too common in the population to be associated with disease, based on the ExAC data (filtering AF in the ExAC browser). Four variants were filtered: rs80358861 (in European non-Finish), rs80359018 (Latino), rs80357323 (African), rs80358877 (Latino), but still, for two additional variants (rs80358947, rs80358621), this approach was not possible, since they are not described ExAC and have not yet been reviewed by ENIGMA). Sixty-seven additional variants were identified in the breast cancer patients which have not been described in BRCA Exchange and are not present in ExAC and might represent private polymorphisms.</p><p id="Par41">Our sample collection reflects the genomic diversity of the Mexican population, based on the sample distribution in our PCA analysis, and we did not observed enrichment of particular variants regardless of the state of origin of the sample. We expected to see an enrichment of European-associated variants in the Northern states of Mexico (Sonora) or in samples with a higher percentage of European ancestral component. This suggests that the distribution of <italic>BRCA</italic> variants among the Mexican population might not differ significantly throughout different regions of the country. In fact, our dataset is particularly enriched in samples with a higher percentage of Amerindian ancestry (75% of Amerindian ancestral component on average); this would more likely represent variants which are enriched in in the Amerindian population, and this is supported by the observation that most of the variants detected in our population-based analysis were only present on the Latino population of ExAC.</p><p id="Par42">In conclusion, our analyses allowed us to better define the common genomic variation of the <italic>BRCA</italic> genes in the Mexican open population, identifying specific pathogenic mutations and allowing the first calculation of the mutation burden in these clinically relevant genes in Mexico. Given the observed enrichment of these mutations the Latino population, our data will also be helpful to improve the interpretation of <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutation tests in other Latin American countries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>
