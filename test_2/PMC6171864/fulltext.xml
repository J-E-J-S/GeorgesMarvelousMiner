Increased MIEN1 expression in many types of tumors leads to disease progression and metastatic propensity. It is unclear precisely how MIEN1 is involved in this process and more studies are required to tease out the mechanisms. Here we show that Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR) genome editing effectively produced specific genomic deletions in the <italic>MIEN1</italic> gene which led to the abrogation of its expression in breast cancer cells. The single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) mediated targeting of <italic>MIEN1</italic> was specific and none of the clones screened for off-target cleavage revealed any insertions or deletions (indels). Additionally, disruption of the <italic>MIEN1</italic> gene did not alter the cell morphology, growth, proliferation or survival. Knocking out <italic>MIEN1</italic> in these breast cancer cells will allow future studies to determine the exact role MIEN1 plays in breast tumor metastasis, which might lead to production of novel therapeutics to treat this and other cancers.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006545</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1P20 MD006882</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vishwanatha</surname><given-names>Jamboor K.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Grant 1P20 MD006882 to JKV.

MIEN1 has been shown to functionally increase the invasive and migratory phenotype of various types of cells including breast cancer, prostate cancer, oral cancer, fibroblasts and endothelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0204976.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0204976.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

These data indicate that MIEN1 is an important molecule which sits at the crossroads of cytoskeletal dynamics and signaling cascades which culminate in metastatic function and gene expression.

Co-transfection of the two sgRNAs allows for simultaneous Cas9 endonuclease-mediated cleavage at both target sites. During the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair process following simultaneous cleavage, the intervening DNA sequence is lost. It has been shown that NHEJ after deletion using two sgRNAs often results in precise repair without large insertions/deletions (indels) [<xref rid="pone.0204976.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, the deletion of DNA can be easily resolved on an agarose gel following PCR amplification across the deleted segment. Primers were designed flanking the two sgRNAs targeting the <italic>MIEN1</italic> gene which yielded a 589bp amplicon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204976.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Following deletion and NHEJ, the deletion amplicon is reduced to approximately 379bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204976.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In addition to simultaneous cleavage, deletion and NHEJ, there are several other possible Cas9 cleavage mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204976.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). First, simultaneous cleavage occurs, but the intervening segment in not deleted and is instead re-inserted during NHEJ, which introduces indels at both target sites. Second, cleavage occurs at one of the target sites and NHEJ is performed before cleavage occurs at the other target site. Third, simultaneous cleavage occurs, however the intervening segment is inverted and then re-inserted during NHEJ. Fourth, cleavage and NHEJ occurs at only one of the two sites. All of these scenarios should also result in gene product KO, but none of them are able to be detected using the deletion PCR reaction alone as they will all most likely yield an amplicon close to the wild-type length. In order to be able to identify clones which were edited by these alternate mechanisms, we designed an indel PCR reaction using one of the sgRNA oligos which was cloned into the PX458 vector (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204976.s002">S1 Table</xref>).

In order to see the effect of MIEN1 KO on general cellular characteristics, we first examined the morphology of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204976.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). There was no observable difference in the morphology of the MIEN1 KO cell lines when compared to their parental cell lines. Next, we performed MTT assays using the 4175 lung metastatic cell line and its MIEN KO derivative to study proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204976.g005">Fig 5B</xref>) and cell survival following serum deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204976.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). There was no difference in the growth rate of the two cell lines as the 4175 cells had a doubling time of 32.7 hours while the 4175-MKO cells had a doubling time of 33.5 hours. Likewise, there was no observable difference in the time-course cell survival of the two cell lines. Several early time points did yield significantly different results between the two cell lines, however these differences were not consistent throughout the time-course. Finally, to see if MIEN1 KO had an effect on 3-dimentional spheroid growth, 4175 and 4175-MKO cells were grown in Matrigel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204976.g005">Fig 5D and 5E</xref>).

There is still debate about the benefits and applications of CRISPR vs other gene expression regulation systems, such as RNA interference (RNAi). However, CRISPR has been shown to yield more reproducible data and minimize global off-target effects compared to RNAi [<xref rid="pone.0204976.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204976.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. While there are concerns about the specificity and potential off-target effects of CRISPR-Cas systems [<xref rid="pone.0204976.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204976.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], much work is being done to improve the specificity of sgRNAs and reduce the off-target cleavage of Cas proteins through genetic mutation [<xref rid="pone.0204976.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204976.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204976.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Here we have used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to eliminate MIEN1 protein from breast cancer cells which normally have high MIEN1 expression. Two sgRNAs were used to delete a segment from the <italic>MIEN1</italic> gene. Our results demonstrate that the co-expression of these sgRNAs with the Cas9 endonuclease resulted in a high on-target editing efficiency (47%) in four breast cancer cell lines with no off-target effects. The majority of these edited cells showed no MIEN1 protein expression when screened by western blot indicating that we have developed a potent system for producing MIEN1 KO cell lines for future experiments.</p><p>We and others have previously shown that MIEN1 is an oncogene involved in the migration, invasion and progression of breast, prostate and oral cancers and is associated with decreased overall survival [<xref rid="pone.0204976.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0204976.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204976.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204976.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. MIEN1 mediates many pro-metastatic signals including activation of Akt kinase which facilitates downstream gene expression through NF-kB [<xref rid="pone.0204976.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and modulation of actin cytoskeleton to facilitate cell motility [<xref rid="pone.0204976.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Because of the importance of MIEN1 in cancer progression and metastatic events, producing CRISPR mediated MIEN1 KO cells will allow us to better understand the role of MIEN1 in these various processes. Knocking out MIEN1 in these cancer cells allows us to study the effect of its absence from a background where it is normally expressed rather than over-expressing it in a cell line which does not have endogenous expression. We have confirmed through CRISPR deletion that MIEN1 does not play a role in the proliferation and survival of breast cancer cells, even within 3D culture. This platform will also allow us to further study how MIEN1 contributes to metastatic processes and validate its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0204976.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Full western blots from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204976.g004">Fig 4</xref>.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0204976.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0204976.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Oligos.</title><p>Sequences and orientations of oligos used within this study.
