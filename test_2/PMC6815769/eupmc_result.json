    "Infectious diseases are a type of disease caused by pathogenic microorganisms. Although the discovery of antibiotics changed the treatment of infectious diseases and reduced the mortality of bacterial infections, resistant bacterial strains have emerged. Anti-infective therapy based on aetiological evidence is the gold standard for clinical treatment, but the time lag and low positive culture rate of traditional methods of pathogen diagnosis leads to relative difficulty in obtaining the evidence of pathogens. Compared with traditional methods of pathogenic diagnosis, next-generation and third-generation sequencing technologies have many advantages in the detection of pathogenic microorganisms. In this review, we mainly introduce recent progress in research on pathogenic diagnostic technology and the applications of sequencing technology in the diagnosis of pathogenic microorganisms. This review provides new insights into the application of sequencing technology in the clinical diagnosis of microorganisms."
