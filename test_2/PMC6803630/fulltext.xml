The most successful approaches to date are based on modulating mRNA synthesis via an inducible coupling to transcriptional effectors. Here we present a biological programming structure that leverages a system of engineered transcription factors and complementary genetic architectures. We use a modular design strategy to create 27 non-natural and non-synonymous transcription factors using the lactose repressor topology as a guide. To direct systems of engineered transcription factors we employ parallel and series genetic (DNA) architectures and confer fundamental and combinatorial logical control over gene expression. Here we achieve AND, OR, NOT, and NOR logical controls in addition to two non-canonical half-AND operations. The basic logical operations and corresponding parallel and series genetic architectures represent the building blocks for subsequent combinatorial programs, which display both digital and analog performance.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Successful approaches for controlling gene expression modulate mRNA synthesis by coupling it to inducible transcription effectors.

Although logic in synthetic gene networks can be accomplished either at the transcriptional or translational levels, the former is more commonly employed in the development of synthetic gene networks via the use of transcription factors (TFs) to activate or repress genes of interest. Broadly speaking, TFs are DNA-binding proteins capable of blocking (or recruiting) RNA polymerase activity at the site of genetic promoters, and these functions can be combined in modular ways to engineer synthetic gene networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. For the most part, early bacterial gene circuits were based on a core set of repressors, namely, TetR, LacI, and bacteriophage &#x003bb; cI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, which have been extensively studied.</p><p id="Par4">The lactose repressor (LacI) is a workhorse in the field of synthetic biology. LacI or I<sup>+</sup><sub>YQR</sub> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) is a canonical molecular switch, serving as the central regulatory protein in the lac operon of <italic>Escherichia coli (E. coli)</italic>. Under normal cellular conditions, LacI will bind to the O<sup>1</sup> operator site and prevent transcription of downstream genes by physically blocking and compromising the activity of RNA polymerase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In the presence of the chemical signal isopropyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactoside or IPTG (a nonhydrolyzable analog of the natural inducer 1,6-allolactose) LacI undergoes a conformational shift that results in decreased affinity for its cognate DNA operator. This event allows transcription of the downstream gene to proceed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Although the structure of the 360 amino acid LacI protein can be divided into several (sub)domains, for simplicity we will group them into the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the regulatory core domain (RCD).The first 60 residues constitute the N-terminal DBD containing the helix-turn-helix motif, which aids in the recognition of the O<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> operator region. Residues 61&#x02013;330 constitute the RCD, which encompasses the regions responsible for dimer assembly (C-subdomain), ligand binding, and for mediating and propagating the allosteric signal across the protein (N-subdomain). The functional unit of LacI is a dimer, however residues 331&#x02013;360 make up the C-terminal tetramerization domain which facilitates the dimerization of two functional units<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Workflow for generating X<sub>ADR</sub> transcription factors. <bold>a</bold> Top panel illustrates the regulatory protein template. This system consists of three parts: a dimeric transcription factor (TF) along with its corresponding ligand (L), and its cognate DNA operator (OP). The interaction between the protein and its operator is modulated by binding of a complementary ligand and the system exchanges between the operator bound and unbound states (inset). The TF can be divided into two components, the regulatory core domain, or RCD and the (alternate) DNA recognition unit (ADR). The regulatory core domain can be further divided into the N- and C-subdomains, with the ligand binding domain at the cleft formed between the two. <bold>b</bold> Middle panel shows the discrete modules utilized in this work encompassing six regulatory core domains corresponding to five distinct ligands and seven Alternate DNA Recognition (ADR) units along with the corresponding DNA operator elements. The modules can be exchanged to yield a total of 42 combinations including 7 I<sup>A</sup><sub>ADR</sub> that have been previously reported. TF function can be classified into four distinct phenotypes. <bold>c</bold> The X<sup>+</sup> or repressor phenotype inhibits gene expression in the absence of inducer by binding to the operator.

Most members of this family are structurally similar and several respond to their respective inducers in much the same way LacI responds to IPTG. In recent years, a library of chimeric repressors has been engineered by replacing the RCD of LacI with regulatory core domains from homologous LacI/GalR family members. This has generated LacI-like transcription factors capable of regulating the <italic>lac</italic> promoter via the O<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> operator, while still responding to the homolog&#x02019;s corresponding natural inducer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Moreover, the DBD of LacI has previously been modified to achieve alternate DNA recognition (ADR) via the introduction of the point mutations Y17T, Q18A, R22N (i.e., the TAN mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>) to create functionally orthogonal repressors which can be used to generate a variety of biological AND gates. For example, Shis et al. used several LacI/GalR chimeras to construct parallel AND gates, which used multiple TFs simultaneously with minimal cross-talk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Efforts in recent years have been made to expand the set of transcription factors that can be used toward the design of genetic circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.

The ability to exert ligand (signal) control directly at the transcription factor level eliminates the need for ligand inducible promoters or the need to use sensors independent of the logical circuitry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Finally, pairing these X<sup>+</sup><sub>ADR</sub> repressors with our previously engineered collection of LacI suppressors (I<sup>A(X)</sup><sub>YQR</sub> and I<sup>A(X)</sup><sub>ADR</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>) allows for the development of combinatorial and non-canonical logical operations.

Here we extended this workflow to simultaneously vary the RCD and the ADR (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). In brief, we adapted 5 disparate LacI/GalR regulatory core domains (CelR &#x02261; E, FruR &#x02261; F, GalR &#x02261; G, GalS &#x02261; S, and RbsR &#x02261; R) with six non-natural DNA-binding domains (NAR, HQN, TAN, GKR, HTK, and KSL), plus one naturally occurring domain (YQR) from LacI (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Collectively, this resulted in a RCD-ADR combinatorial design space of 35 putative transcription factors (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). In principle, each engineered transcription factor binds to a single non-natural DNA operator (O<sup>gta</sup>, O<sup>tta</sup>, O<sup>gac</sup>, O<sup>ctt</sup>, and O<sup>agg</sup> - respectively), while the YQR DNA-binding domain is complemented by the native O<sup>1</sup> (or symmetric O<sup>sym</sup>) DNA operator. Mechanistically, when a given DNA operator is in proximity to a promoter element, transcription factor binding (to operator DNA) interferes with RNA polymerase function, inhibiting transcription (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, e</xref>). We postulated that each putative transcription factor adapted with a given ADR unit would retain the parental wild-type repressor phenotype (i.e., X<sup>+</sup><sub>ADR</sub>, where X&#x02009;=&#x02009;G, E, R, S, and F) when paired with a cognate DNA operator element (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Alternate DNA-binding domains and cognate operators were selected from a pool of engineered (non-natural) systems previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, in which the DNA-binding motif and the cognate operator were simultaneously evolved and adapted via the wild-type LacI (I<sup>+</sup>) regulatory core domain. Out of the ~200 functional alternate DNA-binding domains and cognate non-natural operators, we selected the 6 ADR-operator sets for this study based on the performance metrics observed in our previous study, Rondon and Wilson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. In the aforementioned study, we adapted a collection of engineered LacI suppressors (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>) with 6 non-natural ADR. The 6 ADR (plus YQR) were functional in both repressor (I<sup>+</sup>) and suppressor (I<sup>A</sup>) phenotypes. The wild-type YQR/O<sup>1</sup> set was selected for this study to enable the transcription factors created in this work to function in cooperation with the foundational antilacs (suppressors) engineered in Richards et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Likewise, the 35 putative X<sup>+</sup><sub>ADR</sub> variants tested in this study were selected to function as complementary systems to the suppressors adapted with ADR from our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Performance of engineered transcription factors</title><p id="Par8">At the outset, we evaluated each of the 35 putative transcription factors paired with a single cognate DNA operator (i.e., data along the diagonals in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a&#x02013;e</xref>, summarized in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).

In our SERI architecture, the first DNA operator was intercalated within the promoter element and was designated as the core position, whereas the second DNA operator was located downstream of the promoter in the proximal position (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The SERI and PARA genetic architectures can support any combination of two DNA operators (i.e., non-natural or natural), and when paired with engineered transcription factors can result in fundamental and non-canonical logical operations to regulate gene expression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Genetic architectures and biological truth tables for logical operations. <bold>a</bold> In the series architecture (SERI), two operators are employed, each acted on by a transcription factor with a different ADR unit.

Namely, we constructed NOT, AND, and OR logical operations composed of engineered (non-natural) transcription factors and cognate operators arranged in PARA or SERI configurations. The representative NOT gate was composed of a single PARA channel configured with an O<sup>sym</sup> DNA operator and cognate I<sup>A</sup><sub>YQR</sub> suppressor (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, e</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7a</xref>). O<sup>sym</sup> is an O<sup>1</sup> variant in which the right-half of the operator has been symmetrized with the left to form a proper palindrome (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). In the absence of the effector ligand IPTG, I<sup>A</sup><sub>YQR</sub> cannot form a complex with O<sup>sym</sup> DNA, thus GFP was produced. In contrast, upon the addition of 10&#x02009;mM IPTG, the engineered antilac suppressor bound to operator DNA and suppressed GFP production. Next, we constructed an AND logic gate that leveraged the series (SERI) genetic architecture and two decoupled repressors (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). The AND gate was composed of the wild-type LacI repressor (I<sup>+</sup><sub>YQR</sub>) and the non-natural transcription factor CelR adapted with the alternate DNA-binding domain TAN (E<sup>+</sup><sub>TAN</sub>). In the absence of both effector ligands (IPTG and cellobiose) GFP was not produced, as both I<sup>+</sup><sub>YQR</sub> and E<sup>+</sup><sub>TAN</sub> repressed gene expression (i.e., blocked RNA polymerase function). The addition of IPTG or cellobiose alone cannot induce the full production of GFP, as at least one transcription factor (I<sup>+</sup><sub>YQR</sub> or E<sup>+</sup><sub>TAN</sub>) remained in the repressed state. Only the addition of both effector ligands resulted in the full production of the reporter GFP, and led to the near digital performance of the engineered AND gate. In turn, we constructed a fully synthetic AND gate using two non-natural repressors I<sup>+</sup><sub>TAN</sub> and E<sup>+</sup><sub>YQR</sub> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>).

Given the two channel architecture of this genetic circuit, there was an additive production of GFP (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7c</xref>).

However, digital devices are often driven by analog devices with an infinite range between a voltage high and a voltage low (ground). In order to convert an infinite number of states into only two outcomes, voltage logic levels are created by defining which voltage bands or ranges represent a logic high (1) or logic low (0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Likewise, we applied a similar set of threshold constraints to the OR logic gate (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7c</xref>). We opted to set output values below 0.5 normalized output units (N.O.U.) to 0, and values above 0.5&#x02009;N.O.U. to 1. Moreover, we applied the same logic state thresholds for 0 and 1 to all circuits described onward in this work. Analog performance is not unusual in biological circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>, as illustrated in the OR gate we constructed in this study (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). To a lesser extent, analog performance was also observed in the relative outputs of the core and proximal DNA operator positions in the SERI architecture. For example, in our engineered AND gate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>) asymmetry was observed in the performance of each of the individually induced operators. Specifically, the relative performance of the E<sup>+</sup><sub>TAN</sub>|O<sup>tta</sup> (core) vs. I<sup>+</sup><sub>YQR</sub>|O<sup>sym</sup> (proximal) operations upon single ligand induction was not equivalent. The observed uneven off-states can be explained in part by the differences in performance of the engineered transcription factors (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7b</xref>). In addition to transcription factor performance, Elowitz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> illustrated performance asymmetry as a result of DNA operator position. Namely, the core position had stronger RNA polymerase interference (i.e., stronger repression) relative to the proximal position. Therefore, given equivalent transcription factor performance, the induction of a core genetic configuration resulted in lower gene production relative to the proximal configuration. Accordingly, a more digital AND gate was achieved via the incorporation of a more digital repressor-operator pair (R<sup>+</sup><sub>YQR</sub>|O<sup>sym</sup>) at the proximal position (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7d</xref>). Inspired by the asymmetry in performance of core and proximal operator configurations, we introduced two non-canonical logical half-AND operations HAND<sub>(core)</sub> and hAND<sub>(proximal)</sub> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Combinatorial logic gating via the series architecture</title><p id="Par13">Combinatorial logic is a concept in which two or more fundamental operations (e.g., AND, OR, and NOT) can be systematically combined to produce more sophisticated logical gates. In principle, the combinational logic strategies that are employed toward the development of advanced electronic circuits can be applied to the fundamental biological edifice we developed in this study. Bearing in mind that electronic digital circuits are physically isolated, and gene circuits do not share the same degree of physical sequestration (unless they are cellularly compartmentalized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>). Rather than viewing the lack of isolated operations within our systems as an impediment, we can leverage this inherent connectivity to generate unique combinations of logical operations (canonical or non-canonical) with programming rules that are distinctive to biological logic. Moreover, these deviations in biological circuit functions (from traditional digital circuit behavior) allow for the development of a vastly more dynamic programming language (i.e., circuits that can be simultaneously programmed horizontally and vertically). To demonstrate the potential of our emerging non-natural transcriptional programming structure, we constructed two combinatorial logic gates via the SERI genetic architecture. The first combinational program used two-signal coupled repressors, G<sup>+</sup><sub>TAN</sub> and I<sup>+</sup><sub>YQR</sub>, and two cognate DNA operators O<sup>tta</sup> (core) and O<sup>sym</sup> (proximal) in series (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a, b</xref>). The wild-type repressors LacI(I<sup>+</sup>) and GalR(G<sup>+</sup>) share a conditional signal overlap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Studies have shown that 10&#x02009;mM IPTG competitively inhibited the GalR repressor, and resulted an insensitivity to the cognate effector ligand <sc>d</sc>-fucose. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the engineered G<sup>+</sup><sub>TAN</sub> repressor would exhibit similar IPTG interference, and that this behavior could be used as a conditional repressor when coupled with I<sup>+</sup><sub>YQR</sub> in series. To test this hypothesis, we first demonstrated that 10&#x02009;mM IPTG competitively inhibited the G<sup>+</sup><sub>TAN</sub> repressor, and resulted in insensitivity to the cognate effector <sc>d</sc>-fucose in isolation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8a</xref>). Objectively, this resulted in a conditional NOT gate, such that an apparent G<sup>S</sup><sub>TAN</sub> phenotype was observed in the presence of 10&#x02009;mM IPTG (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Next, we constructed a SERI genetic circuit that assumed an AND&#x02009;+&#x02009;NOT logical combination in which the AND gate is controlled by the addition of 1&#x02009;mM IPTG and <sc>d</sc>-fucose to achieve a relative on-state (i.e., maximum GFP output). However, upon the addition of 10&#x02009;mM IPTG and 10&#x02009;mM <sc>d</sc>-fucose, the circuit reverts to the off-state (i.e., no GFP output). Practically, this combinatorial logic gate functions as an apparent bandpass filter that only allowed the production of the output interface (GFP) within a certain effector ligand concentration, and attenuated (rejected) GFP production at or above 10&#x02009;mM IPTG (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8b</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Combinatorial logic via the SERI architectures and bandpass operations. <bold>a</bold> IPTG acts as a competitive inhibitor to GalR, preventing GFP expression upon addition of fucose in the presence of 10&#x02009;mM IPTG.

For example, we constructed an asymmetric parallel (PARA) configuration composed of three non-synonymous DNA operators (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). The top channel consisted of a single non-natural DNA operator (O<sup>agg</sup>) located in the proximal position.

The genetic structure was complemented by three decoupled transcription factors I<sup>+</sup><sub>YQR</sub>, E<sup>+</sup><sub>KSL</sub>, and F<sup>+</sup><sub>TAN</sub>, that were responsive to three disparate effector ligands (IPTG, cellobiose, and fructose &#x02013; respectively). Both channels returned the same GFP output interface. Objectively, the system resulted in a non-canonical logical program (hAND [PARA] AND) controlled via three-signal inputs. This genetic program had a performance profile comparable to a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), where the system generated various output levels that corresponded to different digital input combinations (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9a</xref>).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Digital-to-analog converters (DAC) and NOR gates.

However, instead of two synonymous outputs, we coupled the top channel to the bottom channel via a non-natural transcription factor paired to a DNA operator located on the second channel that controlled the GFP output. The production of the R<sup>+</sup><sub>HQN</sub> repressor was controlled via a two-signal AND gate. When the signal IPTG or cellobiose was added the top channel produced intermediate amounts of the engineered repressor. Whereas, the maximum R<sup>+</sup><sub>HQN</sub> repressor output was only produced upon the addition of both signal inputs at 10&#x02009;mM. The production of the R<sup>+</sup><sub>HQN</sub> transcription factor was coupled to a GFP output interface, located on the bottom channel. The R<sup>+</sup><sub>HQN</sub> repressor was paired with the cognate operator O<sup>ttg</sup>, with a background of 10&#x02009;mM <sc>d</sc>-ribose under every condition to alleviate repression. This DAC program presented an inverted series of outputs, relative to the previous DAC program (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a, b</xref>).

To demonstrate how the performance of an engineered repressor influenced the apparent outcome of genetic programs (with similar structure), we modified the single GFP output digital-to-analog converter developed in the last iteration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). The objective representation of the modified system was AND [PARA] hAND (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). The key differences between the two programs being: (i) the exchange of R<sup>+</sup><sub>HQN</sub> for R<sup>+</sup><sub>KSL</sub>, (ii) the relative position of the operator being acted on was moved from the core to the proximal position, (iii) the R<sup>+</sup><sub>KSL</sub> repressor had a fold induction that was less than one third of that observed for R<sup>+</sup><sub>HQN</sub>. Given the significant change in performance of R<sup>+</sup><sub>KSL</sub>, relative to R<sup>+</sup><sub>HQN</sub> (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9c</xref>), the observed performance switches from analog outputs (that vary with different combinations of input signals) to a more digital output profile. Moreover, reassessment of the truth table and corresponding output data revealed the development of an apparent NOR gate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>).

In principle, the genetic master circuit can generate any of the logical programs presented in this study, provided the appropriate systems of engineered transcription factors and cognate operators are selected. Using the master architecture we constructed a full four-signal combinatorial program (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11a</xref>). The performance of this system (with two synonymous output reporters) gave rise to our most granular digital-to-analog converter. In addition to the DAC performance, the program had a time-independent step response (output) profile. The observed input dependent step response was the result of an imposed asymmetric output maxima of the top and bottom channels (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11a</xref>).

In most cases, there was no appreciable difference between the growth curves of cells coding for 0&#x02013;2 transcription factors. However, once the cells expressed either 3 or 4 transcription factors, a marked decrease in the growth rate was observed as evidenced by the doubling time, or the slope of the exponential region of the growth curve. In some cases, specific combinations of transcription factors impacted the growth rate. Interestingly, all cells reached the exponential phase at approximately the same time and quickly diverged in their growth profiles. While, multiple transcription factors expressed in the chassis exerted a sizable burden on the cells; the cells were still capable of robust, predictable, and reproducible circuit performance.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>A complex program via the master architecture.

The SERI and PARA structures were used to systematically arrange cognate DNA operators and facilitate the development of combinatorial logic gating. Given that the engineered transcription factors are adapted with alternate DNA recognition and operator DNA elements that are not represented in nature, the resulting logical operations can be constructed and operated alongside existing natural genetic programs. Moreover, we have adapted each representative regulatory core domain with the native LacI DNA-binding domain. This will facilitate program coupling with the wild-type LacI repressor (I<sup>+</sup><sub>YQR</sub>) or engineered antilac suppressor (I<sup>A</sup><sub>YQR</sub>), via a shared DNA operator O<sup>1</sup> (or O<sup>sym</sup>). The six alternate DNA recognition (ADR) domains used in this study to confer repressive function in E<sup>+</sup>, G<sup>+</sup>, S<sup>+</sup>, F<sup>+</sup> and R<sup>+</sup> RCDs, are also shared among 46 engineered antilacs (I<sup>A</sup><sub>ADR</sub>) and 6 related I<sup>+</sup><sub>ADR</sub> repressors. This will enable a broad range of functional coupling by way of shared DNA-binding functions. The coupling of engineered transcription factors can also be extended via shared ligand binding functions. Namely, seven I<sup>+</sup><sub>ADR</sub> repressors, seven I<sup>A</sup><sub>ADR</sub> suppressors, seven G<sup>+</sup><sub>ADR</sub> and six S<sup>+</sup><sub>ADR</sub> repressors share a common binding function to IPTG &#x02013; though disparate phenotypes upon effector ligand binding. While this system of engineered transcription factors is large (i.e., 27&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;+&#x02009;<sub>ADR</sub> &#x02013; where X&#x02009;=&#x02009;E, G, S, F and R; 46 I<sup>A</sup><sub>ADR</sub>; and 6 I<sup>+</sup><sub>ADR</sub>), the putative combinatorial design space that can be used toward the development of additional non-natural transcription factors is even more astonishing. Swint-Kruse et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> estimates that there are more than 1000 regulatory core domains that share the same topology to those used in this study. In addition, Lewis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> has identified ~200 non-natural (alternate) DNA-binding domains and cognate operator combinations that can potentially be adapted to any given RCD. Consequently, these parts represent a combinatorial design space of ~10<sup>5</sup> putative transcription factors. Even if only 1% of these engineered transcription factors are functional, this could lead to the generation of hundreds of non-natural regulatory proteins with a variety of performance characteristics.</p><p id="Par20">Ultimately, we are interested in codifying our programming structure and the first step toward this goal is to establish a metrology for our system of engineered transcription factors. This metrology will ensure that we can confidently compare the performance metrics of a given transcription factor between laboratories, which sets the stage for predicting performance of a bespoke transcriptional program prior to construction. In brief, our metrology consists of three parts: (i) defining the conditional units of measurement for a given transcription factor, (ii) reproducible realization of these units at steady-state, (iii) performance traceability via the comparison of the performance metrics of a given transcription factor to a reference system. We begin this metrology via the development of performance cards for each of the transcription factors developed or used in this study (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref> and Supplementary Note.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). On the front of the card we display the complete engineered system and the putative phenotypic mechanism. In addition, the front of the card summarizes the contextual performance metrics for each system (i.e., normalized repression strength and fold induction), plus the relative performance to a reference standard (i.e., I<sup>+</sup><sub>YQR</sub> paired with the DNA operator O<sup>1</sup>; &#x000b1;10&#x02009;mM IPTG) to establish traceability. The back of a given card displays the operator position, microbe chassis, relevant genetic elements and related information. Collectively, this represents a standardized set of 55 unit operations. Recent studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> have demonstrated the impact that genetic architecture can have on the regulatory properties of a given transcription factor, justifying the need for our standardization approach (which will aid in both benchmarking and reproducibility). While we found the dynamic range of the unit operations useful in this study, the proposed metrology will enable other end-users to systematically tune the performance of a given transcription factor system to meet individual needs. The estimated scale-out of our current programming edifice is represented by approximately 86,184 putative biomolecular systems for the master architecture, when complemented by our current set of engineered transcription factors (Supplementary Note.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">Supplementary Software 1</xref>, Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>). This estimate can be expanded further if we consider the practical possibility that multiple transcription factors can engage a single DNA operator (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c and <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). This study represents an important advance in synthetic biology via expanding biological computing capacity, and lays the foundation for the development of a nascent biological (non-natural) programming language.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Vector construction and reporter systems</title><p id="Par21">All chimeras were inserted into the pLacI plasmid (Novagen), which features a low copy number p15A origin, a chloramphenicol resistance marker, and the gene for the repressor regulated with a constitutive LacI promoter. The different RCDs were obtained as follows: GalS (Addgene #60773), FruR (Addgene #60768), RbsR (Addgene #60773) from the Swint-Kruse and Bennett Labs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, while GalR and CelR were gifts from the Collins lab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. The open reading frame for each respective gene was amplified via PCR and inserted into the pLacI vector using circular polymerase extension cloning (CPEC). Mutations to the DNA-binding domain were then introduced via routine site-directed mutagenesis using Phusion DNA polymerase with GC buffer (New England Biolabs). For the FruR variants, the traditional lacI promoter was replaced by the stronger lacIq promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>, which leads to a tenfold increase in protein production. This single nucleotide change was introduced via NEB Q5 Site Directed Mutagenesis (New England Biolabs) using the NEBaseChanger tool to design primers. For each repressor variant, the entire gene reading frame along with the promoter driving expression was sequenced in the forward and reverse direction (Eurofins Genomics) to verify all mutations and correct assembly. A reporter plasmid system was constructed starting with the pZS*22-sfGFP reported in Richards et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. This plasmid features a low copy number pSC101* origin of replication, and a kanamycin resistance marker. The region of the plasmid excluding the promoter and operator was PCR amplified, visualized on an Agarose Gel, and Gel Extracted (Qiagen). A small fragment containing the constitutive <italic>trc</italic> promoter (hybrid of trp and lacUV5 promoters), a 5-bp spacer segment, and the operator sequence was constructed via oligos (Eurofins Genomics) and placed into the pZS*22-sfGFP vector through CPEC. This is the same reporter system utilized by Rondon and Wilson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. For each operator variant, the region upstream of the reporter gene, along with the GFP reading frame was sequenced in the forward and reverse direction (Eurofins Genomics) to verify correct assembly.

The second operator was then introduced in the proximal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> position, 15&#x02009;bp downstream of the end of the &#x02212;10 hexamer (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). In order to prevent variations in gene output stemming from operator sequence identity, we employed and insulator part, specifically the self-cleaving ribozyme RiboJ, which has been shown to be an effective buffer against transfer-function variability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. RiboJ was inserted between the proximal promoter and the ribosome binding site to eliminate transfer-function variability due to the 5&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR). To build the parallel circuits, the GFP gene along with the rrnB T1 terminator was PCR amplified from the pZS*22-sfGFP plasmid, visualized on an agarose gel, and gel extracted (Qiagen). On this second copy of GFP, we used the strong pL promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup> as the scaffold and replaced the 18&#x02009;bp region between the &#x02212;35 (TTGACA) and &#x02212;10 (GATACT) hexamers with 18&#x02009;bp of an operator sequence. The second operator was then introduced in the proximal position, 15&#x02009;bp downstream of the end of the &#x02212;10 hexamer. Like the original reporter, we employed and insulator part, specifically the self-cleaving ribozyme RiboJ to prevent transfer-function variability stemming from differences in operator sequence. In order to avoid evolutionary instability due to homologous recombination, an engineered variant, RiboJ10<sup>50</sup> was used upstream of GFP to introduce sequence diversity, while maintaining function. This region (the promoter, operator, RiboJ and the ribosome binding site) was constructed via oligos and the three fragments were then combined via splicing by overlap extension (SOE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup> and introduced into the linearized form of the reporter plasmid described previously via CPEC. For each construct, the region upstream of the reporter gene (containing the promoter, operator, and insulator), along with the GFP reading frame was sequenced in the forward and reverse direction (Eurofins Genomics) to verify correct assembly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Transcription factor vehicles</title><p id="Par23">To introduce additional transcription factors (TF), a third plasmid bearing another LacI/GalR family chimera was created. A plasmid with an alternate selection marker and compatible origin of replication was needed and to this end, the AmpR coding region of pLS1 was PCR amplified, visualized on an agarose gel, and gel extracted (Omega). This was then combined with the X<sup>+</sup> coding region from pLacI via Splicing by Overlap Extension (SOE). Finally, the PBR322 origin of replication was PCR amplified from the pet28b vector (a gift from the Kane lab), visualized on an agarose gel, and gel extracted (Qiagen) and combined with the X<sup>+</sup> and AmpR coding regions via CPEC. This plasmid also uses the strong lacIq promoter to drive expression of the transcription factor and was then co-transformed along with the pLacI plasmid and the reporter plasmid for assaying. In the case that more than two TFs were needed for a Transcription Factor system, plasmids containing more than one open reading frame (ORF) needed to be constructed. First, a linearized form of the pLacI plasmid was created by amplifying a 3764-bp region of the plasmid, visualized on an agarose gel, and gel extracted (Qiagen) the fragment. Next, the ORF for another X<sup>+</sup> variant was PCR amplified from pSO and dpnI digested in order to remove any background template. The two were then combined using the NEBuilder HiFi kit (New England Biolabs). Similarly, a 3648-bp region of pSO was amplified, visualized on an agarose gel, and gel extracted (Qiagen) and combined with the ORF of a given X&#x02009;+&#x02009;from pLacI. The latter was dpnI digested and the two fragments were combined once again using the NEBuilder HiFi kit. This allowed for the introduction of up to four TFs to be simultaneously transformed along with the reporter plasmid into <italic>E. coli</italic>. For these plasmids, each Transcription Factor was sequenced independently along with their respective promoters to ensure proper assembly.

The plasmids were co-transformed and plated on LB agar with the appropriate antibiotics (chloramphenicol for pLacI, ampicillin for pSO, and kanamycin for the reporter plasmid). Microplate assays were performed as outlined by Richards et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Briefly, colonies were inoculated in 1&#x02009;mL of LB and grown overnight at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C shaking at 300&#x02009;rpm. After this initial growth period, cultures were diluted into 200uL wells in M9 minimal media supplemented with 0.2% casamino acids, 1&#x02009;mM Thiamine HCl and the appropriate antibiotics containing the appropriate effector ligand (all ligands in this work were used at a final concentration of 10&#x02009;mM, unless otherwise stated). Ligands used are as follows: IPTG (CAS 367&#x02013;93&#x02013;1, Thermo Fischer), <sc>d</sc>-Fucose (CAS 3615&#x02013;37&#x02013;0, Carbosynth), Cellobiose (CAS 528&#x02013;50&#x02013;7, Arcos Organics), <sc>d</sc>-Ribose (CAS 50&#x02013;69&#x02013;1 Arcos Organics), <sc>d</sc>-Fructose (CAS 57&#x02013;48&#x02013;7 Alfa Aesar). Each sample was aliquoted in six samples in a clear, sterile, conical-bottom 96-well plate (Fischer Scientific) and grown in a 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C shaker at 300&#x02009;rpm covered with a Breathe-Easier sealing membrane (Midwest Scientific) to prevent evaporation. After 20&#x02009;h, all wells were transferred to a black 96-well plate (COSTAR) for assaying and GFP fluorescence (ex. 485&#x02009;nm, em. 510&#x02009;nm, gain 50) and optical density (OD600) were measured using a Synergy HT plate reader (BioTek). Corrections for pathlength were made using OD900 and OD975 and the fluorescence values were normalized to the optical density and averaged across all biological replicates. For each operator variant, the maximum GFP expression was determined using the LacStop control plasmid. LacStop is a plasmid that contains the LacI coding sequence on the pLacI plasmid but includes a stop codon at positions 2 and 3 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Therefore, this plasmid produces no repressor while still exerting the metabolic load of a second plasmid; this LacStop control was used to determine the maximum expression that can be achieved by a given architecture and can therefore be used for normalization, see Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Statistical analysis for phenotype classification</title><p id="Par25">Phenotypes were determined by first comparing the mean GFP (fluorescent) output for <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12 biological replicates six trials each on two different days) in the presence and absence of inducer utilizing a student&#x02019;s t-test with unequal variances and allowing for unequal sample sizes. The significance level was set to 0.001 and a one-tailed test was used.
