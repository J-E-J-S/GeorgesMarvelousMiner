<italic>Streptomyces</italic> are Gram-positive soil bacteria harboring high GC-content chromosomes and are members of the largest genus of actinobacteria with over 900 described species (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). They have been prominent industrial strains given their ability to produce secondary metabolites, including antibiotics, immunosuppressants, antiparastics, antifungals and other value-added biochemical (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Such secondary metabolites are typically synthesized via a multi-step conversion of precursor molecules, such as CoA pool and amino acids, by multi-enzyme complexes encoded in secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Individual <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species generally encode more than thirty BGCs in their genomes, which have a vast potential to produce a diverse array of the secondary metabolites. However, their functions were found to be mostly &#x02018;silent&#x02019; under laboratory growth conditions (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Discovering novel bioactive compounds by activating silent BGCs in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> is therefore of major interest, motivated, in part, by the rapid rise in antibiotic-resistant pathogens. However, activation of the silent BGCs is limited by the lack of regulatory information leading to their expression. Such information is foundational to designing expression hosts for BGCs.</p><p>In recent decades, several high-throughput techniques have been developed and applied to a broad range of species to overcome the lack of regulatory information. For example, integration of differential RNA-Seq (dRNA-Seq), RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling data from <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> revealed 3570 transcription start sites (TSSs) with small RNAs, genome-wide promoter architecture, differentially expressed genes (DEGs)&#x000a0;and translational buffering for genes encoding secondary metabolism (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). These vast amounts of genetic resources could be employed for practical applications of <italic>Streptomyces</italic>. For instance, native gene expressions were optimized by the introduction of precise promoter sequences and 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (5&#x02032;-UTR) for transcriptional and translational regulation (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Also, dRNA-Seq of <italic>S. tsukubaensis</italic> NRRL18488 at two different time points enabled the identification of 8914 TSSs, including TSSs of the immunosuppressant FK506 biosynthetic gene cluster (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Despite other regulatory network studies (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), our knowledge is still limited by the lack of data. Another important industrial strain, <italic>Streptomyces clavuligerus</italic> ATCC 27064 is used for the production of &#x003b2;-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and &#x003b2;-lactam antibiotic cephamycin C (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Information on transcriptional and translational regulatory elements in the GC-rich <italic>S. clavuligerus</italic> genome is not available to understand the regulatory networks governing BGC activities. Here, we obtained the high-quality genome sequence of <italic>S. clavuligerus</italic> ATCC 27&#x000a0;064, and determined genome-wide TSSs. Then, RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling were additionally exploited to reveal fundamental regulatory elements for transcription and translation. This comprehensive analysis facilitates a new understanding of the regulation of BGC expression and thus accelerates rational strain engineering for the production of bioactive compounds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Strains and cell growth</title><p>
<italic>Streptomyces clavuligerus</italic> ATCC 27064 cells were inoculated from its 20% glycerol stock of spores to 50 ml of R5&#x02212;&#x000a0;liquid complex medium with 8 g of glass beads (3 &#x000b1; 0.3 mm diameter) in 250 ml of a baffled flask and grown at 30&#x000b0;C, 250 rpm. R5&#x02212;&#x000a0;medium consists of 103 g/l sucrose, 0.25 g/l K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 10.12 g/l MgCl<sub>2</sub>&#x000b7;6H<sub>2</sub>O, 10 gl/l glucose, 0.1 g/l casamino acids, 5 g/l yeast extract, 5.73 g/l TES (pH 7.2), 0.08 mg/l ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.4 mg/l FeCl<sub>3</sub>&#x000b7;6H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.02 mg/l CuCl<sub>2</sub>&#x000b7;2H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.02 mg/l MnCl<sub>2</sub>&#x000b7;4H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.02 mg/l Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>&#x000b7;10H<sub>2</sub>O and 0.02 mg/l (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>Mo<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub>&#x000b7;4H<sub>2</sub>O. The grown mycelium was diluted 1:100 and then transferred to the fresh R5&#x02212;&#x000a0;medium for the main culture. The main culture for DNA and RNA samples was grown at the same condition as described above. To stall the ribosome and form the cross-linking for the ribosome profiling samples, thiostrepton (Sigma) was added to cultures to a final concentration of 20 &#x003bc;M, which is comparable to the method of a previous study on <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> and high sensitivity to the drug (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;14</xref>). The cultures were subsequently incubated for 5 min at 30&#x000b0;C before harvesting. All main cultures except for genome sequencing were prepared for biological duplicates.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-2"><title>Genome sequencing library preparation and high-throughput sequencing</title><p>The harvested cells from the main culture were centrifuged and resuspended in 1 ml of fresh R5&#x02212;&#x000a0;medium.

The lysate was then centrifuged at 4&#x000b0;C, 3000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. The genomic DNA was prepared using genomic DNA extraction kit (Promega) as manufacturer's protocol. The extracted genomic DNA was used for construction of both PacBio genome sequencing library and Illumina short read sequencing library. For PacBio genome sequencing library, 5 &#x003bc;g of genomic DNA was used as input of the SMRTbell&#x02122;&#x000a0;Template Prep Kit (Pacific Biosciences) and the library was constructed as manufacturer's protocol. After removing fragments smaller than 20 kb by the Blue Pippin Size selection system (Sage Science), the library was sequenced using the PacBio RS II sequencing platform (Pacific Biosciences). For Illumina short read sequencing library, the genomic DNA was fragmented to &#x0223c;200 bp using Covaris (Covaris Inc.) with the following condition; Power 175, Duty factor 20%; C. burst 20; Time 20 s; Cycle 8 times. Then, the library was constructed from fragmented genomic DNA by using TruSeq DNA Sample preparation protocol (Illumina). The library was sequenced on the MiSeq v2 instrument (Illumina) with 50 bp read recipe.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-3"><title>
<italic>De novo</italic> genome assembly and genome annotation</title><p>
<italic>De novo</italic> genome assembly was conducted using the hierarchical genome assembly process workflow (HGAP, Version 2.3) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Then, we found total 91 conflicts between two results by mapping of Illumina sequencing reads to the assembled contigs from PacBio sequencing. Conflicts showed more than 72% frequency for Illumina reads were corrected as Illumina results and others were unchanged as PacBio results, which were verified by Sanger sequencing. Illumina reads were assembled to make the contigs by CLC genomics workbench (CLC bio) and mapped to the two assembled PacBio contigs to expand the sequence of both ends. By using the complete sequence as input, genes were annotated by latest updated version of NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Process (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Secondary metabolite BGCs were predicted from the annotated information by antiSMASH 4.0 (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), and combined with the BGCs obtained from previous studies (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-4"><title>dRNA-Seq library preparation and high-throughput sequencing</title><p>The harvested cells were washed with polysome buffer composed of 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH7.5), 140 mM NaCl and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Then, the cells were resuspended with 500 &#x003bc;l of lysis buffer composed of 0.3 M Sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 1% Triton X-100. The resuspended cells were frozen with liquid nitrogen, and then lysed by grinding using mortar and pestle. The powdered cells were thawed and separated by centrifugation at 4&#x000b0;C, 3000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected as the lysate. The samples at each sampling time point were immediately washed and lysed as described above, and the collected lysates were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C, and after all sampling was carried out, all samples from each time point were thawed on ice for RNA extraction. The RNA samples were purified from the lysate by phenol&#x02013;chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (Sigma), and precipitated by ice-cold 100% ethanol. This RNA samples were used for further library constructions for dRNA-Seq and RNA-Seq. To remove genomic DNA from the extracted RNA samples, the same amount of RNA samples of four different time points was pooled and treated by DNase I (2 &#x003bc;l of DNase I (NEB), 5 &#x003bc;l of 10 &#x000d7; DNase I buffer and 1 &#x003bc;l of SUPERase-In RNase Inhibitor (20 U/&#x003bc;l, Thermo scientific), and DEPC-treated water (Thermo scientific) in 50 &#x003bc;l reaction volume). After DNase I treatment by incubation at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h, the RNA samples were purified by phenol&#x02013;chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (Sigma)&#x000a0;and precipitated by ice-cold 100% ethanol. Integrity of DNase-treated RNAs were confirmed by gel electrophoresis. Then, rRNAs were removed from DNase I treated RNA sample by using Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit for Bacteria (Epicentre). The rRNA-removed RNA samples were purified by the ethanol precipitation. About 1.4 &#x003bc;g of rRNA-removed RNA was split into two samples for two different libraries that were incubated in 1 &#x000d7; RNA 5&#x02032;-polyphosphatase reaction buffer and 1 U of SUPERase-In at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h with (TAP+) or without (TAP&#x02212;) 1 U of RNA 5&#x02032;-polyphosphatase (tobacco acid pyrophosphatase, TAP). As TAP cleaves 5&#x02032;-triphosphate of the primary transcript to make 5&#x02032;-monophosphate, it was expected that TAP+ samples contain both primary and processed transcripts, and TAP&#x02212; samples contain only processed transcripts. After ethanol precipitation, 5 pmol of 5&#x02032; RNA adapter was ligated to RNA with T4 RNA ligase in 1 &#x000d7; RNA ligase buffer (Thermo scientific) by incubation at 37&#x000b0;C for 90 min. Then, 1.2 &#x000d7; of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) were added to the solution and purified twice to select the proper size of libraries with a ligated adapter. The first cDNA strand synthesis by reverse transcription was done by Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Scientific) with a reverse transcription primer according to the manufacturer's instruction, followed by adding 0.8 &#x000d7; of AMPure XP beads and purifying twice to collect the synthesized DNA. The second strand of cDNA was synthesized using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Scientific) with indexed primers. The reaction was monitored on a CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) and stopped at the beginning of the saturation point. The amplified sample was purified by adding 0.8 &#x000d7; of AMPure XP beads to obtain the final library. The constructed libraries were sequenced using the 100-bp single-end read recipe by an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (Illumina).</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-5"><title>Determination of TSSs</title><p>The sequencing results were de-multiplexed and processed by CLC genomics workbench. Total 12&#x000a0;938 538&#x02013;13 489 136 raw reads were generated for each replicate, and trimmed by their quality (Quality score: 0.05, maximum ambiguous nucleotides: 2), their adapter sequence (Action: Remove adapter, mismatch cost: 2, gap cost: 3, internal match minimum score: 9, end match minimum score: 9), and length (&#x0003e;15 bp). The trimming steps yielded 81.67&#x02013;86.70% of the raw reads. Total 4 607 972&#x02013;7 483 560 (43.56&#x02013;66.72%) reads with average read length of 100.86&#x02013;100.88 bp were uniquely mapped to the completed genome (mismatch cost: 2, insertion cost: 3, deletion cost: 3, length fraction: 0.9, similarity cost: 0.9&#x000a0;and ignore non-specific match), which were corresponding to 54- to 88-fold coverage. The mapped information was exported as bam file format, and 5&#x02032;-end of mapped reads at each genomic position were counted as TSS peak raw count. TSSs of <italic>S. clavuligerus</italic> were determined using custom perl scripts and manually curated as described previously (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Genomic position of 5&#x02032;-ends of all mapped reads from both TAP+/&#x02212; libraries were called and counted as the peak intensity of each position. To determine TSS, the peak with maximum intensity among the peaks of a sub-cluster was selected. First, peaks apart from less than 100 bp were clustered. Then, adjacent peaks with &#x0003c;10 standard deviation of their position in the same cluster were additionally sub-clustered. Low intensity peaks less than four counts were discarded to select the enriched peaks. As the 5&#x02032;-end of the processed RNAs are expected to abundantly locate the downstream of the TSS, peaks showing more than 2-fold intensity at the position in TAP+ than TAP&#x02212; condition were selected. Finally, peaks that were not presented in both duplicates were removed. Assigned peaks were further manual curated according to RNA-Seq profiles and peak intensities to determine the peak as a TSS. The &#x02212;10 motif was searched by MEME (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) among the extracted sequences from &#x02212;25 to +1 bp relative to the position of TSS for the different gene groups of the TSS category, COG function, spacer length and the selection of a potential regulon of sigma factors.

The samples were loaded onto illustra MicroSpin S-400 HR Columns (GE Healthcare), which were formerly washed three times with 500 &#x003bc;l of washing buffer composed of 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8, 250 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 mM EGTA and 1% Triton X-100. The column was centrifuged at 4&#x000b0;C for 2 min at 400 <italic>g</italic>, and the flow through was further purified by phenol&#x02013;chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. rRNA was removed by using Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit. The ribosome-protected RNA fragments (RPF) between 26 and 32 bp were separated by electrophoresis for 65 min at 200 V using 15% polyacrylamide TBE-urea gel (Invitrogen), and eluted in 400 &#x003bc;l of RNA gel extraction buffer composed of 300 mM sodium acetate pH 5.5, 1 mM EDTA and 0.25% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulphate. The samples were frozen for 30 min at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C then incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 4 h with gentle mixing. The eluted RNAs were isolated by ethanol precipitation and purified again with RNeasy MinElute Column (Qiagen). To dephosphorylate the samples, they were denatured for 90 s at 80&#x000b0;C and incubated for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C with 5 ml of 10 &#x000d7; T4 PNK buffer (NEB), 20 U of SUPERase-In and 10 U of T4 PNK (NEB). The dephosphorylated RNAs were purified by using RNeasy MinElute Column (Qiagen). The sequencing library was constructed with NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina (NEB) according to manufacturer's instructions. The final library of 150 bp was size-selected by gel electrophoresis for 90 min at 100 V using 2% agarose gel dyed with SYBR Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (Bio-Rad). The concentration of the final library was measured with Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen) and the size distribution was checked with Agilent 2200 TapeStation System (Agilent). The library was sequenced on the HiSeq2000 platform using the 50-bp single-end read recipe. The sequencing results were de-multiplexed and processed by CLC genomics workbench. Total 247 353 047&#x02013;307 178 979 raw reads were generated for each replicate, and trimmed by their quality (Quality score: 0.05, maximum ambiguous nucleotides: 2), their adapter sequence (Action: Remove adapter, mismatch cost: 2, gap cost: 3, internal match minimum score: 3, end match minimum score: 3) and length (&#x0003e;15 bp). The trimming steps yielded 94.22&#x02013;98.66% of the raw reads. Total 61 294 530 (19.95% of raw reads) to 89 419 567 (35.28% of raw reads) reads with average read length of 25.8&#x02013;29.58 bp were uniquely mapped to the completed genome (mismatch cost: 2, insertion cost: 3, deletion cost: 3, length fraction: 0.9, similarity cost: 0.9&#x000a0;and ignore non-specific match) which were corresponding to 185- to 305-fold coverage, respectively. The mapped information was exported as bam file format, and the number of mapped reads at each genomic position were counted as the read count. The RPF expression value of each gene was the sum of the number of reads within the gene, and normalized to DESeq2 and RPKM value (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="SEC3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="SEC3-1"><title>High-quality genome sequence identifies 58 secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters</title><p>A high-quality complete genome sequence is essential to define accurate bacterial transcription architecture and associated regulatory elements.

First, the pyrimidine-purine dinucleotide preference near TSSs was consistent with that of <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> and other bacteria (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Purine nucleotide content (A/G) was strongly preferred at TSSs (91.6%), whereas +2 and &#x02212;1 position from TSSs showed a high proportion of pyrimidine nucleotide content (T/C), T for 41.3% at the +2 position and C for 52.3% at the &#x02212;1 position, respectively (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Second, the &#x02212;10 motif (TANNNT) was also well conserved in 91.0% of total TSSs (2419 of 2659, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; MEME), whereas the &#x02212;35 motif (NTGAC) was less conserved in 60.4% of total TSSs (1607 of 2659, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; MEME) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). For TSSs having consensus &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 motifs (<italic>n</italic> = 1467), we calculated spacer length between the two motifs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Promoters with an 18&#x02013;19 nt spacer length were the most abundant, which is 1&#x000a0;or 2 nt longer than the optimal 17 nt spacer length of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, but similar to that of <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Interestingly, the second major peak was observed for the 12 nt spacer length. The &#x02212;10 motifs showed no difference (i.e.&#x000a0;TANNNT), whereas the &#x02212;35 motifs of the three groups (G1 for 12 nt, G2 for 18&#x02013;19 nt and G3 for all other lengths) were different according to their spacer lengths (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). The G2 group showed the &#x02018;TTGAC&#x02019; motif, which is one of the binding motifs of housekeeping sigma (&#x003c3;) factor HrdB in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The G1 group showed the &#x02018;TGTC&#x02019; motif, which was previously reported in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> and <italic>S. avermitilis</italic> for DNA damage-inducible promoters with 12 nt spacer (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Indeed, genes in the G1 group showed specific functional enrichment related to replication, recombination, and repair functions (L, 13.5%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). Moreover, &#x02212;35 motifs were diverse for different categories of TSSs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>) and COG functional categories of downstream genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3 and Dataset S5</xref>).</p><p>Specifically, antisense TSSs were located inside the ORF, which are highly likely to have a role in regulatory functions. They had the conserved &#x02018;TANNNT&#x02019; &#x02212;10 motif, which confirms that they are <italic>bona fide</italic> TSSs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). One specific feature of the promoters of antisense TSSs was a 3 nt periodic appearance of &#x02018;G&#x02019;, which is complementary to the 3 nt &#x02018;C&#x02019; periodicity of third base of codons in GC-rich <italic>S. clavuligerus</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). This suggests that the position of antisense TSS is closely dependent on the codon sequence context at the promoter region and the &#x02018;ANGNTG&#x02019; motif is the only possible motif that satisfies both the 3 nt &#x02018;G&#x02019; periodicity and conserved &#x02018;ANNNT&#x02019; motif. Meanwhile, dispersive positions of antisense TSSs within genes were observed and there is no specific bias for the region of the codon within CDS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). These features might reflect the variability in the target region within CDS and its regulation mechanisms (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Alternatively, the transcripts from antisense TSSs might involve non-functional RNAs, which are the products of transcriptional noise owing to the dependency of transcription initiation on the genomic AT content of spurious promoters in the GC-rich genome (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-3"><title>Promoter motifs predict the regulons regulated by a diverse set of &#x003c3;-factors</title><p>The &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 motifs are the promoter elements that are mainly recognized by &#x003c3;-factors. This interaction is followed by the recruitment of the RNA polymerase holo&#x02013;enzyme complex to the promoter region to initiate transcription (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Since the &#x02212;35 motifs were diverse, the differential interaction between the &#x02212;35 motifs and various &#x003c3;-factors or transcription factors in a sequence-dependent manner was expected, resulting in the complex transcription regulations of morphological differentiation and synthesis of various secondary metabolites in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The number of &#x003c3;-factors in the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> genomes were particularly large compared to other bacterial species (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Forty one genes were annotated as &#x003c3;-factors in <italic>S. clavuligerus</italic>, which were expected to play different roles in response to various environmental stimuli. Each &#x003c3;-factor was expected to bind to its cognate promoter element (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Thus, the transcription of genes with promoters having consensus &#x02212;35 motif are potentially controlled by the common &#x003c3;-factor.</p><p>To predict the potential regulon, all promoters were scanned for matches to the motifs of each &#x003c3;-factor (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 for FIMO; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 for MEME) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>&#x000a0;and Dataset S6). For example, the &#x02212;35 motif of CRV15_09470 was almost identical to that of the G1 group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>) and COG L functional group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Also, the enriched gene function was highly correlated with DNA replication, recombination, and repair (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). There are two possible interpretations; (i) Since the &#x003c3;-factor usually binds to its own promoter for auto-regulation (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), the genes having the same &#x02212;35 motif are the members of same regulon of CRV15_09470, or (ii) other &#x003c3;-factors may bind to the promoters, including the promoter of CRV15_09470. In both cases, CRV15_09470 is considered to be involved in the regulon related to DNA replication, recombination and repair functions. The &#x02212;35 motif including CRV15_24810 was &#x02018;TCTCCGCGNGGANGG&#x02019;, and the functions of some genes were related to arginine metabolism (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This regulon is highly likely to be related to clavulanic acid biosynthesis because one of its main precursors is arginine (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The &#x02212;35 motif (GGGAACCC) includes CRV15_08465, which is annotated as &#x003c3;-factor E, and several genes in this regulon were related to peptidase and CoA-related functions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). This motif was also comparable to &#x02018;GGAAC&#x02019;, which is previously known to be the universal motif of the ECF family of &#x003c3;-factors for stress responses (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Therefore, CRV15_08465 might be related to changes in the cellular status by peptidase in response to certain stresses. Lastly, CRV15_10010, potentially encoding another &#x003c3;-factor, was a member of another &#x02212;35 motif group (TTGCCCCCCG). Interestingly, this regulon is composed of transporter genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). The promoters of potential regulons of 18 &#x003c3;-factors were also analyzed, and their consensus &#x02212;35 motifs were all distinct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>).

To select the DEGs, we considered the median of all BGC genes at early exponential phase as the expression cutoff value by assuming that most genes for secondary metabolism were minimally expressed at early exponential phase (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). A total of&#x000a0;2934 genes out of 7076 protein-coding genes were determined as DEGs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The genes were divided by two large clusters, depending on the changes in expression levels from early exponential phase (E) to transition phase (T), late-exponential phase (L)&#x000a0;and stationary phase (S), which were cluster I with an increasing pattern (<italic>n</italic> = 1452) and cluster II with a decreasing pattern (<italic>n</italic> = 1482). While housekeeping &#x003c3;-factor HrdB (CRV15_05035) showed no significant expression change, 16 &#x003c3;-factors were differentially expressed including WhiG (CRV15_05790), ShbA (CRV15_09955) and SigG (CRV15_27220) in cluster I, and SigF (CRV15_07985) and HrdD (CRV15_16830) in cluster II.</p><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>The landscape of transcriptome and translatome.

The genes involved in cellular transport and metabolism, such as nucleotide (F), coenzyme (H), secondary metabolites (Q), inorganic ion (P), amino acid (E)&#x000a0;and carbohydrate (G) showed highly differential expression levels which were generally dynamic in response to the cellular growth. On the other hand, the genes involved in information storage or signal processing such as cell division (D), replication (L) and signal transduction (T) showed relatively constitutive expression levels which were essential at all growth phases. A total of&#x000a0;15 of 18 COG categories showed a higher proportion of cluster II genes than cluster I, indicating that most of the transcripts were decreased at later phases due to slower growth. Notably, secondary metabolism related genes (Q) showed a particularly high proportion of cluster I, which is consistent with the previous studies in various growth conditions (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Indeed, 10 of 13 BGCs showed a higher proportion of genes upregulated at later phases (cluster I) than down-regulated (cluster II), except ectoine, siderophore and beta-lactam (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Most DEGs of siderophore type BGCs showed lower expression at later phases than early exponential phase, which might cause a decrease of cellular iron concentration. The opposite tendency between the expression of siderophore BGC and most of the other BGCs agrees with previous reports that iron limitation usually activates secondary metabolite production (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Among the DEGs, translation machinery genes (J) showed mostly downregulated expression levels at later phases (cluster II) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-5"><title>Ribosome profiling shows significant reduction of translation efficiency at late growth phases</title><p>The ratio of RPF over RNA (RPF/RNA ratio) of all genes was calculated for four growth phases, revealing that the overall protein synthesis efficiency was significantly decreased at later phases compared to early exponential phase (Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, ***<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, two-sided) due to the limited availability of translation machinery (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Additionally, the relationship between changes in RNA transcript levels and changes in the RPF/RNA ratio represented a global negative correlation for all three later phases compared to early exponential phase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). Interestingly, 694 genes showed &#x02018;translational buffering&#x02019; (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) that had a substantially decreasing RPF/RNA ratio despite increasing RNA, indicated in the yellow box of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>. 220 of 694 (31.7%) genes were located in BGCs, which is a significantly higher ratio compared to the number of BGC genes in the total genome (1539 of 7076, 21.7%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>). This means that most of the genes in secondary metabolism were translationally buffered even though their transcript levels were increased compared to other genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">F</xref>).</p><p>Next, we sought to integrate the two datasets with dRNA-Seq in order to determine the genome annotation of transcripts with internal TSSs. There are two possibilities for the presence of internal TSSs; (i) they are non-coding regulatory RNAs or (ii) they are actually alternative TSSs of distinct ORFs located downstream from the TSSs. The relative position of internal TSSs within the ORF was biased toward the 5&#x02032;-end of the ORF, which suggests that later cases might be more abundant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7A</xref>). Indeed, RNA read density as well as RPF read density showed increasing patterns at the downstream of internal TSSs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7B</xref>). For example, CRV15_06880 (1,371 bp), a gene encoding sugar ABC transporter substrate-binding protein gene, had an internal TSS located at the +167 bp position (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7C</xref>). The RNA transcript and RPF profile of this gene starts at the downstream of the internal TSS, and a downstream in-frame GTG codon was found in the functional domain. Also, the &#x02018;NTTGAC&#x02019; &#x02212;35 motif, &#x02018;TANNNT&#x02019; &#x02212;10 motif, 18 nt spacer and &#x02018;GGAGG&#x02019; SD sequence were found near this TSS. These results indicate that this internal TSS is the primary TSS of a new downstream ORF, which was previously mis-annotated. All other internal TSSs were also classified into three cases, including (i) transcript of the downstream ORF starting from the downstream location of the TSS indicating the original ORF is misannotated; (ii) transcripts of alternative downstream ORFs to the original ORF; and (iii) non-coding transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Dataset S8</xref>). It is thought that the original ORF was potentially misannotated if there was no ribosome binding at the region between the start codon of the original ORF and internal TSS. To quantify the ribosome binding at the region, ribosome profiling reads at each relative position from the first nucleotide of the start codon were calculated (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). As a result, 45 of 155 internal TSSs were classified as TSSs of corrected ORFs from misannotation, 4 TSSs that did not have any possible downstream ORF were classified as the TSS of non-coding transcripts and the remaining 106 of 155 internal TSSs were classified as the TSSs of transcripts of alternative downstream ORFs. Notably, 27 of 45 transcripts of the corrected ORFs and 25 of 106 transcripts of alternative downstream ORFs were leaderless. Moreover, we predicted functional differences between original and new ORFs by pfam analysis (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). As a result, 2 of 45 corrected ORFs and 23 of 106 transcripts of alternative downstream ORFs showed different domain hits. Therefore, the integrative analysis of the transcriptome and translatome revealed a dynamic transcriptional landscape, translational buffering of secondary metabolism, novel ORFs and accurate gene annotations.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-6"><title>Transcription start sites define regulatory elements encoded in 5&#x02032;-UTRs</title><p>5&#x02032;-UTRs encode transcriptional and translational regulatory elements such as ribosome binding sites, riboswitches and others (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). First, 5&#x02032;-UTR length distribution was calculated from primary TSSs (<italic>n</italic> = 1869) of protein-encoding genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). The median length of 5&#x02032;-UTRs was 53 nt, which is comparable to the average 5&#x02032;-UTR lengths of other bacteria; however, it was 9 nt longer than <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45&#x02013;46</xref>). A significant portion of 5&#x02032;-UTRs (<italic>n</italic> = 433) represented leaderless mRNA (lmRNA), whose 5&#x02032;-UTR lengths are shorter than 9 nt. This proportion of lmRNA is 4% higher compared to other actinobacteria (19.1% lmRNA on average) (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). The absence of 5&#x02032;-UTR (5&#x02032;-UTR length = 0 nt) was observed in 92.8% of lmRNAs (402 of 433). Interestingly, 351 of 1869 5&#x02032;-UTRs (18.8%) have lengths longer than 150 nt, indicating the presence of potential riboswitches for regulatory functions. This result led us to classify transcription units based upon 5&#x02032;-UTR lengths; 0&#x02013;9 nt for lmRNAs, 10&#x02013;149 nt for &#x02018;moderate-leadered mRNA&#x02019; (mmRNA, <italic>n</italic> = 1085), and longer than 150 nt for &#x02018;extended-leadered mRNA&#x02019; (emRNA, <italic>n</italic> = 351). The lmRNA showed a higher preference of AUG start codon usage (80.0%) than other groups (60.7% for mmRNA, and 61.0% for emRNA) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). The RPF/RNA ratio of each gene, which utilizes AUG as a start codon in total genes and lmRNA genes, suggests a higher translational initiation rate for the AUG start codon than for other start codons (Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, **<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01 and ***<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, two-sided) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Transcriptional and translational elements downstream from primary TSS.

In contrast, lmRNA showed the &#x02018;TANNNT&#x02019; motif, which is the conserved &#x02212;10 motif of the promoter as expected (97.9% (424 of 433), <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; MEME). As the interaction between fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> and 5&#x02032;-AUG is the unique ribosome binding signal without SD-aSD interaction on lmRNA (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), the determinant of differential translation efficiency would be the downstream RNA structure of 5&#x02032;-AUG.

This suggests that lmRNAs have less structured RNA for efficient translation without 5&#x02032;-UTRs.

Overall, sucrose, which is the main carbon source of R5&#x02212; medium, was converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and arginine for precursors of clavulanic acid, and lysine, valine and cysteine for precursors of cephamycin C, respectively. For glycolysis pathway, the genes governing conversion from GAP to acetyl CoA were generally downregulated under later growth phases than early exponential phase (15 of 22 genes, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, DESeq2). Likewise, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) genes for adenosine triphosphate synthesis were also downregulated through growth phases (16 of 26 genes, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, DESeq2). These results suggest that cellular metabolism changed to precursor production for secondary metabolism rather than energy production. Interestingly, the genes involved in clavulanic acid and cephamycin C BGC showed significantly higher expression levels for all growth phases than other BGC genes (Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, two-sided), even among 45 of 58 BGCs that were potentially &#x02018;expressed&#x02019; under the culture condition of this study, which showed a higher transcription level median of at least at one growth phase than the total BGC gene median at the early exponential phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S9-10 and Dataset S7</xref>). However, expression levels of genes related to the conversion from aspartate to lysine were downregulated at later growth phases (10 of 19 genes, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, DESeq2), which may be the rate-limiting factor of cephamycin C biosynthesis. Moreover, the genes involved in the arginine biosynthetic pathway showed similar expression patterns that decrease at transition and late-exponential phases (13 of 17 genes, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, DESeq2). These results suggest that a number of genes involved in the same metabolic pathways may be regulated by a common &#x003c3;-factor. To find the potential common regulon, enriched &#x02212;35 motifs were searched for the promoter of genes involved in &#x003b2;-lactam BGCs (<italic>n</italic> = 86) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).

One is the &#x02018;GAAGANNNNNNNNAG&#x02019; motif, with two clavulanic acid BGC genes (<italic>ceaS2</italic> and <italic>claR</italic>), two cephamycin C BGC genes (<italic>lat</italic> and <italic>blp</italic>), pyruvate dehydrogenase (<italic>aceE</italic>), and a valine biosynthesis gene (<italic>ilvC</italic>) involved (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>).

Seven of nine genes showed similar expression patterns decreasing at transition and late-exponential phases, reflecting common transcription regulation.

Newly annotated genes with the BGC information revealed that the <italic>S. clavuligerus</italic> genome contained an unprecedented large number of BGCs compared to other <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). About half of the 58 BGCs were located in the 1.8-Mb mega-plasmid, which were likely gained by horizontal gene transfer or recombination from the chromosome (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Also, the protein-coding genes in this plasmid were predicted to be non-essential for primary metabolism (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>Genome-wide TSS information facilitated the precise investigation of global transcription and translation regulatory elements in the <italic>S. clavuligerus</italic> genome. Base composition at the TSS region was comparable to other species in that purine was rich at +1, and pyrimidine was rich at &#x02013;1 and +2. It was consistent with the structural study that the base stacking interaction between purine base at the &#x02013;1 position of non-template DNA and purine base at the +1 position of RNA is one of the essential factors for transcription initiation with the abundance of pyrimidine base at the +2 position of RNA (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Although a higher proportion of cytidine than thymine at the &#x02013;1 position is reasonable due to the high GC content, it is notable that the proportion of thymine was higher than cytidine at the +2 position. This might be the outcome of additional interactions between the base composition and transcription initiation complex. Another distinct transcriptional element was the abundance of the &#x02018;TGTC&#x02019; &#x02013;35 motif with 12-bp spacer length that was related to DNA replication, recombination and repair functions. Since those functions are essential for maintaining self-replicable life, it is reasonable to have distinct motifs and the cognate &#x003c3;-factor for tight regulation. For example, the CRV15_09470 gene contained the &#x02013;35 motif in the promoter region and was predicted to encode the ECF family &#x003c3;-factor having the &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub> and &#x003c3;<sub>4</sub> domain by Pfam (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Remarkably, an additional SnoaL_2 domain was predicted at the C-terminal region, which was also reported in &#x003c3;<sub>J</sub> of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). This domain was structurally similar to the domain in polyketide cyclase, expoxide hydrolase and ketosteroid isomerases. Structural and biochemical features of &#x003c3;<sub>J</sub> suggested that the domain could modulate the conformation of &#x003c3;<sub>J</sub> in the absence of a cognate anti-&#x003c3; factor, resulting in changes of the DNA binding specificity in response to the external signals (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Therefore, the &#x003c3;-factor may bind to the distinct motif due to its unique structure in response to certain cellular signals for tight regulation of essential gene expression.</p><p>In addition to the &#x02018;TGTC&#x02019; motif, a wide variety of &#x02013;35 motifs were observed, which may be important determinants for various &#x003c3;-factor interactions with the cognate promoters. As the &#x003c3;<sub>4</sub> domain directly binds to the &#x02013;35 element, the structural difference of the &#x003c3;<sub>4</sub> domain among &#x003c3;-factors could generate different DNA binding specificity (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). However, it is ambiguous to assign one cognate &#x003c3;-factor to one cognate &#x02013;35 motif due to the flexibility of &#x003c3;-factor binding to the promoter sequences (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). For example, the &#x02013;35 motif of the housekeeping HrdB regulon of <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> revealed by ChIP-seq was not enriched as one specific sequence (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Other determinants such as the extended &#x02013;10 element, UP element and &#x02013;10 element may compensate for the weak interaction of the &#x02013;35 motif with various &#x003c3;-factors (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Also, additional transcription factors may cooperate with &#x003c3;-factors to alter their binding interaction (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Even though extensive autoregulation of &#x003c3;-factors to their own promoters was observed (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), other &#x003c3;-factors may bind to the promoter instead of the cognate &#x003c3;-factor itself, such as ShbA binding to the <italic>hrdB</italic> promoter in <italic>Streptomyces griseus</italic> (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Nevertheless, the promoters with similar &#x02013;35 and &#x02013;10 motifs have the potential to be regulated by identical &#x003c3;-factors. Therefore, the investigation of potential common regulons regulated by a &#x003c3;-factor could be a valuable resource to understand the complex transcriptional regulatory network of secondary metabolism.</p><p>Next, the global analysis of the 5&#x02032;-UTRs revealed the abundance of lmRNA in <italic>S. clavuligerus</italic>. lmRNAs were universally observed among broad species, and their proportion was conserved among phylogenetically close species (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Thus, they are considered as an evolutionarily ancient translation mode due to the lack of translational machinery such as 5&#x02032;-UTR and r-proteins (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), but also as a regulatory system for some cases such as kasugamycin resistance (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Neither functional enrichment nor a remarkable trend of RNA, RPF, and RPF/RNA ratios were observed. Instead, lmRNA was less structured at the start codon region than mmRNA or emRNA, suggesting that the 5&#x02032;-UTR might be obtained for efficient translational regulation during evolution.</p><p>At last, the transcriptome landscape of the &#x003b2;-lactam biosynthetic pathway provided an understanding of the metabolic changes and potential common regulons. According to differential transcription levels of the genes in our culture conditions, lysine and arginine biosynthesis were downregulated at later growth phases, which might be the rate-limiting step of cephamycin C and clavulanic acid biosynthesis, respectively. Among the second potential common regulon genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>), <italic>argC</italic> and <italic>argG</italic> are the first genes of two polycistronic transcription units, which are <italic>argCJBDF</italic> and <italic>argGH</italic> (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). They were known to be negatively regulated by ArgR binding to ARG box, which is located at the promoter including the &#x02013;35 motif region (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). However, other genes in the same regulon such as <italic>pdhA</italic> and <italic>gltA</italic> were not known as ArgR targets. Thus, other &#x003c3;-factors may regulate those genes instead of ArgR.</p><p>In conclusion, the integration of a high-quality genome sequence with 58 potential BGCs and transcriptome landscape revealed the genome-wide transcriptional and translational regulatory elements of <italic>S. clavuligerus</italic> ATCC 27064. This information will improve the understanding of complex regulatory networks in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> BGCs. Furthermore, detailed studies of diverse promoter elements, &#x003c3;-factors, and their regulons will establish the foundation of rational engineering for the activation of silent BGCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="SEC5"><title>DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>Genome sequencing raw reads can be found at the National Center for Biotechnology Information as BioProject PRJNA414136.
