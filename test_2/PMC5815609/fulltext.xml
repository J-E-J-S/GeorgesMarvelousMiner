Contrary to coding genes however, which can be functionally knocked out by frame-shift mutagenesis, non-coding RNA (ncRNA) gene knockouts have remained challenging. Here we present a universal ncRNA knockout approach guided by epigenetic hallmarks, which enables robust gene silencing even in provisionally annotated gene loci. We build on previous work reporting the presence of overlapping histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) and DNaseI hypersensitivity sites around the transcriptional start sites of most genes. We demonstrate that excision of this gene-proximal signature leads to loss of microRNA and lincRNA transcription and reveals ncRNA phenotypes. Exemplarily we demonstrate silencing of the constitutively transcribed MALAT1 lincRNA gene as well as of the inducible miR-146a and miR-155 genes in human monocytes. Our results validate a role of miR-146a and miR-155 in negative feedback control of the activity of inflammation master-regulator NF&#x003ba;B and suggest that cell-cycle control is a unique feature of miR-155. We suggest that our epigenetically guided CRISPR approach may improve existing ncRNA knockout strategies and contribute to the development of high-confidence ncRNA phenotyping applications.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009103</institution-id><institution>Von-Behring-R&#x000f6;ntgen-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>vBR project 63-0036</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6814-9344</contrib-id><name><surname>Schulte</surname><given-names>Leon N.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Forschungsf&#x000f6;rderfonds (Philipps-Universit&#x000e4;t Marburg)</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6814-9344</contrib-id><name><surname>Schulte</surname><given-names>Leon N.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by von Behring-R&#x000f6;ntgen-Stiftung (vBR project 63-0036, to L.N.S.) and Forschungsf&#x000f6;rderfonds, Philipps Universit&#x000e4;t Marburg (to L.N.S).

Meanwhile ncRNAs have been implicated in transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of major cellular processes, ranging from cell-cycle progression to lineage commitment and immune-responses. While microRNAs exhibit a size range of 20&#x02013;22 nt and regulate gene expression through translational repression and destabilization of target transcripts [<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are less uniform in function. By definition, lncRNAs are &#x0003e; 200 nt in size and lack coding sequences (CDS). LncRNAs have been suggested to interact with proteins to function e.g. as decoys, scaffolds or guides [<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and can be found both the nucleus and the cytosol.</p><p>For decades ncRNA loss-of-function studies in mammals were limited to small animal models. The discovery of Cas9 as an RNA-programmable DNA nuclease has enabled gene knockouts in human cells at low cost, opening a new chapter in genetics [<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. While functional knockouts of coding-genes are typically achieved though frame-shifting mutations within the CDS, little consensus exists regarding CRISPR/Cas9-strategies for silencing of non-coding RNA genes. Due to the lack of a CDS only in rare cases point-mutations within critical ncRNA regions can be expected to abrogate gene function.</p><p>Recently, functional ncRNA gene knockouts have been achieved by integration of RNA destabilizing elements [<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] or excision of assumed promoter regions and exons by guiding Cas9 to two independent sites flanking the DNA sequence to be excised [<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This strategy has generally proven itself successful, however, genomic deletions might affect neighbouring genes due to changes in local chromatin structure or redirection of the activity of distal enhancers. Furthermore, the provisional status of current ncRNA gene annotations may render it difficult to select essential promoter or exon regions to be knocked out. In the present work we introduce an approach, enabling ncRNA gene knockouts through excision of a defined transcriptional start site signature even in provisionally annotated loci, guided by epigenetic data.</p><p>Accessibility of eukaryotic genes for polymerases and transcription factors depends on the local chromatin condensation state, which is dynamically regulated through histone acetylation, methylation or phosphorylation marks. Histone H3-acetylation at lysine residues K9 and K27 (H3K9ac and H3K27ac) for instance is found in active gene regions, whereas tri-methylation of the same residues (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3) is a hallmark of transcriptionally repressed chromatin. However, histone methylation does not always lead to local chromatin silencing. H3K4me1 for instance marks active enhancers, while transcriptional start-sites (TSS) of active genes typically carry H3K4me3 tags. Gene-proximal H3K4me3 marks typically coincide with DNaseI hypersensitivity sites (HSS), indicative of accessible chromatin [<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Overlaying DNaseI HSS and H3K4me3 ChIP-Seq data provides a means to identify the core TSS regions of human genes [<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], even in provisionally annotated genomic regions.</p><p>Systematic mapping of chromatin modifications by the ENCODE project has established detailed histone modification maps in diverse human cell types. Here we made use of these publically available data to identify TSSs of microRNA and lncRNA genes for targeted excision by CRISPR/Cas9. We hypothesized that knockout of the TSS-associated DNaseI/H3K4me3 signature terminates ncRNA gene transcription. We evaluated our strategy exemplarily for one constitutively transcribed ncRNA gene (MALAT1), one obligate inducible ncRNA gene (miR146aHG) and one base-line expressed inducible ncRNA gene (miR155HG). MALAT1 is a highly expressed lncRNA, which has been implicated in diverse cellular processes such as alternative splicing, cell cycle progression and metastasis [<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. MiR-155 and miR-146a on the other hand have been described as regulators of inflammatory responses elicited on sensing of molecular pathogen signatures by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). A prototypic example for pattern recognition is the sensing of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by the PRR Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which triggers inflammatory gene expression through transcription factors such as NF&#x003ba;B, AP1 and IRF1-9. In mononuclear phagocytes, which are key players in mammalian antimicrobial immunity, miR-146 and miR-155 have been shown to confer negative-feedback control within PRR signalling [<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, miR-155 has also been suggested to promote inflammation under certain conditions [<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193066.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], therefore its role in the human innate immune response has remained controversial.</p><p>Here we show that excision of proximal DNaseI/H3K4me3 marks silences both inducible and constitutively transcribed ncRNA genes in human cells. Our results suggest a primary role of miR-146a and miR-155 but not MALAT1 in feed-back control or PRR-NF&#x003ba;B signalling in human monocytes and positive control of G2/M cell cycle phase accumulation as a unique function of miR-155. Our approach establishes a robust workflow for ncRNA gene silencing with minimal genome sequence alteration and may improve current CRISPR libraries for systematic loss-of-function screenings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cell culture</title><p>U937 monocytes and Hek293 cells (ATCC) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Thermo Fisher), supplemented with 10% FBS (Biochrom) and 1% penicillin / streptomycin solution (Thermo Fisher).

Therefore, systematic deletion of these signatures might enable robust ncRNA phenotypic screening. To provide proof-of-concept for the identification of ncRNA phenotypes using our knockout procedure we carried out computational predictions followed by wet-lab experimental validations using the ncRNA knockout cells generated above.</p><p>To narrow down experimental assays for phenotype identification we predicted miR-146a, miR-155 and MALAT1 functions by co-expression network analysis. To this end, 45 published datasets from control- and immune-stimulated mononuclear phagocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0193066.s009">S2 Table</xref>) were mined for co-expressed mRNAs, which were subjected to KEGG pathway and transcriptional network analysis. In line with the known roles of miR-146a and miR-155 our predictions implicated both microRNAs in inflammatory gene expression downstream of PRRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0193066.s004">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>). MiR-146 has been extensively characterized as a TLR negative feedback regulator. On the other hand, it had remained debated, whether miR-155 primarily promotes or limits inflammatory responses downstream of PRR activation [<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193066.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Our computational analysis furthermore predicted miR-155 but not miR-146a to be associated with cell-cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0193066.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). MALAT1 co-regulated genes on the other hand displayed only weak functional associations, and &#x0201c;Transcriptional misregulation in cancer&#x0201d; was the only identified KEGG pathway term (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0193066.s004">S4C Fig</xref>). To address our predictions experimentally we monitored phosphorylation of NF&#x003ba;B and ERK1/2, which occurs downstream of TLR4 activation, and carried out cell cycle and apoptosis assays with control-treated and LPS-activated wild-type and knockout monocytes.</p><p>As a measure for the transcriptional activity of NF&#x003ba;B we determined changes in Ser592 phosphorylation of the p65 subunit by intracellular staining and flow-cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193066.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Importantly, NF&#x003ba;B p65 phosphorylation was significantly elevated in both miR-146a and miR-155 deficient cells compared to wild-type cells at 30 and 100 min post onset of the LPS-stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193066.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>, middle and right panel). In MALAT1 deficient cells however NF&#x003ba;B p65 phosphorylation was indistinguishable from wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193066.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>, left panel). This suggests that both miR-146a and miR-155 but not MALAT1 act as negative feedback regulators of TLR-NF&#x003ba;B signalling and confirms our previous results with murine cells [<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In a similar FACS-based assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193066.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>) no impact of MALAT1, miR-146a or miR-155 ablation on LPS-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193066.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>). Thus, the increased phosphorylation of NF&#x003ba;B in miR-146a and miR-155 deficient cells does not represent a generalized effect on TLR4-mediated signalling cascades. Furthermore, confirming our predictions, knockout of miR-155 but not miR-146a lead to a substantial shift of monocytes out of G2/M and into G1/G0 cell cycle phase compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193066.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>), in line with the known implications of miR-155 in cancer [<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. No effect of MALAT1 knockout on the cell-cycle was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193066.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>), despite its classification as a cancer-related gene [<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, apoptosis rates as determined by AnnexinV-staining were similar in all cell clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0193066.s006">S6 Fig</xref>), suggesting that none of the examined ncRNAs is specifically involved in cell death and ruling out broad side-effects of our CRIPSR approach on cell viability. In summary our ncRNA knockout method validates both miR-146a and miR-155 as negative feed-back regulators of the pro-inflammatory TLR-NF&#x003ba;B axis in human monocytes.

While previous strategies have relied on individual determination of essential gene regions we demonstrate that excision of DNaseI/H3K4me3 signatures, which constitute universal TSS hallmarks, is sufficient to confer robust gene silencing.</p><p>As a general note of precaution, excision of genomic DNA segments may affect expression of neighbouring genes. In the case of bidirectional transcription for instance, deletion of promoter segments may silence transcription from both DNA strands, rendering it difficult to assign an observed phenotype to one specific transcript. We believe, that our approach minimizes those non-specific effects by excising a strand-specific TSS element rather that the entire promoter. Nevertheless, unwanted side-effects on transcription of neighbouring elements must be ruled out experimentally in any case where multiple transcripts originate from the same genomic locus. Furthermore, off-target effects of the guideRNAs used to ablate the TSS of a gene must be considered as well as targeting of unrelated TSSs. Our computational analysis suggests that TSS regions are underrepresented among guideRNA off-target sequences, in line with the relatively small fraction of the human genome sequence being occupied by TSS [<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Nevertheless, careful evaluation of the selected guideRNAs (see step-by-step protocol) and exclusion of guideRNA pairs with shared off-target sites in proximity to a gene sequence is recommended. In addition, high ranking predicted off-targets may be amplified by genomic PCR and analysed for mutations by Sanger sequencing, as exemplarily carried out for the ncRNA knockout constructs used in the present study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0193066.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). In our case no off-target mutations in the inspected off-target loci were observed.</p><p>While this manuscript was in preparation a study by Pulido-Quetglas et al. suggested that deletion of lncRNA enhancer elements may reduce downstream gene expression [<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This strategy however may be less universally applicable since enhancers may be located far away from the gene proximal promoter and thus hard to assign exclusively to a given gene. Furthermore, enhancers may give rise to functional lncRNAs themselves [<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and therefore their deletion might provoke additional effects uncoupled from the silencing of immediate downstream genes. We predict that side effects, inherent to every CRISPR-based gene knockout method, are less likely to occur with our targeted TSS excision approach than with large promoter or enhancer deletions. Furthermore, Engreitz et al. recently showed that lincRNA promoter deletions reduce lncRNA expression more effectively than individual intron, exon or splice-site deletions [<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Still, due to the frequent bidirectional and overlapping transcription in mammalian genomes, many genes might not be suited for CRISPR-based loss-of-function experiments [<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In those cases, antisense-inhibition approaches using RNAi or Gapmer technology may stay the primary methods of choice and in any case phenotypes obtained through CRISPR/Cas9 based approaches should be validated using independent methods. We suggest, that our improved ncRNA knockout strategy may be primarily used in intergenic ncRNA loss-of-function experiments, where a given TSS can be unambiguously assigned to one individual gene. Recently, thousands of intergenic long non-coding RNA genes (lincRNAs, including many microRNA host-genes) have been identified in the human genome [<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and most of those genes are still of unknown function. We believe that our method can make a significant contribution to the functional characterization of this major ncRNA contingent of the human transcriptome.</p><p>Exemplarily we have knocked out the constitutively expressed MALAT1 gene and the TLR-inducible genes miR146HG and miR155HG. Our observations suggest a primary function of both miR-146a and miR-155 in negative feedback control of NF&#x003ba;B signalling in human cells. This confirms previous observations reported by us and others [<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193066.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, miR-155 has also been suggested to promote inflammatory responses through inhibition of SOCS1 and SHIP1 [<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0193066.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. While we cannot rule out that miR-155 may exert both feed-back and feed-forward control of TLR-signalling in a time- and stimulus-dependent manner or even simultaneously our observations suggest that the negative feedback function dominates in human monocytes. Interestingly, while the effect of both miRNA deletions on NF&#x003ba;B p65 phosphorylation was highly significant, the same trend was observed for IL1b, IL8 and CCL4 mRNA induction, however did not reach significance levels. This may indicate compensatory mechanisms acting on NF&#x003ba;B target genes when miR-146a and miR-155 feed-back regulation is absent, preventing from excessive immune gene activation. Furthermore, our observation that ERK1/2 phosphorylation is not affected by miR-146a or miR-155 ablation might indicate that these microRNAs primarily impact on the expression of genes which strictly depend on NF&#x003ba;B and are not co-regulated by the ERK-MAPK pathway. Finally, since we silenced the microRNA host genes the possibility of lincRNA functions independent of the miRISC pathway contributing to the observed phenotypes cannot be ruled out and should be addressed by future studies. The observation that MALAT1 knockout does not impact NF&#x003ba;B p65 phosphorylation or cell cycle progression confirms that our observations are not due to a general side-effect of the Cas9 enzyme on cellular immune responsiveness. On the other hand, the role of the highly abundant lncRNA MALAT1 in mononuclear phagocytes remains elusive, in line with other recent observations, reporting the absence of obvious phenotypes in MALAT1 deficient mice [<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193066.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>In summary, our ncRNA gene knockout approach using epigenetic information to narrow down essential TSS elements confers robust gene silencing. We provide proof-of-concept for the identification of ncRNA knockout phenotypes using well-established ncRNA loci. Besides improved generation of stable gene knockouts we suggest that our approach may complement existing CRISPR libraries for high-confidence intergenic non-coding RNA silencing in phenotypic screening assays.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0193066.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>RNA-Seq analysis of long intergenic non-coding RNA expression in human monocytes.</title><p>Plotted are average RPKMs across all conditions (Y-axis) and fold-changes (X-axis) of long intergenic non-coding RNA genes (including microRNA host-genes) derived from RNA-Seq analysis of monocytes either control-treated or stimulated with LPS, Listeria monocytogenes or LPS + Interferon-&#x003b3; (NCBI GEO data, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0193066.s009">S2 Table</xref>).
