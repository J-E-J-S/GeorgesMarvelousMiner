It has been reported that curcumin exerted anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-cancer effects in numerous <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. However, it is not well-understood the molecular mechanism of curcumin for the cancer stem cells and telomerase in colorectal cancer. In this study, compound 19, a nitrogen-containing curcumin analog, was used to treat human colorectal cancer cells. Compound 19 showed a greater anti-proliferative activity than curcumin while displayed no significant toxicity toward normal human colon epithelial cells. Compound 19 exerted anti-inflammatory activities by deactivating STAT3 and NF-&#x003ba;B. In cancer stem cell populations, CD44, Oct-4 and ALDHA1 expressions were abolished upon treating with compound 19. Cancer stem cell biomarkers CD51 and CD133 positive populations were reduced and telomerase activities were decreased with the reduced STAT3 binding to hTERT promoters. This means compound 19 dually inhibits canonical and non-canonical functions of telomerase. Furthermore, compound 19 treatments induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and apoptosis. Human apoptosis-related array screening revealed that activated caspase 3, catalase, clusterin and cytochrome C led to apoptosis. Taken together, our data suggest that compound 19 can be a novel therapeutic agent for metastatic colorectal cancer by concurrently targeting STAT3 and NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathways.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>curcumin analog</kwd><kwd>cancer stem cells</kwd><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>STAT3</kwd><kwd>NF-&#x003ba;B</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list list-type="simple" list-content="abbreviations"><def-item><term>CRC</term><def><p>colorectal cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CSC</term><def><p>cancer stem cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STAT3</term><def><p>signal transducer and activator of transcription 3</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NF-&#x003ba;B</term><def><p>nuclear factor &#x003ba;B</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>hTERT</term><def><p>human telomerase reverse transcriptase</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary></notes></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading mortality in the United States and fourth leading cause of cancer-related death globally [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. CRC mortality is primarily due to the metastatic progression, with the liver being the most frequent organ of metastatic colonization [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The 5-year survival rate of patients with CRC metastasis is less than 10% [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Current treatments of CRC include surgery and chemotherapy [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Standard chemotherapy of FOLFOX (5-Flurouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin) has been recommended for colon cancer patients at the stages II and III [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Unfortunately, patients frequently develop drug resistance against chemotherapy and metastasis leading to death within 5 years of diagnosis [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, there are significant unmet needs for the novel therapeutic regimen that can better treat CRC patients at a low risk of recurrence.</p><p>Curcumin is a substance in turmeric and known to have multiple biologically beneficial effects [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A number of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies revealed that curcumin has anti-cancer effects including colorectal cancer [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It has been reported that curcumin inhibited cancer cell proliferation, induced the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in various cancer types [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Curcumin has also been extensively investigated for their potential to stop metastasis from occurring [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, actual mechanisms of curcumin on the telomerase and stemness in cancer cells are poorly defined. Therefore, we tested a nitrogen-containing novel curcumin analog, compound 19, with the potential to simultaneously inhibit cancer stemness and telomerase in human colorectal cancer cells.</p><p>Several curcumin analogs were developed and studied. Recently, Madan and associates reported that curcumin analog HO-3867 converted mutant p53 to wild-type p53 and increased cytotoxicity on the cancer cells [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It has been shown that another curcumin analog L48H37 induced apoptosis through ROS-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress and STAT3 pathway in human lung cancer cells [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Liang and colleagues synthesized a new mono-carbonyl curcumin analog and induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Nonetheless, to date, there is no curcumin analog that showed both selective cancer stem cell inhibition and efficient telomerase activity reduction. We herein demonstrate the novel curcumin analog that inhibits cancer stem cell phenotype and telomerase in colorectal cancer cells.</p><p>Metastasis is driven by the variant cancer cells that acquired invasiveness, migration and colonization during the cancer development [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Mounting evidence suggests that these metastatic variant cells has cancer stem cell (CSC) like phenotype [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Cancer stem cells are unique cell populations that can differentiate and generate cancer cells in various types of cancer including colorectal cancer [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Collective work has revealed that cancer stem cells contribute to the therapeutic resistance and metastasis, leading to the recurrence in patients [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For these reasons, cancer stem cells are becoming a potential target for anti-cancer therapy. Although cancer stem cells are believed to be a promising target for novel therapies, the specific mechanisms by which these putative therapeutics could intervene is elusive.</p><p>One of the main characteristics of cancer stem cells is the self-renewal through the capability of modulating different molecular signaling pathways, including Wnt/&#x003b2;-Catenin, Sonic Hedgehog and Notch pathways [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Pharmacological targeting cancer stem cell specific signaling might be an excellent modality for colorectal cancer therapy. In cancer stem cells, transcription factors selectively activated include signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. STAT3 is a latent transcription factor that conveys various signals from cytokines and growth factors from cell membrane to nucleus [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Tyrosine 705 of STAT3 gets phosphorylated (pSTAT3) upon various cytokines and growth factors stimulation which leads to the subsequent transcriptional activation of its target genes [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. STAT3 is aberrantly activated in the aggressive cancers, hence a poor prognosis factor [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Another transcription factor frequently activated in cancer is NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. NF-&#x003ba;B regulates the cancer cell survival and drug resistance, simultaneously contributes to immune response to inflammation [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In this study, we used pSTAT3 and pNF-&#x003ba;B as inflammation biomarkers as well as targets for cancer stem cells to study the novel synthetic curcumin analog for its anti-cancer effects.</p><p>Telomerase elongates the telomere DNAs at the end of chromosomes [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It is composed of reverse transcriptase (TERT) and RNA component (TERC) and activated up to 90% of human malignancies including CRC, as targeting telomerase or hTERT structure has been suggested for cancer therapy [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Besides its canonical function for telomeric extension, hTERT has been implicated for cancer stem cell generation and maintenance through the cellular reprogramming processes [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Activated telomerase contributes to the metastasis via this conversion from cancer cells to cancer stem cells. This non-canonical function of telomerase attracted more attention to target telomerase for concurrently inhibiting cancer stem cell phenotype and telomerase in colorectal cancer therapeutic approaches.</p><p>We have previously shown that combined treatments with curcumin and green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) inhibited cancer stem cell phenotype in the aggressive breast cancer [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Herein, we hypothesized that a nitrogen-containing curcumin analog might inhibit cancer stem cell phenotype and telomerase through its anti-inflammatory impacts. We report a novel synthetic curcumin analog&#x02019;s inhibition on cancer stem cell phenotype and telomerase activity by inactivation of STAT3 and NF-&#x003ba;B in colorectal cancer stem cells. Further, we show that G1-phase cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis with a novel curcumin analog challenge. Our data suggest that a novel curcumin analog compound 19 can be an efficient therapeutic regimen for the advanced colorectal cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Compound 19 has a greater cytotoxicity than curcumin towards colorectal cancer cells while displayed a low toxicity on the normal epithelial colon cell line</title><p>A nitrogen-containing curcumin analog, compound 19, was synthesized with a central monoketone linker and two terminal pyridine rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We first tested the cytotoxicity of compound 19 on colorectal cancer cell lines. The HCT116 and DLD1 cancer cells were treated with compound 19 alongside its parental curcumin. Curcumin and compound 19 were serial diluted from 20 &#x003bc;M to 0.625 &#x003bc;M concentrations and monitored for cell viability with MTS assay as described in the methods. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, the IC<sub>50</sub> values of compound 19 and curcumin against HCT116 cells were 2.13 &#x003bc;M and 7 &#x003bc;M, respectively. In the DLD1 cell model, the IC<sub>50</sub> values of compound 19 and curcumin were 10 &#x003bc;M and 12 &#x003bc;M, respectively. Interestingly, compound 19 did not suppress 50% cell proliferation up to 20 &#x003bc;M in a CCD 841 normal colon epithelial cell line, suggesting a low toxicity of compound 19 on the normal colon cell line. The difference in drug response is possibly due to the different genetic make-up of two cell lines. In HCT116, there is a mutation in RAS while there is a p53 mutation in DLD1 [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Both HCT116 and DLD1 cell lines showed apoptotic morphology when treated with compound 19 for 48 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, compound 19 did not induce CCD841normal colon cell death.

CD51 (+) HCT116 cells expressed CD44, Oct-4, ALDHA1 and STAT3 was activated as shown by phosphorylation of Tyrosine 705. CD44 is a cancer stem cell biomarker and Oct-4 and ALDHA1 are stem cell biomarkers. When we treated CD51 (+) cells with compound 19, CD44 expression was downregulated and Oct-4, ALDH1 and pSTAT3 expressions were abolished. Similarly, in DLD1 CD133 (+) cells, CD44, Oct-4, ALDHA1 were expressed and STAT3 was activated. Compound 19 treatment downregulated CD44 and Oct-4 and abolished ALDHA1 expression.

It has many beneficial biological effects and exerts anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities (reviewed in [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]). However, the low bioavailability and a broad spectrum of targets have hampered its application in the clinical setting. Curcumin has been tested in clinical trials for its safety at high doses and activity against pancreatic cancer in human patients despite its low bioavailability [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The anti-tumor properties demonstrated by curcumin have led to our study its potential to target cancer stem cells and telomerase. Here, we have tested the synthetic curcumin analog compound 19 for its anti-cancer stem cell phenotype and anti-telomeric activities in colorectal cancer cells. Our experimental results indicate that compound 19 showed improved cytotoxicity on colorectal cancer cells, inhibited cancer stem cell phenotype, decreased telomerase activity and induced apoptosis efficiently. Both STAT3 and NF-&#x003ba;B were deactivated by compound 19 which resulted in reduced self-renewal gene expressions and telomerase activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><fig id="F10" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of compound 19 in colorectal cancer cells.</title><p>Compound 19 concurrently inhibits STAT3 and NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factors in colorectal cancer. Both STAT3 and NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptionally activate self-renewal genes and telomerase that resulted in enhanced stemness. Compound 19 also arrested cell cycle and induced apoptosis in the caspase-3 activated pathway. Our model suggests that a novel curcumin analog efficiently inhibits cancer stemness by deactivating STAT3 and NF-&#x003ba;B, and consequently decreasing telomerase activity and downregulating self-renewal gene expressions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="oncotarget-10-4516-g010"/></fig><p>Cancer stem cell concept present a new paradigm for cancer treatments. Cancer stem cells are cancer cells that have stem-like traits such as self-renewal and pluripotency [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It consists of small fraction of populations and often display chemo-resistance and radio-resistance during therapy, hence it is necessary to treat these cells to decrease metastasis and reduce recurrence. Compound 19 reduced the CD51 (+) subpopulation of HCT116 and CD133 (+) cells of DLD1 which are considered cancer stem cells. Compound 19 treatments also deactivated pSTAT3 and pNF-&#x003ba;B. Both STAT3 and NF-&#x003ba;B are transcription factors selectively activated in cancer stem cells [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Our data suggest that a novel curcumin analog might target STAT3 and NF-&#x003ba;B and consequently downregulate stem cell self-renewal gene expression transcriptionally. The strength of compound 19 lies in the ability to target STAT3 and NF-&#x003ba;B concurrently. It is still feasible that compound 19 interacts with the upstream signaling pathways of STAT3/NF-&#x003ba;B, thereby impacts the cancer stem cell phenotype. It remains to be seen if there is an interaction between compound 19 and potential upstream signaling pathways in colorectal cancer cells.</p><p>Telomerase is reverse transcriptase complex that elongates telomeres at the ends of chromosomes. It is overly activated in most cancers and now considered a universal biomarker for cancer [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In addition to its telomeric DNA polymerization, telomerase regulates a diverse cellular functions during oncogenesis [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Notably, telomerase reverse transcriptase plays a role in a transcriptional modulation of stemness genes in embryonic stem cells and cancer cells [<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This &#x0201c;non-canonical&#x0201d; function of telomerase has attracted our attention as a target for therapy during the development of novel regimens for colorectal cancer. Herein, we tested the novel curcumin analog&#x02019;s inhibitory effects on cancer stemness and telomerase side by side. STAT3 mediated transcriptional activation of hTERT led to self-renewal genes turn-on, hence increased the stemness in cancer cells. Compound 19 reduced cancer stem cell populations and deactivated STAT3 and NF-&#x003ba;B. Transcription factor STAT3 binding to hTERT promoter was decreased, consequently telomerase activity was reduced with compound 19 treatments. Our data suggest that compound 19 can be an efficient therapy for cancer stem cells by inhibiting STAT3 and repressing non-canonical function of telomerase for stemness in colorectal cancer. These results demonstrates the dual inhibition of compound 19 to stemness and telomerase which resulted in the cumulative effects on the metastatic cancer cells.</p><p>Apoptosis was clearly induced by compound 19, but unlike curcumin, it induced catalase and heme oxygenase in the HCT116 cell line. Curcumin and compound 19 showed the same apoptotic profiles in DLD1 cells. Structure wise, compound 19 has the similar two terminal aromatic rings, but is characteristic of the basic, nitro-containing pyridine rings. The molecular targets of curcumin as well as compound 19 have not been defined. The bioavailability of compound 19 is expected to be greatly improved compared with curcumin, due to the presence of metabolically stable mono-ketone linker and the nitrogen-containing aromatic rings, which will be measured in due course. Finally, more animal studies using curcumin and its analog are warranted and under way. Taken together, our data suggest that the nitrogen-containing curcumin analog compound 19 is a promising novel therapeutic regimen based on its anti-cancer stemness for the colorectal cancer.</p><p>The novel curcumin analog inhibits cancer stem cell phenotype in colon cancer cells. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase was transcriptionally suppressed by STAT3 inactivation upon the curcumin analog challenge. Furthermore, cell cycle was arrested and specific and distinct apoptotic pathways activated upon the curcumin analog treatments.
