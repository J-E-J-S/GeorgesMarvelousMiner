One possibility is that exposure to EE2 tips the balance during initial steps of sex differentiation, so that male genotypes show female-specific gene expression and gonad formation. Here we study EE2 effects on gene expression around the onset of sex differentiation in a population of European grayling (<italic>Thymallus thymallus</italic>) that suffers from sex ratio distortions. We exposed singly-raised embryos to one dose of 1&#x02009;ng/L EE2, studied gene expression 10&#x02009;days before hatching, at the day of hatching, and around the end of the yolk-sac stage, and related it to genetic sex (sdY genotype). We found that exposure to EE2 affects expression of a large number of genes, especially around hatching. These effects were strongly sex-dependent. We then raised fish for several months after hatching and found no evidence of sex reversal in the EE2-exposed fish. We conclude that ecologically relevant (i.e. low) levels of EE2 pollution do not cause sex reversal by simply tipping the balance at early stages of sex differentiation, but that they interfere with sex-specific gene expression.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12864-019-5955-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F&#x000f6;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_159579</award-id><award-id>31003A_182265</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wedekind</surname><given-names>Claus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003338</institution-id><institution>Bundesamt f&#x000fc;r Umwelt</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>none</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wedekind</surname><given-names>Claus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par9">Endocrine-disrupting chemicals are common pollutants that typically enter the environment after wastewater treatment. One of the most potent of these pollutants is the synthetic 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) that is used in oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapies, and that is more stable and persistent than the natural estrogen it mimics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. EE2 concentrations of 1&#x02009;ng/L and higher have been found in river or lake surface waters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], in lake sediments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and even in groundwater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Concentrations around 1&#x02009;ng/L therefore have ecological relevance.</p><p id="Par10">Exposure to 1 or a few ng/L EE2 can be damaging to fish at various developmental stages. Embryos and early larvae can suffer from increased mortality, reduced growth, or malformations when exposed to EE2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In juveniles and adults, exposure to EE2 can affect the response to infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], increase the susceptibility to other pollutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], generally reduce growth and fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and can even induce transgenerational effects on behavior and fertility in F1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and F2 progeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Studies with experimental populations kept in 1,100&#x02009;L ponds revealed population declines at concentrations of 1&#x02009;ng/L EE2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Long-term, whole-lake experiments revealed significant ecosystem changes after experimental addition of 5&#x02013;6&#x02009;ng/L EE2: local populations of small fish declined (one species, the fathead minnow <italic>Pimephalus promelas</italic>, nearly disappeared), average body conditions of other fish, including top predators, declined significantly, and the prevalence of some zooplankton and insect species increased, possibly as a consequence of the reduced abundance of fish that prey on them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As a result of these observations and associated risk analyses, the European Union recently proposed an annual average environmental quality standard of &#x0003c;&#x02009;35&#x02009;pg/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Experimental exposure to EE2 is associated with significant down- and up-regulation of various physiological pathways in fish. For example, juvenile sticklebacks (<italic>Gasterosteus aculeatus</italic>) exposed to 35&#x02013;40&#x02009;ng/L of EE2 showed reduced expression in testis for genes related to steroid biosynthesis (e.g., cytochrome P450 11A1 and 17A1, 3 beta- and steroid delta-isomerase 2) and increased expression in genes associated to epidermal growth (e.g., epidermal growth factor receptor) and xenobiotic metabolism (e.g., fms-related tyrosine kinase 4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Juvenile coho salmon (<italic>Oncorhynchus kisutch</italic>) exposed to 2 or 10&#x02009;ng/L of EE2 showed altered expression of genes linked to sexual-development and reproductive function: hepatic vitellogenin and pituitary luteinizing hormone were up-regulated, while pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone was down-regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Some of these effects on gene expression may be linked to the toxic effects of EE2 observed in juveniles and adults. However, it is likely that EE2 effects on gene expression depend on life history and on the developmental stage of an individual, i.e., on the timing of some physiological pathways in the organism. One important physiological pathway in this context is sex determination and gonad formation.</p><p id="Par12">Sex determination is probably best seen as a threshold trait, with few processes that occur early in development determining the cascade of processes of gonad development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In amphibians and fishes, these early processes can be very labile, i.e., potentially modifiable by external factors, even if they often have a clear genetic basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Among these external factors that interfere with these early steps of sex differentiation are temperature or endocrine disrupting chemicals such as aromatizable androgens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] or EE2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and other estrogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. EE2-induced sex reversals are sometimes but not always observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In salmonids, sex reversal can be induced by immersion of eyed eggs or larvae in high doses of EE2 (&#x02265; 400&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/L) (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]). However, little is known about the effects of ecologically relevant concentrations of EE2 (i.e., around 1&#x02009;ng/L or less) on gene expression at early stages of sex differentiation and on subsequent gonad formation.</p><p id="Par13">Aside divergences in gonadal development, there are other fundamental differences between male and female development in fishes. These include, for example, average growth and timing of maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], habitat use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] or susceptibility to various stressors including infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In this regard, it remains unclear whether long-term differences should also be expected between the genetic sexes upon the effect of EE2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Such questions can be studied if reliable sex-linked genetic markers are available for a given study species.</p><p id="Par14">Here we study the sex-specific gene expression and gonad development in grayling (<italic>Thymallus thymallus</italic>), a river-dwelling salmonid that is likely to be exposed to EE2 pollution when its habitat receives treated wastewater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Yano et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] established sex-linked genetic markers that can be used to determine the genetic sex of many salmonids. These markers could be successfully verified in over 100 phenotypically sexed adult grayling sampled from our study population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Genetic sexing of juvenile grayling revealed that sex differentiation takes place during the first 6 months after hatching and goes through a male stage in both sexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This makes the grayling a rare example of a so-called &#x0201c;undifferentiated&#x0201d; gonochoristic species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Genetic female grayling first develop testis tissues, followed by a testis-to-ovary stage (with perinuclear follicles loosely scattered within testicular tissue), before ovaries are developed, consisting of perinuclear follicles and oogonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Moreover, sex differentiation is delayed in male grayling who instead grow faster than females during the first months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">We use genetic sexing to study sex-specific effects of a low and hence ecologically relevant concentration of EE2 on gene expression at the onset of sex differentiation. Maitre et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] found large differences between genetic sexes of grayling at the gene expression level (in heads) around the time of hatching from eggs, while gene expression (whole embryos) did not seem to differ significantly between the sexes at late embryogenesis. Their findings suggest that the physiological cascade of sex differentiation starts during embryogenesis and before hatching, which is consistent with patterns observed in other salmonids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. We therefore study the interaction between EE2 and genetic sex on gene expression in embryos, hatchlings, and juveniles. Within-family comparisons are used to minimize potential effects of genetic variation. Possible effects of EE2 on gonad development are then studied histologically on samples taken over a period of several months of juvenile development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experimental breeding, rearing, and treatment</title><p id="Par16">Ten males and 8 females were sampled from a captive breeding stock and stripped for their gametes. These fish are F1 of the wild population that spawns in the River Aare in the city of Thun, Switzerland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Their gametes were used in two full-factorial breeding blocks. For each breeding block, four females were crossed in vitro with five males, i.e., 40 (2x4x5) different sibgroups were produced (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). After egg hardening for 2&#x000a0;h, the fertilized eggs were transported to the laboratory where they were washed and distributed to 24-well plates with low-evaporation lids (Falcon, Becton-Dickinson), following the methods of von Siebenthal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In total, 10,789 eggs (range 184&#x02013;352 per sibgroup) were distributed (one egg per well). The wells had been filled with 1.8&#x02009;mL chemically standardized water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] that had been oxygenated and temperated before use. Eggs were considered fertilized if embryos were visible 14 dpf (days post fertilization). Overall fertilization rate turned out to be 69.8%. The embryos were then used for several parallel studies: to compare the effects of EE2 and other environmental stressors on embryo development in different salmonid species (Marques da Cunha et al., in preparation), and to study sex differentiation in grayling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">The embryos used for the present study (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1) were incubated in a climate chamber set at high humidity to further minimize evaporation, and at 7&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for the first 27 dpf. At 27 dpf, the temperature of the climate chamber was raised to 10&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and to 11.5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C 1 day later to induce and synchronize hatching and hence to increase comparability across all the samples of gene expression at hatching time. The temperatures we used correspond well to the mean temperatures that the embryos would experience at the natural spawning place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].

We left the freshly distributed embryos undisturbed until 14 dpf in order to minimize mortality due to handling during the very first stages of embryogenesis. We then largely followed protocols of previous studies, i.e., embryos were exposed either to one dose of 1&#x02009;ng/L EE2 (by adding 0.2&#x02009;mL water with a concentration of 10&#x02009;ng/L EE2, see Brazzola et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and Marques da Cunha et al.

We used this concentration of EE2 because it appears ecologically relevant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Additional treatments with <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens or P. fluorescens</italic> plus one dose of 1&#x02009;ng/L EE2 were done on further embryos in the course of a parallel study (Marques da Cunha et al. in preparation). We did not sample <italic>P. fluorescens-</italic>treated individuals for the gene expression analyses, but about half of the juveniles that were sampled for the histological analyses were <italic>P. fluorescens-</italic>treated.

We therefore assume that the 2&#x02009;pg EE2 that we added per 2&#x02009;mL well were largely taken up by the embryos during the observational period.</p><p id="Par20">Hatched larvae were raised in the well plates until 40 dpf, i.e., until several days after hatching and around the end of the yolk-sac stage, when about 660 individuals per treatment group were about equally distributed to two 200&#x02009;L tanks each (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1).

The tanks were filled with lake water that had been pumped from Lake Geneva at 40&#x02009;m depth. The physico-chemical parameters of freshly pumped water as determined in early July with a pHmeter744 (Metrohm, Switzerland) and a FireStingO2 (PyroScience, Denmark) were: temperature&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, pH&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.7, oxidation-reduction potential (mV)&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;42, O<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10.46&#x02009;mg/L). The tanks were filled several days before the fish were introduced, i.e., water temperature could adapt to the temperature in the climate room. The juveniles were first fed with live <italic>Artemia</italic> and copepods and later with dry food. For the EE2-treated groups (i.e. juveniles that had been exposed to EE2 during the embryo stage and were now exposed again during the juvenile stages), 200&#x02009;ng EE2 were dissolved in 200&#x02009;L tanks each to reach a starting concentration of 1&#x02009;ng/L. Every 7&#x02009;days from then on, 40&#x02009;L per tank (i.e., 20%) were replaced with fresh lake water. In the EE2-treated groups, these 40&#x02009;L were spiked with 40&#x02009;mL of a 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/L EE2 stock solution (i.e., 40&#x02009;L at 1&#x02009;ng/L EE2). Water samples (100&#x02009;mL each) were then taken from each of the 4 EE2-treated tanks 1&#x02009;h after this weekly water exchange (T<sub>0</sub>) and 7&#x02009;days later, just before the next water exchange (T<sub>7</sub>). These water samples were immediately frozen and stored at &#x02212;&#x02009;20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C protected from light.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] found to be differentially expressed in genetic males and females at the embryo stage 10&#x02009;days before hatching suggest that sex differentiation starts around then, i.e., at a time when the embryos had already been exposed to EE2 for several days in the present study. Of note, Maitre et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] used a de novo transcriptome whereas here we mapped transcripts to a published genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], which is more reliable and more powerful (61% of reads mapped to the genome, vs. 52% to the de novo transcriptome). Thus, while numbers are slightly different between our Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Maitre et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], the trends are consistent. There is weak evidence that a transcript of cytochrome P450 1d1 is already six-fold more expressed in females than males in embryos; most other known sex marker genes are only significantly differentially expressed at hatching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">One possible scenario is hence that EE2 could tip the balance at the early steps of sex differentiation so that all individuals follow the developmental process that leads to the female phenotype regardless of their sdY genotype; i.e., sex reversal of genetic males. If so, EE2 may not be expected to show strong sex-genotype specific effects on gene expression during later stages of sex differentiation. However, we found strong interactions between genetic sex and EE2 on gene expression. These sex-specific reactions to EE2 also depended on the developmental stages we studied. At the embryo stage, expression of only few genes seemed biased in genetic females, but gene expression in genetic males was already significantly affected, with about 400 genes up- or down-regulated under the influence of EE2. The outcome was somewhat reversed in juvenile heads: now only few genes of genetic males seemed to be affected by EE2, while over 9,000 genes were differentially expressed in genetic females. An even more pronounced effect of EE2 could be seen in heads at the day of hatching: over 20,000 genes showed differential expression, and about half of them were either up-regulated in genetic females and down-regulated in genetic males or down-regulated in genetic females and upregulated in genetic males.</p><p id="Par43">The strong sex-specific responses to EE2 suggest that exposure to ecologically relevant concentrations of EE2 during embryogenesis did not simply tip the balance at early steps of sex differentiation, so that all individuals would become phenotypic females and would show similar patterns of gene expression from then on. Instead, our observations suggest that genetic sex largely determined phenotypic sex, and that EE2 then interfered with sex-specific gene expression, creating the strong sex-specific reactions to EE2 in the head. This conclusion is supported by the observation that at the low concentrations of EE2 commonly observed in natural rivers and streams, similar to those we used, there is little evidence for complete and population-wide sex reversal, even if natural populations sometimes show distorted sex ratios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. However, it is still possible that higher doses of EE2 can tip the balance at early steps of sex differentiation and thereby affect phenotypic sex. It would then be interesting to compare gene expression relative to genetic sex versus phenotypic sex, and to study more tissues.</p><p id="Par44">The interaction between EE2 and genetic sex on gene expression suggests that exposure to EE2 is mostly interfering with the development of a phenotype that would correspond to the genotypic sex. It is possible that we missed sex reversal (genetic males developing ovaries), because we learned only during the course of the study that the grayling is a rare example (and probably even the only one so far) of an undifferentiated gonochorist that goes through an all-male stage before gonads differentiate into testes and ovaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Testis tissue in early juveniles can therefore neither be interpreted as evidence for normal development of a male phenotype nor as evidence for sex reversal in genetic females. However, by the end of the study, nearly all genetic females had developed ovarian tissue. This suggests that the rate of sex reversals is either low indeed, or that sex reversal would slow down gonad development so much that we would have missed many sex-reversed individuals within our observational window. We know of no examples or arguments in the literature that would support the latter possibility. Moreover, EE2-induced sex reversal would lead to mismatches between genotypes and phenotypes that can, on the long term, affect population demography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Wedekind et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and Maitre et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] specifically searched for such mismatches in a wild population of grayling and found none. The authors concluded that the distorted population sex ratios that have been observed in their study population are not due to environmental sex reversal (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]) but more likely linked to sex-specific mortality. It remains to be tested whether sex-genotype specific reactions to endocrine-disrupting pollutants can contribute to sex-specific mortality in the wild.</p><p id="Par45">Our gene expression analysis suggested that exposure to EE2 induces effects in the transcriptomes of the brain that could be interpreted as partial sex reversal: At the day of hatching, we did not find any significant difference between the gene expression patterns in the heads of EE2-treated males and control females. This apparently feminizing effect of EE2 seemed to cease before the (next sampled) juvenile stage. In contrast, gene expression in the heads of EE2-treated genetic females was alike the one of control males at both hatching and juvenile stage, as if exposure to EE2 induced partial masculinization. Estrogens are known to affect functions of the nervous system, including synapsis homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] and sexual differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. In mammals, for instance, aromatizable androgens (e.g. testosterone) are converted into estrogen by brain aromatases to promote masculinization of brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. In fish, however, the role of estrogen in the development of sexual behaviors is still poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], and is more labile than in mammals. Effects of EE2 on male behavior have been observed in goldfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], while, to our knowledge, no study reported effect on females. In general, in fish aromatases are feminizing enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. But in fish brain, estrogen strongly up-regulates aromatases and differentiating male rainbow trout (<italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>) were observed with an increased expression of aromatases as compared to females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Thus, evidence so far is unclear on a masculinizing or feminizing role of brain in salmonids. Of note, we did not analyze carefully excised brain tissues here but whole heads, thus the importance of gene expression in other types of tissues remains unclear. Further studies that specifically concentrate on brain tissues are necessary to confirm our first observation.</p><p id="Par46">In salmonids, gonadal precursor cells typically differentiate during the weeks that follow hatching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. During this period, the emergence of an endogenous synthesis of sexual hormones could explain why we observed a divergent response between sexes, especially if we consider that endocrine active compounds often elicit non-monotonic dose-responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Such dose-effects could explain why we observed strong sex-specific responses to EE2 at hatching day and why these responses partly declined towards the juvenile stage we sampled next. Apart from the likely effects of EE2 on normal development of male and female phenotypes, exposure to EE2 also affected the expression of genes linked to many other physiological systems, including, for example, various aspects of the development of the nervous system, of skeletal muscles and of insulin metabolism. Such effects could have been responsible for the observed delay of sex differentiation. The delay does not seem to be simply stress-related, because exposure to <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> during embryogenesis that is known to slow down embryo development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] did not cause analogous delays in sex differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par47">Exposure to high concentrations of EE2 during juvenile or early juvenile stages has been shown to induce sex reversal in many fishes. Low and ecologically relevant concentrations of EE2, i.e. concentrations that have been observed in polluted rivers, would still affect sex determination if they tipped the balance at early steps of sex differentiation so that all individuals follow the developmental process that leads to the female phenotype regardless of their sdY genotype (i.e., sex reversal of genetic males). If this were so, and if gene expression were then more influenced by gonadal development than by genetic sex, EE2 would probably not be expected to show strong sex-genotype specific effects on gene expression during later stages of sex differentiation. However, we found that exposure to EE2 during early embryogenesis leads to strong sex-genotype specific effects on gene expression after the onset of sex differentiation. Such sex-genotype specific effects suggest that low concentrations of EE2 do not tip the balance at early steps of sex differentiation. It still needs to be tested if the sex-genotype specific effects of EE2 on gene expression cause sex-specific toxic effects of EE2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec15"><p>
