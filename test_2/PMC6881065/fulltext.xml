During viral assembly, the failure to package all eight segments, or packaging a mutated segment, renders the resulting virion incompletely infectious. It is known that the accumulation of these defective particles can limit viral disease by interfering with the spread of fully infectious particles. In order to harness this phenomenon therapeutically, we defined which viral packaging signals were amenable to duplication and developed a viral genetic platform which produced replication competent IAVs that require up to two additional artificial genome segments for full infectivity. The modified and artificial genome segments propagated by this approach are capable of acting as &#x0201c;decoy&#x0201d; segments that, when packaged by coinfecting wild-type viruses, lead to the production of non-infectious viral particles. Although IAVs which require 10 genomic segments for full infectivity are able to replicate themselves and spread <italic>in vivo</italic>, their genomic modifications render them avirulent in mice. Administration of these viruses, both prophylactically and therapeutically, was able to rescue animals from a lethal influenza virus challenge. Together, our results show that replicating IAVs designed to propagate and spread defective genomic segments represent a potent anti-influenza biological therapy that can target the conserved process of particle assembly to limit viral disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Influenza infections are best prevented via prophylactic vaccination. Vaccination, however, is incompletely efficacious, necessitating the use of anti-influenza therapeutics. To date, several different classes of anti-influenza therapeutics have been developed and used in order to combat these infections. Unfortunately, the incidence of influenza resistance to many of these therapeutics has begun to rise, necessitating the development of new strategies. One such strategy is to mimic the activity of naturally occurring viral particles that harbor defective genomes. These defective interfering particles have the ability to interfere with productive viral assembly, preventing the spread of influenza viruses across the respiratory tract. Furthermore, given the manner in which they target influenza segment packaging, a conserved feature of all influenza A viruses, resistance to this therapeutic strategy is unlikely. Here, we report the development of a genetic platform that allows the production of replicating influenza viruses which require 10 genomic segments to be fully infectious. These viruses are capable of amplifying themselves in isolation, but coinfection with a wild-type virus leads to segment exchange and compromises the spread of both viruses. This interference, while mechanistically distinct from naturally occurring defective particles, was able to target the same viral process and rescue animals exposed to an otherwise lethal viral infection. This viral-based approach may represent a cost effective and scalable method to generate effective anti-influenza therapeutics when vaccines or antiviral drugs become ineffective due to the acquisition of viral resistance mutations.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CEIRS Contract No. HHSN272201400005C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5307-3428</contrib-id><name><surname>Heaton</surname><given-names>Nicholas S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-CA009111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1446-2359</contrib-id><name><surname>Harding</surname><given-names>Alfred T.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-CA009111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8095-5012</contrib-id><name><surname>Chambers</surname><given-names>Benjamin S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>N.S.H. is partially supported by federal funds from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, under CEIRS Contract No. HHSN272201400005C.

Each year, it is estimated that influenza viruses cause up to 5 million severe infections globally, resulting in up to 645,000 mortalities [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In 2018, patient care and productivity loss due to influenza infection cost an estimated $11.2 billion in the U.S. alone [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Influenza A virus (IAV), is the major contributor to total influenza disease, and the primary measure used to control IAV spread is prophylactic immunization. However, due to rapid viral antigenic drift, vaccination can have limited efficacy and therefore therapeutic small molecules are also used for treating influenza disease. Amantadines, which inhibit the influenza M2 ion channel were the first IAV therapeutics developed, and were approved for clinical use in 1966 [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Point mutations in the channel itself, however, can lead to resistance to these inhibitors, and high levels of resistance are now widespread in H1, H3, H5, H7, H9, and H17 subtype influenza A viruses [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir, are now the most commonly used IAV therapeutic [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, this class of inhibitors suffers from viral resistance as well [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Recently, an mRNA cap-snatching inhibitor, Baloxavir, was FDA-approved [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and the rate at which viral resistance may be acquired is currently unknown. Due to the limited timeframes after infection in which these therapeutics are effective, as well as the threat of emerging viral resistance, additional antiviral therapeutics are currently in various stages of development [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. One promising alternative therapeutic approach, that theoretically would be difficult for IAVs to develop resistance to, has been the utilization of defective viral particles that disrupt viral replication and packaging [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Defective viral particles are produced by, and important for, a number of different RNA viruses [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For influenza viruses, these particles represent replication-incompetent virions that frequently harbor one or more viral genomic segments with a significant deletion of the open reading frame (ORF) of that segment [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Internal deletions can occur spontaneously during the replication stage of the viral lifecycle and lead to the formation of a genomic segment that fails to include most of the ORF but retains the 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; packaging signals necessary for gene segment incorporation [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. If this partially deleted segment is packaged into nascent virions, these particles are capable of infecting a host cell, but are then unable to produce viable progeny due to the absence of the protein normally encoded by the defective genomic segment [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. While these defective interfering particles (DIPs) are replication incompetent, they can be successfully propagated during coinfection with another defective or a fully infectious viral particle. Although it was believed that such coinfections are relatively uncommon, recent work has shown that coinfection may actually be an important contributor to productive virus replication [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Furthermore, when DIP coinfection occurs, the defective segment(s) of the interfering particle are thought to be replicated more quickly than their wild-type counterparts due to their significantly smaller size [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The disruptive effect of DIPs has garnered attention as a potential influenza antiviral treatment [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Studies have shown that laboratory-produced DIPs can be used prophylactically and therapeutically to protect mice and ferrets from IAV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This DI system has also been shown to be effective <italic>in vitro</italic> in human respiratory tract cell lines [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Despite these advances, options for generating DIPs have been limited. Initially, DIPs were synthesized via high multiplicity passaging, which not only generates diverse DI populations with varying efficacy, but also contains wild-type IAVs that must be inactivated by UV irradiation [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Reverse genetic cloning has offered a means through which to generate populations of specific DIP genotypes, however this method requires the use of helper viruses for the proliferation of the DIPs, which still necessitates subsequent UV inactivation.</p><p>We were interested in generating IAV mutants that therapeutically mimic the inhibitory activity of DIPs, but using a fundamentally different molecular strategy. We hypothesized that a live-attenuated virus population harboring and amplifying synthetic artificial genome segments could interfere with wild-type viral spread via the cross-packaging of the artificial genomic segments during a coinfection. In this report, we describe the genomic design of an IAV strain that requires the presence of 10 genomic segments (10S virus) to be fully infectious that accomplishes this goal. Administration of 10S viruses either prophylactically or therapeutically rescued animals from an otherwise lethal viral infection. Thus, reprogramming an IAV viral genome to interfere with normal viral spread is a viable approach and one that may be less susceptible to the development of viral resistance, as the target is the generally conserved process of viral genome assembly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Evaluation of viral genetic manipulations capable of generating IAVs that require 9 genomic segments</title><p>We were interested in generating influenza viruses that could be genetically programmed to harbor artificial genomic segments that would interfere with the genome assembly of WT-IAV strains. It was previously reported that the NA packaging signals could be duplicated and utilized to propagate a ninth genomic segment [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. While this approach was initially used to encode additional antigens as a vaccine platform, we theorized that this and similar approaches could be utilized to generate viruses harboring artificial, interfering segments. We therefore tested the ability to duplicate various packaging signals and generate viruses that required 9 segments (9S viruses) to be fully infectious in the A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) genetic background. We tested the incorporation of additional segments via the duplication of NA, NP, HA, and PA packaging signals in different combinations (<xref rid="ppat.1008098.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008098.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). In all cases, the &#x0201c;9<sup>th</sup>&#x0201d; segment was designed encoding super-folder GFP (sfGFP) or mCherry and harboring unique packaging signals so that it would always be packaged and failure to package the duplicated packaging signal segment would lead to the loss of an essential viral protein. Surprisingly, very few segment duplications were amenable to this approach. As previously reported, duplication of the NA packaging signal is tolerated, but of all of the other segments tested, only duplication of the PA packaging signal was tolerated (<xref

Duplicating HA packaging signals and encoding M1 as an artificial segment was unsuccessful. However, duplicating the NA packaging signals and encoding NS1 successfully yielded 9S virions. The &#x0201c;NS&#x0201d; segment encoding mCherry and NEP however, immediately lost mCherry signal upon viral rescue, indicating that this approach is not useful for the stable incorporation of protein or nucleic acid. From these experiments we conclude that the duplication of packaging signals is not a generalizable approach for all segments, but in some specific cases, such as with NA and PA packaging signals, this approach can be utilized to force viral propagation of a 9<sup>th</sup> genomic segment.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Characterization of 9S viruses and their therapeutic efficacy</title><p>We next began <italic>in vitro</italic> characterization of the 9S PB1 mCherry virus, with duplicated NA packaging signals, and the 9S PB2 sfGFP virus, with duplicated PA packaging signals. We hypothesized that our genomic design could potentially lead to three major populations of virions: One that packaged all 9 segments, or two different eight-segmented viruses which failed to package one of the segments with duplicated packaging signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008098.g001">Fig 1A &#x00026; 1B</xref>). After infection of MDCK cells with these viruses, we observed the expected fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008098.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), and co-positivity for the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein was observed at approximately the same rate as an eight-segmented fluorescent reporter virus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008098.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). These results indicate that, as designed, the artificial genomic segments (which have unique packaging signals) are present when viral replication occurs. These data however, did not report on the relative packaging of all of the manipulated viral segments. We therefore designed segment specific qRT-PCR assays and observed that our 9S viral particles package variable levels of different genomic segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008098.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). Consistent with our design and microscopy data, the fluorescent genomic segments (PB1 mCherry &#x00026; PB2 sfGFP) were packaged very efficiently, but the modified segments encoding viral proteins with duplicated packaging signals exhibited drastically reduced packaging relative to their matched packaging signal counterparts (e.g. the segment with NA PS harboring PB1 vs the WT NA segment).</p><fig id="ppat.1008098.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1008098.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Viruses that require 9 genomic segments for infectivity generate more defective particles than the parental strain.</title><p>(A and B) Potential genomic configurations of the 9S PB1 mCherry virus (A) and the 9S PB2 sfGFP virus (B) assuming packaging of at least 8 segments.

Since this reduction was likely due to progeny virions failing to package one of the required segments, we grew the viruses under multiple conditions and measured both infectious particles via plaque assay and also performed a hemagglutinin (HA) assay, which measures both infectious and noninfectious particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008098.g001">Fig 1G and 1H</xref>). Regardless of growth conditions, we again observed a major reduction in viral titer, while the magnitude of the observed defect in the HA assay was much smaller. To represent this difference, we calculated the &#x0201c;relative DI units&#x0201d; of our 9S viruses, relative to WT PR8 virus set at an arbitrary value of 1, by dividing HA units by the endpoint titer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008098.g001">Fig 1I</xref>). From this analysis, we conclude that the 9S PB1 mCherry virus produced ~100x times more defective viral progeny and the 9S PB2 sfGFP virus produced ~1000 times more non-viable progeny than did WT PR8 regardless of where the viruses were propagated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008098.g001">Fig 1I</xref>). Finally, in order to test if these genomic modifications were only applicable to the PR8 viral background, we cloned a 9S PB2 sfGFP virus in the unrelated H3N2 A/Wyoming/03/03 background. We were able to successfully rescue this virus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008098.s004">S3 Fig</xref>), demonstrating that these genomic manipulations are not exclusively tolerated in laboratory-adapted H1N1 IAV strains.</p><p>We next wanted to assess how requiring a 9<sup>th</sup> genomic segment for full infectivity would affect virulence in C57BL/6 mice, as well as determine if 9S fluorescent viruses could interfere with influenza disease. We therefore administered increasing doses of the virus and while the parental PR8 virus induced lethal disease at all doses tested, the two 9S viruses were significantly attenuated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008098.g002">Fig 2A&#x02013;2F</xref>). The 9S PB1 mCherry virus required 10<sup>4</sup> PFU for lethal disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008098.g002">Fig 2B and 2E</xref>) while the 9S PB2 sfGFP was slightly more virulent, and some mortality was observed at the 10<sup>3</sup> PFU dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008098.g002">Fig 2C and 2F</xref>). Based on this attenuation, and the presumed large amount of DI particles being produced <italic>in vivo</italic>, we next assessed the capability of each 9-segmented fluorescent virus to interfere with a lethal PR8 infection. We coinfected animals with 20 PFU of WT virus in combination with 500 PFU of either the 9S PB1 mCherry or the 9S PB2 sfGFP virus and monitored morbidity and mortality for 14 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008098.g002">Fig 2G</xref>).

Because our two 9S viruses were generated with non-overlapping packaging signal duplications, we tested combining these two approaches to generate a virus that required 10 genomic segments (10S) to be fully infectious. Based on our data from 9S viruses, we expected that actual 10-segmented particles would be rare and most of the particles generated would only package 8 segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008098.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), however 9-segmented permutations were also a possibility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008098.s005">S4A Fig</xref>). Combining the two 9S strategies was successful, and we were able to rescue an IAV strain that propagated six unmodified genomic segments alongside four genetically manipulated ones. A fluorescent microscopy time-course of the 10S virus revealed that, as designed, where virus replication occurred, both of the fluorescent artificial segments were present as evidenced by the high percentage of cells expressing dual color fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008098.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008098.s005">S4B Fig</xref>).

Multicycle growth curve analysis of the 10S virus showed that it grew poorly, likely due to compounded effects of artificial segment packaging rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008098.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). In order to define which segments were not efficiently packaged, we performed qRT-PCR and saw that not only were the segments with duplicated packaging signals (PB2 PA PS, and PB1 NA PS) packaged at markedly reduced rates, their WT segment counterparts of WT PA and NA were also packaged less efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008098.g004">Fig 4D</xref>).

Our approach was mechanistically distinct from naturally occurring DI particles; the 9S and 10S platforms however, essentially mimic the concept of facilitating packaging of a defective viral segment, which then leads to the release of virions bearing incomplete viral genomes. Despite 9 and 10S viruses displaying incomplete genome packaging, delayed replication kinetics, and lower peak titers, we showed that administration of these viruses can have significant disruptive effects for the normal pathogenesis of WT IAV.</p><p>A number of new questions were raised by our development of these viruses. We tested a variety of viral genomic organizations and found that only rare combinations of viral genes and packaging signals were able to be tolerated by the virus. The rationale for why this is the case is unclear, but there are probably a number of constraints that underlie this phenomenon. First there is known to be a hierarchy of viral segment packaging [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and thus, some segments (identified by the virus based on the packaging signals) may be less tolerant of duplication than others and lead to a disruption of the structure/assembly of the IAV genome. In line with this concept, work using seven-segmented influenza viruses has demonstrated that the requirement for different packaging signals is variable with respect to viral assembly [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Interestingly, this earlier work demonstrated that both the NA and PA packaging signals are not required for the packaging of the other genomic segments. Our ability to duplicate both of those packaging signals agrees with the concept that these particular packaging signals play a relatively less important role in viral assembly.</p><p>The seven-segmented virus work however, does not necessarily predict the ability of a given packaging signal to be duplicated. For example, NS packaging signals were also shown to be dispensable, yet we were unable to rescue a virus with duplicated NS packaging signals (<xref rid="ppat.1008098.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This discrepancy may be explained by the fact that the levels of transcription and translation of these viral segments is controlled by motifs in these specific segments [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and thus the combination of different viral ORFs and packaging signals leads to a disruption of the normal controllers of viral transcription/translation rates, negatively impacting viral fitness. This concept is somewhat supported by our data that a virus encoding the PB2 protein flanked by NP packaging signals is non-viable; NP is expressed in cells to a much higher level than PB2. When we encoded PB2 flanked by PA packaging signals however, the virus was viable, and PA and PB2 levels in the infected cell are reasonably similar [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Another question raised by our work is the mechanism of segment discrimination by the virus during packaging. Our qRT-PCR data on purified 9S and 10S viruses indicate that segments harboring essentially the exact same packaging signals can be discriminated from each other. In all cases, packaging of the WT segment was strongly favored (usually by more than 100x) over a modified segment which had the same packaging signal flanking a different viral ORF. It is unclear how the virus is performing this selective packaging, but we can envision a number of potential explanations. First, the packaging signals in the modified segment are not actually identical to the WT packaging signals. Because translation cannot be allowed to begin in the packaging signals (as they normally would when they overlap the ORF in a normal segment), any ATG sequences (usually two-three in a given packaging signal) are mutated to TTG. We don&#x02019;t believe however, that these changes can fully explain segment discrimination, as those slightly mutated packaging signals are perfectly competent to facilitate segment packaging [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Other potential contributors to segment discrimination are: artificially increased UTR length, altered total segment length, or the lack (or even absence) of a required, but undefined, sequence in the ORF portion of the segment. It may be the case that 9S or 10S viruses represent an experimental system with which to answer this question and more fully define sequences that control viral genomic assembly.</p><p>Our data show that most virions package 8 segments even when segments with duplicated packaging signals are required for complete infectivity. It is important to note that our data do not allow us to define how often a fully infectious event is derived from true packaging of a 9<sup>th</sup> or 10<sup>th</sup> genomic segment in a viral particle or from co-infection of particles with incomplete genomes. We believe that both of these possibilities likely occur, with virions harboring extra segments potentially playing a more important role early in infection when the number of viral particles per cell is low. If true that some viral particles can functionally package extra genomic segments, it is unclear how they would be organized within the capsid. It is well accepted that IAVs package their segments in a &#x0201c;pinwheel&#x0201d; or 7+1 conformation, wherein a single segment, most likely one of the polymerase segments based on its size, is packaged in the center with the remaining seven segments arranged around it in a circular shape [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Understanding how the addition of one or two segments could alter this structure could lead to a better understanding of IAV packaging in general. Along these same lines, it is currently unclear how much nucleic acid an influenza virus particle can hold. Other published IAV engineering strategies have significantly increased the length of genomic segments [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and potentially increasing the number of genomic segments raises important questions about not only the maximum amount of genetic material tolerated, but also what defines that limit. Answering these questions becomes especially relevant when considering the potential for utilizing influenza viruses as viral vectors [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>Finally, the fact that 9S and 10S viruses can interfere with WT viral propagation strongly supports the notion that cellular coinfection is a common occurrence <italic>in vivo</italic>. Despite the fact that IAV particles package all eight genomic segments the majority of the time [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], a relatively small percentage of viral particles are fully infectious [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Recent work has suggested that coinfection between incompletely infectious particles may be a frequent occurrence that not only allows viral reassortment [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], but also plays a critical role in normal viral spread across infected tissues [<xref rid="ppat.1008098.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Since 9S and 10S interference with WT viral packaging are dependent on coinfection with WT viruses, we not only favor this model, but propose that even distinct viral infections that begin at different times are also subject to this coinfection phenomenon. It is worth noting however, that the protective effects of 9S and 10S viruses are not necessarily mediated exclusively by interfering with genomic segment packaging, as indirect effects of defective particles such as innate immune activation could also contribute to protection from IAV challenge.</p><p>In summary, we have successfully defined genomic architectures that allow influenza viruses to propagate up to two additional, artificial segments. Our work suggests that not all IAV packaging signals are amenable to manipulations such as duplication, and that the particular characteristics of an artificial viral segment are not as important to its interfering effect as the absolute number of segments that can disrupt productive genomic packaging. Continued development of the 10-segmented replication-competent IAV platform may lead to a novel class of therapeutics that can be easily manufactured, safely administered, and display protective efficacy against viruses that have evolved resistance to other antiviral therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal procedures were carried out in compliance with the Duke University IACUC approved protocol number A189-18-08.

Following the incubation period, the infection medium was removed and cells were placed in complete medium supplemented with 1:1000 diluted TPCK trypsin. At the indicated time after infection, MDCK cell medium was removed and replaced with 1 ml of warm PBS. Cells were incubated with Hoechst stain (1 microliter/ml of PBS) to allow for the staining of nuclei, and imaging was performed on the Zoe fluorescent cell imager (Bio-Rad) using the same gain, exposure and zoom settings for all images taken.

Four days post-infection, mice were collected and given a lethal dose of ketamine-xylazine (400 uL). Once sufficiently anesthetized, a cervical dislocation was performed before removing the whole lung and trachea from the mice. Lung samples were then homogenized in 1 mL of PBS using the Benchmark BeadBlaster 24 Microtube Homogenizer. Homogenized samples were then spun to pellet the insoluble pieces of lung and the supernatant was collected, aliquoted and frozen at -80C.
