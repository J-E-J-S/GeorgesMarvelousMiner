The oleaginous, carotenogenic yeast <italic>Rhodosporidium toruloides</italic> (also known as <italic>Rhodotorula toruloides</italic>) is a promising host for sustainable bioproduction due to its innate capacity to efficiently utilize both hexoses and pentoses present in lignocellulosic biomass, as well as its capacity to grow on lignin derived intermediates and aromatics, such as <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid and ferulic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. So far, much of the work on metabolic engineering or bioproduct formation in <italic>R. toruloides</italic> has focused on lipid accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the high lipid content indicates a suitability for applications to any acetyl-CoA-derived product, from fatty alcohols, terpenes and methyl ketones to TCA-cycle derived products, with many applications such as fuels, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">To improve prospects for more advanced metabolic engineering in this fungal host, the development of robust genetic tools and resources is an immediate priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A major need on the tools front is for efficient and stable promoters to express genes of interest and selection markers. A growing branch of synthetic biology involves the pursuit and improvement of standard parts that are reliable, orthogonal and robust for non-conventional hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A small selection of promoters has already been characterized to modulate expression of heterologous genes in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>toruloides</italic>, the majority of them being metabolite-responsive promoters rather than constitutive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. While promoters that are responsive to certain metabolites are valuable tools, a toolset of well characterized constitutive promoters remains necessary to explore the full potential of strain engineering. In this context, functional bidirectional promoters would be a valuable addition to the toolset, since they can be convenient for optimization of multi-gene pathways.</p><p id="Par6">The most common method used for transformation of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>toruloides</italic> is <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>-mediated transformation (ATMT), a useful strategy for genomic integration of heterologous genes but is a laborious and time-consuming process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

Interestingly, this occurs for two of the strongest promoters, P15 (<italic>ANT</italic>) and P9 (histone H3) when strains are cultured in YPD medium, but not in the SD media. This is likely due to the cells reaching stationary phase significantly faster in YPD compared to SD media (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2 and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3).
