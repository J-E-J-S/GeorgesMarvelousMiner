The Warburg effect describes the ability of cancer cells to consume larger amounts of glucose compared to normal tissues. We identified derivatives of natural 1,4-naphthoquinones to be active in CRPC and further synthetically modified them via glucose conjugation to increase selectivity by Warburg effect targeting. Mechanisms of action were examined by quantitative proteomics followed by bioinformatical analysis and target validation. Four synthesized molecules revealed the highest selectivity towards human CRPC cells, which correlated with higher GLUT-1 activity and expression. The compounds were able to induce pro-apoptotic signs and to inhibit the pro-survival processes and mechanisms of drug resistance (i.e., AR-signaling and autophagy). Proteome analysis suggested a disruption of the mitochondria/oxidative phosphorylation, which was validated by further functional analysis: thus, mitochondria depolarization, elevated levels of cytotoxic ROS, an increase of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio as well as release of mitochondrial AIF and cytochrome C to cytoplasm were observed. In conclusion, glucose-conjugated 1,4-naphthoquinones show potent activity and selectivity in human CRPC exerted via mitochondrial targeting. The compounds can overcome drug resistance against current standard therapies and suppress pro-survival mechanisms. This unique combination of properties makes them new promising candidates for the treatment of CRPC.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>1,4-naphthoquinones</kwd><kwd>castration-resistant prostate cancer</kwd><kwd>Warburg effect</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-cancers-11-01690"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Despite continuous progress in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer resistance development remains a major challenge during the course of treatment with decreasing response rates and reduced progression free and overall survival with each additional treatment line [<xref rid="B1-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Thus, cross resistance has been observed between androgen receptor targeting therapies with a &#x0003e; 50% PSA decline of only 4% when abiraterone is applied after enzalutamide [<xref rid="B2-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Conventional chemotherapies can cause severe side effects due to a lack of sensitivity and specificity limiting the use especially in patients with comorbid conditions, a poor performance status and/or high chronological age [<xref rid="B3-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Consequently, there is a high medical need for novel anticancer drugs characterized by innovative mechanisms of action and increased selectivity in prostate cancer. </p><p>Tumor cells exhaust more energy for proliferation than normal cells by consuming excessive amounts of glucose via overexpressed sugar binding and transporting receptors (mainly GLUTs) [<xref rid="B4-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Interestingly, even in aerobic conditions the cancer cells prefer glycolysis followed by lactate fermentation over more energetically efficient oxidative phosphorylation. This process which was called &#x0201c;aerobic glycolysis&#x0201d; leads to the generation of extra amounts of metabolites, which may be beneficial for the rapidly proliferating cancer cells [<xref rid="B5-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This phenomenon known as the &#x0201c;Warburg effect&#x0201d; attracts attention as one of the promising strategies for specific tumor targeting. Thus, binding of small cytotoxic &#x0201c;warhead&#x0201d; molecules to sugar residues may increase selectivity due to the higher uptake by cancerous cells [<xref rid="B4-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Glufosfamide was the first sugar-conjugated compound which has been synthesized [<xref rid="B7-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], successfully passed several clinical trials [<xref rid="B8-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and is currently undergoing Phase III trials in metastatic pancreatic cancer. Remarkably, the glycosylated derivatives of several cytotoxic drugs, e.g., chlorambucil, busulfan, docetaxel and paclitaxel have been found to be less toxic to normal cells than their parent aglycons [<xref rid="B9-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Due to the chemical reactivity of the hydroxyl group at C1 of glucose (glycoside hydroxyl) most of these derivatives were synthesized as glycosides (i.e., conjugated at C1 position) [<xref rid="B9-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For such prodrug compounds it has been shown that after entering the cells via GLUT receptors (mainly GLUT-1) the glycoside bond is hydrolyzed. Thus, the glucose residue is eliminated and consequently metabolized either via anaerobic or aerobic pathway (the latest involves Krebs cycle which takes place in the mitochondria matrix). While the unconjugated active aglycon (drug) further exerts its cytotoxic action inside the cancer cell [<xref rid="B4-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Despite the progress in synthetic chemistry and computational biology up to 50% of the drugs used nowadays in clinic (particular in oncology) have been created on the basis of natural products [<xref rid="B10-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These molecules are frequently characterized by unique physiological properties. Synthetic modification and structure optimization may further increase selectivity and decrease toxic side effects [<xref rid="B10-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the current study, we identified derivatives of several natural compounds with a 1,4-naphthoquinone structural moiety which showed promising cytotoxic activity in CRPC cell lines harboring different resistance patterns. Remarkably, a quinone moiety is present in different standard chemotherapies, e.g., dactinomycin, mitomycin-C and anthracyclines [<xref rid="B11-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. 1,4-Naphthoquinones, being the most important and widely distributed chemical class in the quinones, exhibit anticancer as well as antiallergic, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiplatelet, antiviral, lipoxygenase, radical scavenging and anti-ringworm activities [<xref rid="B11-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Despite the pronounced anticancer activity the mechanism of action is still poorly understood [<xref rid="B11-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Inhibition of topoisomerase-II [<xref rid="B13-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] as well as formation of semiquinones and superoxide radicals resulting in dsDNA breaks [<xref rid="B15-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] have been reported for some of these compounds (reviewed in [<xref rid="B11-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). Recently, we showed that cell death induced by 1,4-naphthoquinones may have a p53-independent character [<xref rid="B16-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. </p><p>Thus, in order to increase selectivity of the identified 1,4-naphthoquinones by Warburg effect targeting we further generated glucose derivatives of these compounds. For this purpose we used a new modified alkylation reaction of 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinones with 6-deoxy-6- iodo-1,2:3,5-di-O-isopropylidene-&#x003b1;-D-glucofuranose. This reaction is a more efficient variant compared to transesterification of methoxynaphthazarin derivatives, which has been recently reported by us [<xref rid="B16-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, we were able to synthesize chimera molecules which possess a 1,4-naphthoquinone &#x0201c;warhead&#x0201d; moiety and a glucose residue, conjugated to each other via unusual non-glycoside bond. Three groups of the molecules were generated, namely diprotected [diisopropylidene derivatives which have no unsubstituted (no free) hydroxyl groups in the glucose moiety, e.g., compound 2], monoprotected [monoisopropylidene derivatives which have two unsubstituted hydroxyl groups in the glucose moiety, e.g., compound <bold>3</bold>) and unprotected conjugated [free-glucose derivatives, glucose moiety has four unsubstituted hydroxyl group, e.g., compound <bold>4</bold>]. Here, we report on the synthesis, anticancer activity and mechanism of action as well as on Warburg effect guided selectivity in CRPC of new quinone-carbohydrate conjugates <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-cancers-11-01690"><title>2.

Conjugates, containing unprotected glucose (4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28), were synthesized by trifluoroacetic acid hydrolysis of monoprotected glucose conjugates. For further biological studies, we used the methyl ethers of the corresponding quinone derivatives as &#x0201c;reference&#x0201d; compounds&#x02013;molecules containing active 1,4-naphthoquinone core and non-glucose substituted (compounds <bold>1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25</bold>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-cancers-11-01690"><title>2.3.

The deletion of glucose from the culture media caused increased cytotoxicity of the tested compounds in both PC-3 and 22Rv1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). Moreover, glucose uptake in human prostate cancer PC-3 and 22Rv1 cells was inhibited by the synthesized compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f002">Figure 2</xref>C). These results could be well explained by the competitive binding of glucose and the investigated substances to GLUT-1. This is another strong evidence that the synthesized conjugates reveal affinity to GLUT-1 and are capable of targeting this pathway.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-cancers-11-01690"><title>2.5. Effect on Prostate Cancer Cell Proliferation, Colony Formation and Viability</title><p>We have further examined the anticancer <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of the most promising compounds in human drug-resistant 22Rv1 cells. 22Rv1 cells express both AR full length (AR-FL) as well as AR-V7, whereas PC-3 cells are AR-FL- and AR-V7-negative [<xref rid="B20-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus, 22Rv1 cells are suitable for monitoring of the both AR-FL- and AR-V7-mediated signaling [<xref rid="B20-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, for the further experiments 22Rv1 cells were chosen as a main model, which is probably more clinically-relevant in comparison with PC-3 cells. </p><p>Thus, all four selected conjugates <bold>7, 8, 11</bold>, and <bold>12</bold> were able to suppress cancer cell colony formation of AR-V7-positive 22Rv1 cells from single cells treated with non-cytotoxic concentrations for 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). The anti-proliferative activity was determined by trypan blue exclusion assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). Interestingly, the IC<sub>50</sub>s determined with trypan blue exclusion assay for compounds <bold>7</bold> and <bold>11</bold> (monoprotected glucose conjugates) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f003">Figure 3</xref>B) were higher in comparison with the values estimated using MTT test, whereas for compounds <bold>8</bold> and <bold>12</bold> (unprotected glucose-quinone conjugates) the values were comparable. It is known that MTT tests access the metabolic activity of the cells [<xref rid="B21-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], whereas trypan blue exclusion assays differentiate between the cells with intact or disrupted cellular membrane [<xref rid="B22-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This suggests that monoprotected glucose conjugates <bold>7</bold> and <bold>11</bold> may primary suppress cancer cell metabolism, while non-protected glucose conjugates <bold>8</bold> and <bold>12</bold> may have higher membranotropic activity. Of note, no effect on the cell cycle progression was observed for 22Rv1 cells treated with any of the four tested compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f003">Figure 3</xref>C).</p><p>The apoptosis-inducing activity of the compounds was examined by flow cytometry.

Analysis of Changes in Proteome of Cancer Cells under Treatment With Synthesized Compounds</title><p>A global proteome screening approach was applied to further analyze the mode of action and molecular targets of the synthesized compounds. For this analysis the effect of the cytotoxic concentrations of compound <bold>11</bold> (most active conjugate in previous experiments) on the proteome of 22Rv1 cells was examined using the LC-MS/MS technique in data independent acquisition (DIA) mode. In total, 2163 proteins were quantified across all samples. 274 proteins had 1.5 &#x02264; fold change &#x02264; 1/1.5 and were significantly regulated (p &#x02264; 0.05) (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cancers-11-01690">Supplementary Information, Table S5</xref>). We identified 92 proteins out of this pool with increased expressional levels (upregulation) and 182 with decreased expressional levels (downregulation) following the treatment. To analyze the proteomics data we used the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis tool (IPA, QIAGEN Bioinformatics, Redwood, CA, USA). Gene ontology, functional analyses as well as pathway network analyses were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f004">Figure 4</xref>A&#x02013;D). z-Score algorithm was used to predict the direction of alteration for the current activity or function: positive values indicate activation, negative values indicate suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f004">Figure 4</xref>B,C). Interestingly, the majority of the proteins regulated under the treatment were enzymes localized in cytoplasm and nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). The activity of several important cancer-relevant upstream regulator molecules was predicted to be affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). Among them, up-stream tyrosine kinase receptor ErbB-2 [<xref rid="B28-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], Rab-like protein 6 (RABL6) [<xref rid="B29-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) [<xref rid="B30-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which are involved in progression and development of several types of cancer were predicted to be suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). In addition, canonical EIF2 and NER pathway as well as oxidative phosphorylation were predicted to be suppressed, while LXR/RXR, sirtuin, sumolaytion, ILK, RhoA, actic cytoskeleton signaling and NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response were activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). Note, the IPA analysis predicted an activation of androgen receptor under the drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f003">Figure 3</xref>G). However, we previously demonstrated the down-regulation of AR-FL as well as AR-V7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f003">Figure 3</xref>G). AR may be activated by phosphorylation, whereas the down-regulation/degradation of the total AR may eventually lead to the ultimate and general inhibition of AR signaling [<xref rid="B31-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These events may appear independently from each other and thus will be further analyzed.</p><p>Five top hypothetical protein interaction networks were constructed using IPA software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f004">Figure 4</xref>D). Treatment with compound <bold>11</bold> was predicted to affect kinases JNK1/2, p38, ERK1/2, MEK1/2, and Akt. Consequently, these kinases were placed in central positions of the networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f004">Figure 4</xref>D, marked with red target sign). To verify this hypothesis western blotting analyses were performed. As many stress kinases are known to be often activated shortly after stimulation, we used a short-term treatment of 2 h in order to validate the predicted alterations and elucidate their possible role as an early biochemical event following the treatment. Indeed, in line with the IPA analysis a pronounced activation of two main stress MAPKs&#x02013;p38 and JNK1/2, as well as slight Akt activation were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f004">Figure 4</xref>E), while pro-survival ERK1/2 was suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f004">Figure 4</xref>E).

Thus, we investigated the effect of compound <bold>11</bold>, as well as of structurally-related compound <bold>7</bold>, on mitochondria of human prostate cancer cells. First, the effect on the ROS level, which is often associated with the disruption of mitochondrial integrity (reviewed in [<xref rid="B33-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]), was examined. Indeed, a remarkable and significant increase of the ROS level was observed already after 2 h of treatment in 22Rv1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f005">Figure 5</xref>A,B).

Indeed, a quick &#x00394;&#x003a8;m loss was detected in 22Rv1 cells after 2 h of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f005">Figure 5</xref>D,E). In line with this finding, we observed a release of mitochondrial proteins, namely apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and cytochrome C into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f005">Figure 5</xref>F). This was associated with an induction of two apoptotic markers, i.e., PARP- and caspase-3-cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f005">Figure 5</xref>F) and therefore may also contribute to induction of the drug-induced apoptosis. Remarkably, CCCP&#x02013;a well-established mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler&#x02013;exhibited comparable effects on &#x00394;&#x003a8;m and mitochondrial proteins release like compounds <bold>7</bold> and <bold>11,</bold> suggesting a similar mode of action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f005">Figure 5</xref>D&#x02013;F).

Discussion</title><p>Increased selectivity and efficacy can be achieved by linking cytotoxic anticancer drugs to specific target/carrier molecules [<xref rid="B9-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Successful examples of this treatment strategy are antibody-drug conjugates, which target cancer cells due to increased expression of specific proteins [<xref rid="B34-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and folate conjugates, which utilize a commonly high expression of the folate receptor (FR) on the surface of different human cancer cells [<xref rid="B35-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Warburg effect targeting is another promising strategy for the design and synthesis of new cytotoxic anticancer drugs. Here, the conjugation of sugar residues to cytotoxic drugs shall increase selectivity to cancerous tissues and reduce side effects in patients due to a higher sugar uptake by the cancer cells [<xref rid="B4-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B9-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. To date one sugar-conjugated molecule glufosfamide is in clinical development for the treatment of lung, ovary, pancreatic, brain and CNS cancer as well as soft tissue sarcoma [<xref rid="B36-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In addition, different sugar-conjugated molecules are currently evaluated preclinically [<xref rid="B4-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B9-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In prostate cancer Warburg effect was observed specifically in metastatic tumors which makes glucose-derived chemotherapeutics promising in the treatment of metastatic CRPC [<xref rid="B37-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In our research, we found the derivatives of natural 1,4-naphtoquinone compounds to be active in drug-resistant prostate cancer cells. Preliminary data, however, have shown that these substances are also rather cytotoxic for non-cancerous cells, suggesting undesired side effects <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, we utilized the Warburg effect in order to increase the selectivity of the compounds towards tumor cells. We synthesized hybrid molecules, which contain selected natural 1,4-naphtoquinone moieties conjugated with glucose residues via non-glycoside bond at C6 position. The non-glycoside nature of the conjugates was chosen in order to provide the highest affinity to glucose transporters located in the cellular membrane. It is known that the presence of free unsubstituted glycoside hydroxyl (at C1 position) is important for the stabilization of hydrogen bonding interactions with GLUT-1 and therefore is required for the successful cellular uptake of the sugar-conjugated molecules [<xref rid="B38-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In contrast, the hydroxyl at C6 position of glucose molecule is not relevant for the hydrogen bond interactions and therefore it&#x02019;s substitution may be more tolerable [<xref rid="B38-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In fact, the affinity of glucose with substituted C6-OH to GLUT-1 was reported to be almost equal to its unsubstituted analogues [<xref rid="B39-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, instead of a conventional glycosylation reaction (results in C1-substituted glucose) we applied a new reaction of alkylation of 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinones with 6-deoxy-6-iodo-1,2:3,5-di-O- isopropylidene-&#x003b1;-D-glucofuranose (results in a C6-substituted glucose). This reaction was more efficient in comparison with transesterification reaction of 2-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinones, which was recently discovered by us [<xref rid="B16-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B40-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Thus, we synthesized a series of 6-(1,4-naphtoquinonyl)-D-glucose conjugates containing diprotected, monoprotected, or unprotected glucose residues.</p><p>In line with our hypotheses the glucose-conjugated compounds revealed higher selectivity towards five human prostate cancer cell lines compared with five non-cancerous lines. The successful targeting of the Warburg effect by the newly synthesized glucose derivatives is strongly suggested by the following findings: (a) correlation of cytotoxicity and selectivity of the synthesized conjugates with higher expression of GLUT-1 in human prostate cancer cells; (b) inhibition of cytotoxicity of the conjugates by addition of glucose to the media; c) ability of the compounds to inhibit a glucose uptake by cancer cells. In general, the binding of the quinone core with the glucose moiety lead to an increased water solubility and selectivity. However, at the same time it resulted in an absolute cytotoxicity decrease when compared to methoxy derivatives, most probably due to the increased polarity of the molecule. It should also be noted that normal prostate cells are known to have an active glycolysis and also consume significant amount of glucose (reviewed in [<xref rid="B37-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]). Thus, these cells may also be affected by the Warburg effect targeting therapeutics in vivo. However, frequently patients with advanced prostate cancer have had local treatment for their primary tumors leaving no vital tissue behind. In the patients cytoreduction of the remaining prostate tissue maybe a pleasant side effect in order to avoid local complications.</p><p>The four most promising compounds were selected for further examinations of activity and the mechanism of action. Namely, conjugates <bold>11</bold> and <bold>12</bold> belonging to the structural family of 8-hydroxy-1,4-naphtoquinone-2-yl (3-hydroxyjuglone) derivatives and containing monoprotected and free glucose, respectively, as well as conjugates <bold>7</bold> and <bold>8</bold>, which belong to the structural family of 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphtoquinone-2-yl (2-hydroxyjuglone) derivatives. These compounds exhibited pronounced anticancer activity, executed via induction of p21- and caspase-related apoptotic tumor cell death, and were able to suppress the colony formation of cancer cells (<italic>in vitro</italic> prototype of the anti-metastatic activity). Note, despite of the observed up-regulation of p21 no significant cell cycle arrest was found, which could be a cell specific phenomenon; whereas the p21 down-regulation detected at the higher concentrations of the drugs maybe a result of protein degradation driven by cell death associated processes. Interestingly, monoprotected conjugates <bold>7</bold> and <bold>11</bold> may have slightly different effects on cancer cells primarily targeting the metabolism, whereas free glucose containing conjugates <bold>8</bold> and <bold>12</bold> rather have a membranolitic activity. All four compounds effectively suppressed pro-survival processes, associated with drug resistance of prostate cancer cells. Thus, inhibition of cytoprotective autophagy, down-regulation of expression of anti-apoptotic protein survivin as well as suppression of AR- and AR-V7-dependent signaling (via down-regulation/degradation of both androgen receptors) were observed. Drug resistance remains a major challenge in prostate cancer treatment. Up to 30% of patients with CRPC are preliminary resistant to the first line drugs and basically all the patients over time eventually develop drug resistance to applied therapeutics [<xref rid="B41-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Up-regulated autophagy was found in a number of prostate cancer tumors and therefore is considered to be an important resistance mechanism to chemo- and radiotherapies in CRPC [<xref rid="B23-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Expression of AR-V7 has recently emerged to be an important mechanism of resistance to androgen receptor targeting therapies such as abiraterone and enzalutamide [<xref rid="B27-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B42-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Thus, novel therapeutics which are able to overcome drug resistance and reveal cytotoxic activity at the same time are of high value and interest. It is important to note that no correlation of the drug-sensitivity and the cellular AR status has been observed; e.g., 22Rv1 (AR<sup>+</sup>, AR-V7<sup>+</sup>) and DU145 (AR<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, AR-V7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) cells were more sensitive to the tested compounds in comparison with VCaP (AR<sup>+</sup>, AR-V7<sup>+</sup>) and PC-3 (AR<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, AR-V7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f001">Figure 1</xref>D), whereas LNCaP cells (AR<sup>+</sup>, AR-V7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, hormone therapy sensitive) exhibited an average sensitivity level. Thus, hormone therapy resistant prostate cancer cells exhibit no cross-resistance to the investigated conjugated.</p><p>Further examinations on the mode of action were performed for conjugate <bold>11</bold> using global proteome analysis. Conjugate <bold>11</bold> was chosen because it was the most promising out of the synthesized compounds based on the results of cytotoxicity and selectivity profile analyses. Using consequent bioinformatical analysis we were able to predict and further validate an activation of pro-apoptotic MAPK, namely p38 and JNK1/2 as well as Akt, while ERK1/2, playing an important role in a number of pro-survival processes was suppressed. This may further contribute to the ability of the substance to overcome drug resistance. Further analysis of proteomics data suggested treatment-mediated alteration of oxidative phosphorylation, which takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Indeed, we were able to further confirm the targeting of mitochondria of the cancer cells and showed an elevation of the cytotoxic ROS levels as well as release of the cytotoxic mitochondrial proteins AIF and cytochrome C to cytoplasm. Simultaneously, we observed an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, which is known to lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, followed by cytochrome C release and caspases activation, both ultimately leading to apoptosis (reviewed in [<xref rid="B43-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]). Importantly, the drop down of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential (&#x00394;&#x003c8;<sub>m</sub>), ROS up-regulation and cleavage of caspase-9 were observed after only 2 h following the treatment. Caspase-9 is an initiator caspase, which is activated (cleaved) in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis and later leads to the activation of effector caspase-3 (reviewed in [<xref rid="B43-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]). The cleavage of caspase-9 prior to caspase-3 proves a canonical character of the caspases activation by the synthesized compounds and confirms that the activation is not an unspecific event resulting from cell death. Finally, mitochondrial targeting by conjugates <bold>7</bold> and <bold>11</bold> also explains the difference in IC<sub>50</sub>s generated with MTT and trypan blue exclusion assays for these compounds. The readout of MTT assay depends on the mitochondrial activity, and disruption/suppression of this activity prior to the cellular membrane rupture may therefore be detected by MTT assay, but not by trypan blue exclusion assay. Remarkably, cytotoxic activity of the compounds was also observed after 2 h treatment with the drugs in 22Rv1 cells. However, IC<sub>50</sub> values were distinctly higher than after 48 h (IC<sub>50</sub> = 24.2 &#x000b5;M, 92.39 &#x000b5;M, 20.45 &#x000b5;M, and 94.85 &#x000b5;M for conjugated <bold>7</bold>, <bold>8</bold>, <bold>11</bold>, and <bold>12</bold>, respectively, after 2 h or treatment). Thus, following the 2 h treatment the cytotoxic events has been already initiated but yet not completely exerted. This is in line with the detection of delayed effector caspase-3 activation, which occurs after longer treatment time (&#x0003e;2 h).</p><p>Anticancer drugs specifically targeting mitochondria attracted attention in the last 10 years and attempts have been made in order to introduce mitochondrial targeting moieties into existing drugs [<xref rid="B44-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Remarkably, these drugs were reported to be more effective than their parental molecules (e.g., fluorouracil conjugated with selective mitochondria-localized moiety F16 [<xref rid="B45-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]) and some were reported to be able to overcome drug resistance [<xref rid="B44-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B46-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Recently, it has been demonstrated that oxidative phosphorylation is up-regulated in different cancer entities, including prostate cancer (specifically in primary tumors) [<xref rid="B32-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B37-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Moreover, its correlation with hormone resistance of prostate cancer cells has been reported (reviewed in [<xref rid="B47-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]). Consequently, the interest to inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation, as a novel emerging target, has greatly increased [<xref rid="B32-cancers-11-01690" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. During glycolysis the glucose molecule breaks down to pyruvate, which is later transported to mitochondria and further oxidized in Krebs cycle. Thus, inside of a living cell the quinone-conjugated glucose residue may be converted to pyruvate which can be further specifically delivered to mitochondria. Therefore, mitochondria targeting by the synthesized compounds could be promoted by their glucose-conjugate nature. Of note, the non-glycoside bond in these molecules cannot be easily hydrolyzed by the cytoplasmatic enzymes, hence the &#x0201c;warhead&#x0201d; quinone moieties may enter mitochondria still being glucose/pyruvate-conjugated which again contributes to their specificity.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-cancers-11-01690"><title>4.

Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we found natural 1,4-naphtoquinone derivatives with promising anti-cancer activity in human drug-resistant prostate cancer cells and synthesized new glucose derivatives (6-O-(1,4-naphtaquinone-2-yl)-D-glucose conjugates) with improved selectivity. The compounds exhibited selective cytotoxicity in human prostate cancer cells due to a higher uptake rate, which most likely results from the Warburg effect. The glucose conjugates were able to overcome cancer cell drug resistance and suppress pro-survival mechanisms. Cytotoxic activity is executed via primary intracellular targeting of cancer cell mitochondria leading to cytotoxic ROS production as well as to AIF and cytochrome C release to cytoplasm, which results in caspase-9 and -3 activation and ultimately leads to apoptotic death of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01690-f005">Figure 5</xref>I).
