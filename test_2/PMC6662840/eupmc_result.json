    "Keratins are the main cytoskeletal proteins of epithelial cells and changes in the expression of keratins have contributed to the evolutionary adaptation of epithelia to different environments. Keratin K24 was proposed to be a differentiation marker of epidermal keratinocytes but the significance of K24 expression in the epidermis versus other tissues has remained elusive. Here, we show by RT-PCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence analyses that K24 is highly expressed in the epithelium of the cornea whereas its expression levels are significantly lower in other stratified epithelia including in the epidermis. To investigate the evolutionary history of K24, we screened the genome sequences of vertebrates for orthologs of the human KRT24 gene. The results of this comparative genomics study suggested that KRT24 originated in a common ancestor of amniotes and that it was lost independently in three clades of mammals, i.e. camels, cetaceans, and a subclade of pinnipeds comprising eared seals and the walrus. Together, the results of this study identify K24 as component of the cytoskeleton in the human corneal epithelium and reveal previously unknown differences of keratin gene content among mammalian species."
