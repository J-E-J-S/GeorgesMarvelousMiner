Despite the existence of functional genomics screens for proliferation and toxicity, neuronal signalling has been difficult to address so far. To overcome this limitation, we developed a pooled screening assay which combines barcoded activity reporters with pooled genetic perturbation in a dual-expression adeno-associated virus (AAV) library. With this approach, termed pathScreener, we comprehensively dissect signalling pathways in postmitotic neurons. This overcomes several limitations of lentiviral-based screens. By applying first a barcoded and multiplexed reporter assay, termed cisProfiler, we identified the synaptic-activity responsive element (SARE) as top performance sensor of neuronal activity. Next, we targeted more than 4,400 genes and screened for modulatory effects on SARE activity in primary cortical neurons. We identified with high replicability many known genes involved in glutamatergic synapse-to-nucleus signalling of which a subset was validated in orthogonal assays. Several others have not yet been associated with the regulation of neuronal activity such as the hedgehog signalling members <italic>Ptch2</italic> and <italic>Ift57</italic>. This assay thus enhances the toolbox for analysing regulatory processes during neuronal signalling and may help identifying novel targets for brain disorders.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO 4076/5-1</award-id><award-id>RO 4076/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rossner</surname><given-names>Moritz J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Functional genomics screens are the gold-standard for dissecting gene networks at the genome-wide level and contribute to target identification and mode-of-action studies in the biomedical field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

Unfortunately, these screening protocols are not suitable for the study of signalling in postmitotic cell types like primary neurons, as many disease-related neuronal phenotypes rely more on cell-to-cell communication (e.g. synaptic transmission) and the formation of complex morphologies and networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Existing protocols require high cell numbers per individual perturbation to gain sensitivity and robustness, but cell numbers are very limited for most primary postmitotic cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.

Therefore, a panel of 70 cis-regulatory pathway reporters was generated to identify a sensor with excellent performance in a given cellular paradigm. The library consists of clustered transcription factor binding sites, enhancers, or short promoters coupled to a luciferase reporter and individually to unique RNA barcodes which we collectively term cisProfiler (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).

AAV particles have a natural tropism for neuronal cells and do not elicit cytotoxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In addition, AAV-based systems have been extensively investigated for human gene therapy purposes and the availability of many natural as well as synthetic capsid proteins allows broad applications in many different tissues and cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the AAV genome persists extrachromosomally which avoids effects on reporter performance depending on the genomic locus as with integrated lentiviruses. The AAV screening vector presented here was designed as a dual-expression vector containing the E-SARE reporter (=sensor component) and the shRNA cassette (=effector component) in opposing directions yielding the final sensor-effector coupled design (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The E-SARE reporter is driving the expression of the Firefly luciferase (luc2) and a 35&#x02009;bp barcode sequence (BC) in response to neuronal activity as in the cisProfiler assay (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The shRNA is constitutively expressed by a human U6 promoter, which performed better compared to neuronal promoters (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). We verified that the proximity of the shRNA expression cassette does not affect the E-SARE sensor performance (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). Run-through transcripts from the hU6 promoter due to insufficient termination have been a concern, as they would bias the barcode pool for sequencing if transcribed into cDNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. A comparison of random primers with oligo(dT) primers for cDNA synthesis indicated that the oligo(dT) primers are superior in this set-up and we show that transcriptional run-through by RNA polymerase is not interfering with the assay (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">S4</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Pooled sensor-effector coupled interference screen in cortical neurons.

Thereby, deep sequencing of the barcode pool during screening is sufficient to identify the corresponding shRNA and to measure the sensor activity simultaneously. We performed two screens with 2&#x02013;3 replicates per condition. For each replicate sample, 10 or 5 million primary cortical neurons plated on 15 or 10&#x02009;cm dishes, termed screen A and B respectively, were infected with the AAV library pool at an infection rate of ~60% at day-<italic>in-vitro</italic> (DIV) 6 avoiding multiple infections per cell (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">S6</xref>).

Half of the cultures were subsequently silenced using a TTX cocktail to reduce the E-SARE activity to baseline level to quantify the relative abundance of each functional library vector. In the remaining cultures, network activity was stimulated by a BIC cocktail in order to reveal genes which participate in neuronal activity-dependent signalling (see Methods for details). From each sample, total RNA was purified, and barcode pools were prepared for deep sequencing. The effect of each gene knockdown on E-SARE activity was determined by comparing all barcodes of the stimulated samples with each other after normalization to the silenced reference samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). It was expected that a knockdown of a positive regulator of activity-dependent neuronal signalling will decrease the relative E-SARE activity, whereas a knockdown of a negative regulator will increase the relative E-SARE activity. The induction of the E-SARE activity upon stimulation of synaptic activity by BIC was monitored in sister cultures by live cell online luciferase recordings (21 fold-change, BIC vs TTX) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c,d</xref>). The induction of barcode expression from the E-SARE reporter in the actual screening samples was also controlled using relative quantification by qRT-PCR of all barcodes in the library (29 fold-change, BIC vs TTX) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). Normalized read counts of replicate samples from two screens (&#x02018;A&#x02019; with 10 million and &#x02018;B&#x02019; with 5 million cells per sample) highly correlated within conditions, highlighting the robustness of the screening technology (Pearson correlation coefficient &#x003c1;&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.985 BIC; &#x003c1;&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.972 TTX) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>).

In contrast, we could show that the design of sensor-effector coupling gives sensitive and robust readouts, leading to a high degree of reproducibility across screens and avoiding any cell sorting induced bias<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, Kramer <italic>et al</italic>. identified so far unknown modulators of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-related neurodegeneration, highlighting the importance of genomics screens in neuronal systems. With the increasing interest in primary cell cultures for functional genomics screens, the aspects of cell heterogeneity as well as network- versus cell-intrinsic effects are new topics to the field and require consideration during data interpretation. This is of importance for neuronal cultures where many cells (and different cell types, see below) interact and modulate each other. A pooled screen with a neuronal network is always limited to cell-intrinsic effects of the genetic interference, as only a fraction of cells will have a certain gene-specific phenotype. However, during orthogonal validation it is possible to discriminate between cell-intrinsic and network level effects by infecting at low versus high titers and analysing shRNA and non-shRNA infected neurons with control conditions. Cell heterogeneity leads to screening results that are rather generic across all cell types within a culture. This also applies to the primary mouse cultures used here, even though most cells are excitatory neurons. To allow a more precise cell type focused analysis, the pathScreener approach could be combined with a genetic label such as Cre-recombinase or FACS purified cell populations.</p><p id="Par18">With over 4,400 targets included within our library, it allowed us to screen an unprecedented number of genes in primary cortical neurons and to retrieve many known and unknown modulators of neuronal activity. Notably, we successfully screened at much lower cell numbers per shRNA than the standard for pooled screens (250 vs &#x0003e;1,000 cells per shRNA/sgRNA). Despite this low cell to shRNA ratio, replicate correlations were outperforming those of a FACS-based signalling screen in dendritic cells and those of the above mentioned toxicity screen in neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par19">The reproducibility and depth of the network deconvolution are likely to be further increased using CRISPR/Cas9 libraries.

As a trade-off, CRISPR/Cas9 screens essentially dependent on the co-expression of a Cas9 effector-mediating protein (e.g. in neurons) which is not needed for RNAi. Nevertheless, RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 screens should be considered as complementary approaches, as both seem to have advantages in identifying distinct classes of genes in certain screening paradigms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. In particular, if functional genomics screens are performed towards drug target identification, a gene knockdown might more likely phenocopy a drug action than a knockout<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">This proof-of-concept screen did already identify a reasonable number of primary hits without published association with neuronal function or contributions to mental disorders.
