The accuracy and reproducibility of the multiple small RNA-seq library preparation methods in use, however, have not been systematically assessed. We report systematic results obtained by a consortium of nine labs that independently sequenced reference, &#x02018;ground truth&#x02019;, samples of synthetic small RNAs and human plasma-derived RNA. Three commercially available library preparation methods employing adapters of defined sequence and six methods using adapters with degenerate bases were assessed. Both protocol- and sequence-specific biases were identified, including biases that reduce the ability of small RNA-seq to accurately measure adenosine-to-inosine editing in microRNAs. We report that these biases were mitigated by library preparation methods that incorporate adapters with degenerate bases. MicroRNA relative quantification between samples using small RNA-seq was found to be accurate and reproducible across laboratories and methods.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">RNA-seq has transformed transcriptome characterization in a wide range of biological contexts <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. RNA-seq can be used to sequence long reads (long RNA-seq; e.g., messenger RNAs and long non-coding RNAs) and short RNAs (small RNA-seq; e.g. small non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs). These applications differ in terms of the size of the targeted RNAs, but also by the technical methods used and the resulting biases in the quantitative data produced<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. For example, preparation of libraries for long RNA-seq, by virtue of having sufficiently long target RNA lengths, commonly utilizes primers for direct generation of cDNA from RNA. In contrast, small RNA-seq library preparation methods typically require RNA ligation or poly-A tailing steps to overcome the challenge of performing reverse transcription and subsequent PCR amplification from extremely short (e.g., 16-30 nt) target RNA sequences.</p><p id="P3">Multiple approaches have been developed to overcome the challenge of uniformly and robustly generating cDNA from small RNAs for the purpose of small RNA-seq<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Protocols in use for small RNA-seq therefore vary more widely than those used for long RNA-seq, creating greater potential for variation from different library preparation protocols and different labs. In addition, small RNA-seq is increasingly used to study samples with very low RNA concentration, such as biofluids containing exosomes, other extracellular vesicles (EV)<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and RNA-protein complexes<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Normalization methods<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> developed to correct for variation in long RNA-seq data are typically not well suited for small RNA-seq data. Whereas performance characteristics such as reproducibility and quantitative accuracy have been well studied for long RNA-seq<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, only the reproducibility of a single library preparation protocol has been evaluated<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Furthermore, the performance of different small RNA-seq methods for quantifying single nucleotide changes in RNA sequence, such as those seen with microRNA (miRNA) editing, for example, has not been systematically examined. Yet, with the rapid accumulation of small RNA-seq data (e.g., NIH short-reads archive<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, EV-associated small RNA sequencing databases<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, TCGA<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, the exRNA Atlas,<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> etc.), meaningful, quantitative interpretation of results, especially across studies, would benefit from a systematic examination of technical bias, its effects on accuracy and of the reproducibility of small RNA-seq.</p><p id="P5">Here, we report a study led by investigators from the NIH-funded Extracellular RNA Communication Consortium<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> involving nine laboratories, which performed a systematic multi-protocol, multi-institution assessment of the accuracy, reproducibility and technical bias of small RNA-seq using standardized, synthetic reference reagents. We evaluated the performance of different protocols with respect to characterizing miRNA editing and identified a library preparation approach that reduces technical bias, improving the accuracy and comparability of small RNA-seq results.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="S1"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Study design and standard reference materials for miRNA quantification</title><p id="P6">In order to evaluate the performance of small RNA-seq library preparation protocols across multiple laboratories, we developed standard reference samples as well as a standardized study design (shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). We distributed detailed instructions for library preparation and sequencing to each lab, along with four reference RNA samples (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>): i) an equimolar pool comprising 1,152 synthetic RNA oligonucleotides, corresponding predominantly to human miRNA sequences, as well as a small set of non-miRNA oligonucleotides of varied sequence and length (15-90 nt); ii) two synthetic small RNA pools, called ratiometric pools SynthA and SynthB, each containing the same 334 synthetic RNAs, but in which subsets of RNAs vary in relative amount between pools A and B by 15 different ratios, ranging from 10:1 to 1:10; and iii) RNA isolated from human blood plasma pooled from 11 individuals.</p><p id="P7">The common materials were distributed to nine participating research groups (Laurent lab, UCSD; Erle lab, UCSF, Ghiran lab, BIDMC/DFCI; Nolte-&#x02019;t Hoen lab, UUTR; Freedman lab, UMass; Wang lab, ISB; Galas lab, PNRI; Van Keuren-Jensen lab, TGen and Tewari lab, U. of Michigan). Nine library preparation protocols were evaluated (<bold><italic>Online Methods)</italic></bold>, wherein at least one group prepared and sequenced quadruplicate libraries from each of the reference samples. Three of the protocols&#x02013;TruSeq (Illumina), NEBNext (New England Biolabs) and CleanTag (Trilink Biotech)&#x02013;are commercial kits that employ adapters with invariant sequences. The remaining protocols make use of adapters with 4 degenerate nucleotides at the ligation end as a strategy to reduce the bias, and we collectively call these &#x0201c;4N&#x0201d; protocols in this study. These six 4N protocols included: (i) a commercial kit, NEXTflex (Bioo Scientific), (ii) a recently published protocol<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>, and (iii) four variants of a protocol developed by members of the consortium (protocols 4N_A, B, C and D) that we collective refer to as &#x0201c;in-house&#x0201d; 4N methods. The TruSeq kit served as the common reference kit for this study, and was evaluated by all the groups using Illumina sequencing platforms (8 out of 9 groups). In addition, multiple labs generated libraries using the NEBNext kit (6 labs) and the in-house protocol 4N_B (4 labs), thereby allowing for standardized cross-lab comparisons for these two protocols in addition to the Illumina TruSeq protocol.</p><p id="P8">In all, the nine participating groups prepared 384 libraries for miRNA quantification analysis, of which 377 (98%) were successfully sequenced and submitted for central analysis. The 7 libraries that were not successfully prepared and sequenced included four plasma pool libraries (Lab8 4N_NEXTflex), two equimolar pool libraries (Lab7 NEXTflex) and one SynthB library (Lab8 TruSeq). Together, the nine participating groups collectively contributed 5.45 billion small RNA-seq reads to the analysis (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). These sequencing data were centrally analyzed using the Genboree Workbench and its implementation of the Extracellular RNA Communication Consortium&#x02019;s ExceRpt Small RNA-seq pipeline, which is specifically designed for the analysis of small RNA-seq data and uses its own alignment and quantification engine to map and quantify a range of RNAs represented in small RNA-seq data (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref> for pipeline QC metrics). Of the 377 samples analyzed, 364 (&#x0003e;96%) satisfied minimum quality criteria (<italic>Online Methods</italic>) and were included in the analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Characterization of sequence-specific bias of small RNA-seq protocols</title><p id="P9">Out of the 1,152 synthetic RNAs, we focused on 977 5&#x02019;-phosphorylated RNAs 16-25 nt in length, which can be captured with standard small RNA-seq protocols. The efficiency of recovery of RNA sequences varied by multiple orders of magnitude depending on the protocol, confirming that small RNA-seq protocols are associated with prominent sequence-dependent bias <sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) and that the bias is greater as compared to that in long RNA-seq<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. This was highly reproducible within a given protocol, both across technical replicates and laboratories using the same protocol (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). Libraries prepared by different labs clustered first into two groups, corresponding to methods with invariant (TruSeq, NEBNext and Cleantag) or degenerate (4N) adapters. Within each of these two larger groups, the libraries then formed distinct clusters corresponding to the different protocols included in the study, indicating that the impact of the protocol bias is potentially greater than that of lab-to-lab variation. The ten most overrepresented and underrepresented sequences varied widely between protocols (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Although all protocols exhibited some bias, it was reduced in those using degenerate adapters (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). As one measure of this, we calculated the median percentage of sequences with a number of reads (i.e., counts per million) more than ten times above or below the expected value, for each protocol. This ranged from 41.6% to 61.5% for protocols using adapters with defined sequences (TruSeq: 41.6%; CleanTag: 53.9% and NEBNext: 61.5%), and from 2.8% to 22.4% for protocols using adapters with degenerate nucleotides (4N_A: 8.9%; 4N_B: 2.8%; 4N_C: 12.1%; 4N_D: 22.4%, 4N_Xu: 7.1% and 4N_NEXTflex: 17%) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). The 4N in-house protocols showed fewer missing sequences from the equimolar pool (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>) and when downsampling to compare the same number of total mapped reads across protocols, at varying sequencing depths (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). We found that with the in-house 4N_B protocol, even when downsampling to 10,000 total mapped reads, &#x0003e;90% of the miRNAs had a high probability of detection (median: 92%; range: 78-95%). In contrast, even with the best-performing invariant adapter protocol, TruSeq, &#x0003c;50% of miRNAs had a high probability of detection (median: 46%; range: 40-55%) at the same depth, indicating that the 4N_B protocol may require lower read depth to yield similar coverage as other library protocols.</p><p id="P11">We also assessed the reproducibility of small RNA cloning biases across labs by examining the rank-order of RNA sequence abundance. To do so, we calculated Spearman rank correlations for the equimolar synthetic pool counts between labs and protocols. As expected, the strongest correlations were found between technical replicates from the same lab and method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Correlations were also strong between samples generated by different labs using the same protocol (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). The somewhat lower correlation value observed for 4N_B can be attributed to the overall lower variation in read counts across miRNAs due to less cloning bias with this protocol. The reduced spread in the data limits the maximum absolute correlation coefficient values that can be obtained. This limitation notwithstanding, comparison across labs using different protocols showed much weaker correlations (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>)</p><p id="P12">To dissect the source of observed bias, we evaluated the effect of several variables (5&#x02019; or 3&#x02019; terminal bases, %GC of the four 5&#x02019; or 3&#x02019;end bases, overall %GC, dG [free energy], dH [enthalpy], dS [entropy], and Tm) on the number of obtained reads with different library preparation protocols (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 5-13</xref>). However, none of these variables substantially explained the observed bias.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Accuracy and cross-protocol concordance for relative quantification</title><p id="P13">To investigate the accuracy of relative quantification of the same small RNAs between different samples, we designed two ratiometric pools, SynthA and SynthB, each containing the same 334 synthetic RNA sequences, but varying the relative abundance of sequences between the two pools for fifteen expression ratios (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). All of the protocols tested showed close concordance between observed and expected ratios (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). We also analyzed the data using standard differential expression workflows from three commonly used R packages (EdgeR<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>, DESeq2<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> and limma/voom<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>) to determine the smallest difference in abundance that could be distinguished using small RNA-seq methods. We observed that for most protocols and for the majority of miRNAs, a difference in levels as little as 1.5-fold between the two samples could be detected (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 14</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref>, all the evaluated protocols performed relatively well in detecting miRNAs abundances.</p><p id="P14">We examining the rank-order of RNA sequence abundance and found that in general, the Spearman rank correlations results obtained for the SynthA and SynthB samples were similar to those obtained for the equimolar pool: the correlation was strong when using the same protocol, but weaker across different protocols (see left and middle heatmaps in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). In contrast, when we analyzed the concordance of the obtained SynthA/SynthB ratios (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>), we found a very strong correlation between labs not only when using the same protocol, but also across different protocols, confirming that relative quantification is resilient to variation in protocol used (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>)</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Reproducibility of small RNA-seq protocols</title><p id="P15">In order to quantify intra-lab variation for each sequence, we used two metrics, (i) coefficient of variation -CV- (standard deviation/mean) and, (ii) quartile coefficient of dispersion &#x02013;QCD- (interquartile range/average of the first and third quartile). The median CV for the equimolar pool libraries ranged from 6.18% (TruSeq) to 23.92% (CleanTag) for the different library preparation methods (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). In addition, the median QCD was &#x0003c;0.1 for all the protocols/labs (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). We also evaluated the intra-lab variation from technical replicates of sequencing the SynthA and SynthB libraries. The calculated CV and QCD values were similar to those observed for the equimolar libraries (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 15</xref>).</p><p id="P16">To characterize the reproducibility of small RNA-seq libraries across laboratories, we focused on the three protocols (TruSeq, NEBNext and 4N_B) for which libraries were generated by at least three groups. In addition, of the six labs that generated libraries using the NEBNext protocol, two of the labs used somewhat modified conditions based on options provided by the manufacturer and were excluded from the analysis (<bold><italic>Online Methods</italic></bold>).</p><p id="P17">Using the results for the equimolar pool and treating each laboratory&#x02019;s results as one trial of the experiment, we calculated the CV and QCD for the mean CPM values for each RNA sequence across laboratories.

We found that precision varied as a function of known percent editing, with greater precision observed in the 5% and 50% edited pools compared to the 0.1% and 1% pools, as expected from the higher number of edited read counts in the former pools. Across all protocols tested, for the majority of miRNAs, the precision of percent editing measurements was (i) CV: &#x0003c;5% in the 50% edited pool, &#x0003c;20% in the 5% edited pool and &#x0003c;25% in the 1% edited pool; and (ii) QCD: &#x0003c;0.3 in the 50% edited pool, &#x0003c;0.4 in the 5% edited pool and &#x0003c;0.6 in the 1% edited pool.</p><p id="P26">We evaluated the specificity and limit of detection for identifying miRNA editing by downsampling each library to 10<sup>6</sup> reads to allow standardized comparisons across libraries.

The overall median false positive rate was 0.10% across all protocols, all miRNAs and both edited and unedited false positive calls (median false positive frequencies for individual protocols: TruSeq 0.05% (edited) and 0.06% (unedited); NEBNext 0.30% (edited) and 0.14% (unedited); 4N_B 0.10% (edited) and 0.08% (unedited) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 8</xref>).

To calculate the limit of detection (LOD), we defined detection of editing as an observed edited count that is more than three standard deviations above the observed edited count in the 0% edited synthetic pool.

The observed biases are as large as 10<sup>4</sup>-fold with some commonly used commercial library preparation protocols. This sequence-dependent bias is more severe than that previously reported for long RNA-seq <sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, highlighting differences between the technologies and unique challenges involved in small RNA sequencing. Additionally, this bias can be particularly vexing when working with low RNA input samples such as biofluids, preventing the reliable detection of some low-abundance small RNAs. The in-house 4N protocols evaluated here, which employ adapters containing degenerate bases in the ligating ends, reduced the bias on the order of 100-fold and achieved better coverage at a lower sequencing depth than the widely used commercial library preparation kits with invariant adapter sequences. The magnitude of the bias observed for some sequences when using fixed adapter protocols was so high that it is likely impractical to overcome simply with increased sequencing depth. There were, however, differences in the results of different 4N methods, suggesting that not only the use of adapters with degenerate bases but also other factors in the protocols, such as the concentration of polyethylene glycol in ligation reactions, the time and temperature of ligations, etc., may also affect the bias. Our computational analyses of a range of sequence-related variables (e.g., 5&#x02019; or 3&#x02019; terminal nucleotides, %GC of the four 5&#x02019; or 3&#x02019;end nucleotides, overall %GC, dG [free energy], dH [enthalpy], dS [entropy] and Tm) did not reveal strong associations, suggesting that the mechanistic basis of the bias may be complex.</p><p id="P28">Even using the best-performing 4N protocols, there is still considerable sequence-related bias, which precludes the use of read counts alone for accurate quantification of different small RNAs within a given sample. However, despite the observed biases, we found that small RNA-seq is consistently accurate for relative quantification of a given miRNA between samples, as long as the same library preparation protocol is used for the two samples being compared, which is in agreement with previous observations for mRNA sequencing<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. In this sense, all of the evaluated protocols were able to distinguish samples with as little as 1.5-fold difference in relative abundance of most sequences examined, although the design of our ratiometric pools is such that differences smaller than 1.5-fold could not be assessed.</p><p id="P29">Reproducibility across laboratories is a crucial requirement for any experimental method used for research or clinical applications<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. We found that for common commercial protocols as well as for our in house 4N protocol, results are reproducible between labs with a CV &#x02264; 20% for most sequences. Moreover, when comparing relative quantification measurements obtained by small RNA-seq across labs, the results were highly concordant even when the centers were using different protocols.</p><p id="P30">We believe that the datasets generated in this study can also serve as a valuable resource for benchmarking computational tools designed to facilitate and improve upon RNA-seq analysis. This is important both for developing new software, and also for evaluating the suitability of using existing mRNA-seq algorithms for the analysis of small RNA-seq datasets. This could be particularly important for benchmarking software developed to account for various technical biases found in mRNA-seq data<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup>, as our data suggest that such biases may be different in small RNA-seq data.</p><p id="P31">We also hope that our data may facilitate development of computational approaches for normalization of datasets generated using different library preparation protocols. While normalization algorithms are generally not intended to account for cross-platform variation, our preliminary analysis suggests that small RNA-seq protocol-specific biases largely correlate across samples. This suggests that one may be able to account for the protocol-specific differences in sequencing bias individually for each sequence, raising the possibility of cross-protocol data normalization. We performed an initial exploration of this concept using a simple approach for calculating correction factors (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Results, Supplementary Table 9 and Supplementary Figures 19 and 20</xref>). Although this approach was able to make overall profiles from different protocols appear more similar to each other, its performance is not sufficient to be practically relevant yet. We propose that synthetic RNA reference data such as that generated here can provide a foundation for future development of more advanced computational approaches to enable accurate cross-protocol comparisons.</p><p id="P32">We also assessed the ability of library protocols to measure miRNA A-to-I editing. Our results demonstrate that low bias protocols (i.e. in house 4N_B) quantify editing more accurately than protocols using defined adapter sequences (i.e. TruSeq and NEBNext). It worth noting than accuracy of editing estimates can also be affected by low sequencing coverage. Indeed, some miRNAs had very low coverage by at least one of the protocols, which contributed to the inaccuracy and variation in editing estimates. However, this lack of coverage is a consequence of technical biases in small RNA-seq, since 4N_B libraries all had sufficient coverage of each sequence and because, at a minimum, all libraries had depth enough for ~6000x coverage of each sequence in the pool. Thus, protocols with a higher degree of sequencing bias also have a greater potential for inaccurate estimates of editing levels, because of lower read coverage for some miRNAs and/or differential preferences based on a single base difference. This is relevant to miRNA editing estimates reported in the literature, given that prior studies have commonly used the more biased protocols with fixed sequence adapters.<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Online Methods.

The adjusted CPM values were calculated using the method employed by the R package, EdgeR<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. This scales the user-supplied prior count (0.25; the default setting) to be proportional to the library size. The scaled prior count is calculated by multiplying the raw prior count (0.25) by the sample library size divided by the mean library size across all equimolar samples and then adding this value to the raw counts for each miRNA. Library sizes are adjusted by adding 2 x the scaled prior count value. Adjusted CPM values are finally calculated as (raw.count + adjusted.prior) <sup>*</sup> 10<sup>6</sup>/adjusted.library.size.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Determining overrepresented and under-represented sequences</title><p id="P50">Sequences in each equimolar pool replicate library were ranked by abundance, assigning the minimum rank value in case of ties. The 10 top and bottom-ranked sequences were determined by arranging counts in descending and ascending order, respectively. TruSeq, NEBNext, CleanTag and 4N libraries were each queried for sequences consistently found in the top or bottom 10, as defined by at least 75% agreement among the libraries of at least one method.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Dissecting the source of bias</title><p id="P51">The CPM obtained for each sequence of the equimolar pool was calculated using pseudo-counts, as in the equimolar pool analysis described above, except that the library sizes were calculated from all equimolar pool sequences prior to filtering for length and end modifications. Sequence length, 5&#x02019;and 3&#x02019; terminal bases, %GC of the four 5&#x02019;or 3&#x02019;end base, overall %GC, dG [free energy], dH [enthalpy], dS [entropy] and Tm [melting temperature] were calculated from the annotated sequence.

The ratio of SynthA:SynthB was calculated as the ratio of the mean CPM across technical replicates in SynthA/SynthB.</p><sec id="S22"><title>Ratiometric Pools: Differential Expression</title><p id="P53">Independent differential expression workflows were run for each lab and library prep method, following a standard two-group comparison between &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; ratiometric pools. Normalization, dispersion estimation and differential expression testing was performed using three different R packages: <italic>EdgeR</italic><sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>, <italic>DESeq2</italic><sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> and <italic>limma/voom</italic><sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>.

Default settings were used for <italic>DESeq2</italic>, and significance was calculated based on a Wald Test.

Read counts for mature miRNAs were taken from &#x0201c;readCounts_miRNAmature_sense.txt&#x0201d; files provided in the exceRpt pipeline output. The read count files and associated metadata for all samples were loaded and merged in R for further analysis. Multi-mapping-adjusted read counts are calculated as part of the exceRpt pipeline and were used for all comparisons. The total number of unique reads mapping to miRNAs was taken from &#x0201c;.stats&#x0201d; files provided in the exceRpt pipeline output.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Downsampling read counts</title><p id="P55">The R package Vegan, was used to simulate random downsampling of equimolar and plasma pool count matrices. The Vegan function, <italic>drarefy</italic>, was used to estimate the probability of detection for each sequence based on random simulations of downsampling to specified levels. For the plasma pools, downsampling was performed to four different levels (10<sup>4</sup>, 10<sup>4.5</sup>, 10<sup>5</sup> and 10<sup>5.5</sup>). Equimolar pools were downsampled to six different levels (10<sup>6.5</sup> down to 10<sup>4</sup> at half-log intervals). Libraries with read counts below the specified threshold were removed. A minimum probability of 0.9 was used as the threshold for detection.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Inter-protocol bias correction factors: estimation</title><p id="P56">Equimolar pool samples were processed through the exceRpt pipeline using the same input parameters as the plasma pool libraries, in order to obtain multi-mapping, scaled read counts for mature miRNAs that were directly comparable to the plasma pool counts. Differential expression analyses were performed using the mature miRNA read counts for the equimolar pool samples, and scaling factors were calculated for each miRNA, and were taken from the resulting log2 fold-change estimates. Key assumptions used in these calculations were: that the median mapped read level calculated for a given protocol should match the median for the 4N results given the same RNA input; that the comparisons of the results from a given protocol and the 4N protocol are performed on data processed in the same way that biological samples are processed (i.e., using the exceRpt pipeline and its mapped read outputs). For details on <italic>limma</italic> and <italic>voom</italic> functionality and the parameters used, see the documentation for the <italic>limma</italic> package.</p><p id="P57">To summarize: correction factors were calculated for each pair of library preparation methods using the following workflow:
<list list-type="order" id="L1"><list-item><p id="P58">Filter out miRNAs with 0 counts in any library: For the subset of samples being tested, scaling factors are only calculated for miRNAs having at least one count in every sample of the two methods being tested.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P59">Prepare miRNA count matrices for linear modeling: Use the R package, <italic>voom</italic>, to calculate precision weight estimates and normalize data to allow count data to be analyzed appropriately using the limma package.

For each pairwise comparison of library preparation methods, equimolar pool counts matrices were extracted and only miRNAs with &#x02265; 1 read count in all samples of both methods were kept for analysis. After filtering, <italic>voom</italic> was used to normalize the count data and calculate precision weight estimates that allow count data to be appropriately tested with the linear modeling schema used in the <italic>limma</italic> package. <italic>Voom</italic> was run with the default parameters, except that read counts were additionally normalized between arrays using the &#x0201c;scale&#x0201d; method, which adjusts read counts such that the median miRNA expression value is the same in all labs. The <italic>voom</italic>-transformed data was supplied to the <italic>limma</italic> lmFit function, along with a design matrix indicating the coefficients to be estimated. Initially, coefficients were estimated for each lab+library prep method in order to model batch/lab-specific effects. The main effect of the library prep method was then calculated as the average effect of method 1 - method 2. A <italic>contrasts</italic> matrix was generated and supplied, with the fitted model, to the contrasts.fit function, followed by an empirical Bayes function to estimate the resulting statistics for each miRNA. Log<sub>2</sub> fold-change estimates, along with 95% CI were obtained from these estimates.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Inter-protocol bias correction factors: applying corrections</title><p id="P63">The equimolar pool-derived, inter-protocol bias correction factors were applied to the corresponding plasma pool samples for testing. To apply the correction factors, count matrices for the subset of plasma pool libraries being compared were selected and were then pre-filtered and normalized in the same way as the equimolar pools in generating the correction factors, described above. MiRNAs were filtered to include only those with a) a correction factor estimated from the equimolar pool and b) at least 5 counts in every library in the subset of methods being compared. Correction factors were applied to the appropriate samples. For example, if correction factors were calculated as the log<sub>2</sub> fold-change between TruSeq and 4N samples (TruSeq - 4N), then the correction factors would be applied to the log<sub>2</sub>-transformed TruSeq plasma pool samples by subtracting the correction factor. For the heatmaps and density plots, corrected values were added to the original count matrix of untransformed values, and unless specifically noted in the text, normalized using quantile normalization.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>miRNA editing analysis</title><p id="P64">Editing libraries were trimmed of 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; adapters using cutadapt (version 1.9.1). Trimmed reads &#x02265; 16 nt were aligned to editing pool sequences using bowtie2 (version 2.3.2) in local alignment mode. The first (5&#x02019;) 4 nt were removed from 4N library reads during the alignment stage by adding the optional parameter &#x0201c;&#x02013;trim5p 4&#x0201d;. Read counts were calculated from alignments filtered to have a minimum MAPQ of 20 and 0 mismatches to the reference sequence within the locally-aligned region.

study design</title><p>(<bold>Top</bold>) The four primary RNA pools used as common reference samples in the study are shown. Equimolar and ratiometric pools were prepared using chemically-synthesized RNA oligonucleotides to establish &#x0201c;ground-truth&#x0201d; knowledge of absolute and relative abundances, respectively. The equimolar pool consisted of 1,152 synthetic RNAs (15-90 nt) mixed at equal concentration. Downstream analyses focused on the subset of 977 RNAs 16-25 nt in length and with 5&#x02019;-phosphate modifications. The two ratiometric pools, A and B, consisted of 334 synthetic RNAs, in which subsets of RNAs were varied in relative abundance between the two pools. The RNAs were divided into 15 ratiometric subgroups. The subset of 290 RNAs, 16-25 nt in length, was used for downstream analyses, and the number of RNAs in each ratiometric subgroup is indicated. The plasma RNA pool comprised RNA from 11 healthy males that was centrally isolated and distributed to the participating labs. <bold>(Middle)</bold> Nine different library preparation protocols were tested. Three commercially available kits with &#x0201c;invariant&#x0201d; adapters and six 4N Random-End protocols were tested. (<bold>Bottom</bold>) Common reference RNA pools were distributed to 9 participating labs for sequencing in quadruplicate, using a standardized common protocol (TruSeq) and at least one additional method of their choice. The breakdown of the resulting libraries is depicted in the colored grid, with the Lab IDs indicated by columns, and the replicates and pools shown in rows. Solid grey blocks indicate libraries that were not attempted. Grey blocks with a diagonal red line indicate samples where library preparation and sequencing was attempted but was unsuccessful. Sequencing was performed by each lab independently.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms964614f1"/></fig><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Equimolar pool sequencing results across multiple labs and protocols</title><p><bold>(a)</bold> The heatmap shows expression levels for each synthetic RNA sequence (rows) across all replicate equimolar pool libraries (columns). Expression levels represent log<sub>2</sub>-scaled counts-per-million (CPM) calculated for 977 equimolar pool sequences which are 16-25 nt in length and 5&#x02019;-phosphorylated. Hierarchical clustering for rows and columns represents complete linkage clustering on Euclidean distances (the default setting for the R package, pheatmap, used for plotting).

The width of the violins is proportional to the density of data points at each position. The horizontal lines within each violin represent the 25, 50 and 75<sup>th</sup> percentiles. The dashed horizontal line shows the expected CPM for each sequence in the equimolar pool (10<sup>6</sup>/977 miRNAs = 1023.5 CPM).

<bold>(b)</bold> Heatmaps show the pairwise, squared Spearman rank correlation coefficients from sequencing the SynthA and SynthB pools. Pairwise correlation coefficients were calculated based on the mean CPM across technical replicates for SynthA samples (left), SynthB samples (middle) and the ratio of SynthA : SynthB (right). The mean CPM value for each ratiometric pool sequence was calculated from n=4 technical replicate libraries per lab, library preparation method and pool. Mean CPM values for n=290 ratiometric pool RNAs were used for calculating each pairwise correlation coefficient. Hierarchical clustering for rows and columns is the same for all heatmaps, and is based on the average pairwise Euclidean distances calculated from the SynthA CPM and SynthB CPM correlation matrices. Column labels indicate the lab ID and library prep method; row labels indicate only lab ID, but are presented in the same order (top to bottom) as columns (left to right).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms964614f3"/></fig><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Reproducibility of small RNA-seq within- and between-labs</title><p><bold>(a)</bold> Violin plots summarize the technical reproducibility of quantification for all equimolar pool sequences, as calculated from each lab and library preparation method.

Each box summarizes number of miRNAs detected by each lab for the indicated protocol. The probability of each miRNA being detected was estimated for every sample randomly downsampled to 10<sup>4</sup>, 10<sup>4.5</sup>, 10<sup>5</sup>, or 10<sup>5.5</sup> total read counts. A miRNA was only counted as detected if the probability of detection was at least 90%. Libraries with total counts less than the indicated sample size were excluded.
