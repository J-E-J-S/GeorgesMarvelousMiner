Robust methods for the generation of mutant and recombinant viruses are crucial for these diverse applications. Here we describe a simple plasmid-based method that permits highly efficient modification of the adenoviral genome and rapid production of high-titer virus stocks. The 36-kilobase genome of adenovirus serotype 5 was divided into seven tractable blocks that could be individually modified in a single step and reassembled <italic>in vitro</italic>. Because the system is composed of compact modules, modifications at different loci can be readily recombined. Viral assemblies were delivered to packaging cells by electroporation, a strategy that consistently resulted in the <italic>de novo</italic> production of 10<sup>8</sup> infectious units in 3&#x02013;5 days. In principle, a similar strategy could be applied to any other adenovirus serotype or to other double-strand DNA viruses.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R25CA171973</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0878-1553</contrib-id><name><surname>Bunz</surname><given-names>Fred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI137726</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0878-1553</contrib-id><name><surname>Bunz</surname><given-names>Fred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012298</institution-id><institution>Allegheny Health Network</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0878-1553</contrib-id><name><surname>Bunz</surname><given-names>Fred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA006973</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases grant R21AI137726 (FB), the National Cancer Institute grants R25CA171973 and P30CA006973 (FB) and the Allegheny Health Network (FB).

These studies also revealed unique attributes that have made adenoviruses suitable for a wide range of translational, clinical and industrial applications. Adenoviruses were among the first human viruses to be harnessed for transgene delivery [<xref rid="pone.0199563.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and have since become indispensable tools for the development of vaccines and novel therapies. The development of oncolytic adenovirus mutants that can exploit the innate immune deficiencies of tumor cells highlights the potential of customized adenoviruses as biological drugs [<xref rid="pone.0199563.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The adenoviridae comprise a large and relatively diverse family of medium sized, non-enveloped, doubled-stranded DNA viruses, which collectively infect numerous hosts and tissues [<xref rid="pone.0199563.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. More than 50 distinct serotypes have been identified in humans. In immunocompetent individuals adenoviral infections tend to be self-limiting and are often subclinical. Exposure is prevalent throughout the human population, and most adults have acquired immunity to multiple adenovirus serotypes. Among the most frequently studied and heavily exploited of the human adenoviruses is serotype 5 (Ad5). The 35,938 bp genome of Ad5 encodes 36 proteins.</p><p>Ad5 and related serotypes can be reconfigured to deliver large transgenes with high efficiency. Once unpackaged inside the cell, the adenoviral genome is maintained transiently as an episome, and does not integrate into the genome of the host. Recombinant adenoviruses designed to deliver transgenes commonly lack some of the mechanisms that wild-type adenoviruses employ to circumvent host immunity and are most often replication-incompetent. Together, these attributes make recombinant adenoviruses a popular vector for transgene delivery.</p><p>Traditionally, the production of adenoviral vectors was a laborious process involving homologous integration of mutant sequences or transgenes in human packaging cells followed by plaque purification and screening for clonal recombinants. A major advance was the development of cloned viral DNAs that could be propagated in bacteria or yeast and then transferred to specialized human cells for packaging [<xref rid="pone.0199563.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199563.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Subsequently, an <italic>in vivo</italic> approach known as recombineering permitted desired genetic elements to be seamlessly incorporated into viral genomes via homologous recombination in bacteria. A number of recombineering systems have been introduced that employ recombogenic bacterial strains and specialized features such as lambda phage-mediated gene transfer and strategies for vector excision [<xref rid="pone.0199563.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199563.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Such systems have facilitated the development of high-capacity adenoviral vectors (so-called &#x0201c;gutless&#x0201d; vectors), which typically employ a shuttling system for large transgenes and a helper virus that provides essential viral proteins in <italic>trans</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0199563.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199563.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Recently, CRISPR-Cas9 has been used to stimulate site-specific recombination directly in packaging cells [<xref rid="pone.0199563.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The genomic modifications enabled by these increasingly powerful methods of recombineering have been extensively used to modify viral characteristics and improve our understanding of viral gene function [<xref rid="pone.0199563.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199563.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Enzymatic methods have also been employed for viral genome assembly. A distinct advantage of <italic>in vitro</italic> assembly is that synthetic DNAs can be directly incorporated into the viral genome. Infectious adenoviruses have been rescued from genomes that were assembled <italic>in vitro</italic> from multiple cloned segments, initially derived by high-fidelity PCR [<xref rid="pone.0199563.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A synthetic approach is particularly well-suited for the PCR amplification and reassembly of viruses isolated from clinical samples. Mutations or transgenes can be simultaneously introduced into multiple sites across a viral genome, and DNA sequencing can be easily performed on subcloned viral segments prior to their assembly.</p><p>Here, we describe a synthetic system for viral genome assembly and packaging that we call Adenobuilder. This system permits the rapid generation of high-titer Ad5 stocks from ordinary high-copy plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199563.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The partitioning of the Ad5 genome into seven modular &#x0201c;blocks&#x0201d; allows individual viral genes to be easily manipulated in isolation and then recombined with other mutations or transgenes. When delivered to complementary packaging cells by electroporation, the enzymatically assembled genomes were packaged at high efficiency. Unlike recombineering systems, the Adenobuilder method does not require specialized bacterial strains or the propagation of low copy vectors such as bacterial artificial chromosomes.</p><fig id="pone.0199563.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0199563.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Overview of the Adenobuilder system.</title><p>Segments of the Ad5 genome were individually amplified and cloned into high-copy plasmids. Each of the five central &#x0201c;building blocks&#x0201d; contains unique sequences at either end (represented by distinct colors) that create a 15&#x02013;20 bp overlap with the respective neighboring block. Each block is flanked by recognition sites for the restriction enzyme BstBI. Following digestion, the unpurified plasmid fragments are directly added to an isothermal assembly reaction and then delivered to packaging cells via electroporation. This system thus facilitates the generation of infectious adenovirus particles from plasmids in three steps that can be carried out in under two hours.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0199563.g001"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ad5 virus, cell lines, and antibodies</title><p>Ad5 reference virus (catalog VR-1516) and HEK293 cells (catalog CRL-1573) were obtained directly from the American Type Tissue Collection.

Here, we demonstrate how slight refinements of this technique can greatly simplify the creation of adenoviral mutants and the subsequent modular assembly and packaging of viral genomes.</p><p>In the design of the Adenobuilder system, we chose to partition the adenoviral genome into blocks that each contain a defined transcription unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199563.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The sizes of the blocks ranged from 3.5 to 7.1 kb, and thus were small enough to be robustly amplified by high-fidelity PCR and stably cloned into plasmids that could be propagated at high copy number. The compiled sequence of the seven cloned blocks differed from the Ad5 reference sequence (NCBI AC_000008.1) at 19 positions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199563.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199563.s005">S5</xref> Tables).

However, this presumed requirement for efficiency comes at the price of working with large DNA blocks that are significantly more difficult to modify and stably propagate.</p><p>Each cloned block was flanked with the recognition sequence for the restriction enzyme BstBI, which is not present in the Ad5 reference genome. This enzyme was originally derived from the thermophile <italic>Bacillus stearothermophilus</italic> and is optimally active at elevated temperatures. This property facilitates a simple isothermal assembly process. Following BstBI digestion, assembly was performed by a combination of enzymes that includes a mesophilic 5&#x02019;-3&#x02019; exonuclease, a high-fidelity thermophilic DNA polymerase with 3&#x02019;-5&#x02019; exonuclease activity and a thermophilic DNA ligase. Similar to the approach first devised by Gibson [<xref rid="pone.0199563.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], these enzymes coordinately create complementary single-stranded regions at overlapping termini, remove small mismatches at the ends once the strands anneal, fill in the gaps and ligate the ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199563.g003">Fig 3</xref>). These reactions are performed at 50&#x000b0;C. Because the 5&#x02019;-3&#x02019; exonuclease is labile at the reaction temperature, the generation of single stranded regions is transient. The remaining enzymes, including BstBI, remain active and promote assembly to completion.</p><fig id="pone.0199563.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0199563.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Seamless ligation of adjacent genomic blocks.</title><p>The free ends created by BstBI are initially processed by the heat-labile T5 exonuclease, creating an extended 3&#x02019; overhang at each end.

The compatible ends of Blocks 1 and 2 are shown; the other junctions are simultaneously processed in the same manner.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0199563.g003"/></fig><p>We first generated infectious virus from unmodified blocks that were derived directly from the wild type reference Ad5 genome. As described in Materials and methods, the seven plasmids were combined in a single BstBI digestion reaction and incubated at 50&#x000b0;C. All plasmids appeared to be completely cut after 30 min, and each excised block could be readily visualized on an agarose gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199563.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The assembly reaction generated a ladder of high molecular weight DNAs, with the uppermost band running at the approximate size of the full-length Ad5 genome. The intermediate bands between the unit blocks and the full length genome presumably reflected partial assemblies. Pairwise assembly of Blocks 1&#x02013;2, 2&#x02013;3, 4&#x02013;5, and 6&#x02013;7 would account for the prominent band running at about 10 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199563.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Overall, the products of the assembly reaction were biased in favor of partially assembled DNAs. However, because the input DNA blocks are present at picomolar levels, significant amounts of full length DNA could be generated. Adenoviruses only package genomes within a limited size range. Presumably any partial assembly would be lacking critical functional elements required for productive infection and replication.</p><fig id="pone.0199563.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0199563.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Reassembly and packaging of infectious Ad5.</title><p><bold>A.</bold> Equimolar amounts of each of the seven Adenobuilder plasmids were digested with BstBI and then incubated for an additional 60 min with (+) and without (-) the assembly enzyme mix.

Between 4&#x02013;7 days post infection, many cells became detached and the medium appeared acidic, observations that are consistent with active virus production. Analysis of these primary cultures indicated that viruses were generated in amounts ranging between 10<sup>6</sup>&#x02212;10<sup>7</sup> IU. A 200 &#x003bc;l aliquot of a primary Ad5 lysate, about 5% of the total lysate obtained, was applied to a single flask containing 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> HEK293 cells. These cells were harvested after 72 h.

To confirm that the blocks had assembled as expected, we compared viral genomic DNAs from the original Ad5 reference stock (ATCC) and the amplified stock of assembled virus by restriction digest. Incubation with EcoRV and HindIII generated all of the expected bands in both samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199563.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). (A 75 bp band expected from the HindIII digest could not be resolved on this type of gel.) Individual viral particles of the expected size could be detected in the primary lysate by EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199563.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). For various assemblies, we found that a stock with a useable titer could be reliably generated within a week of electroporation.</p><p>The relatively small size of the blocks makes them easy to modify. To demonstrate a straightforward approach to mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199563.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), we incorporated several functional base changes into the E1B and E4 loci, respectively located on Blocks1 and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199563.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). The Gibson method is often used to assemble plasmids from multiple overlapping fragments, but can also be employed to circularize plasmids generated by PCR. We exploited this attribute, using overlapping oligonucleotides to incorporate mutations into derivative plasmids. Each oligonucleotide pair was designed with altered bases in an overlapping region such that high-fidelity PCR amplification from a plasmid template resulted in a linear DNA with a mutation of interest reproduced at both ends. The linear DNAs were then circularized in an isothermal reaction that was similar to that used for multi-block genome assembly. This method proved to be remarkably efficient. In our hands, nearly 100% of the plasmid subclones harbored the desired alteration.</p><fig id="pone.0199563.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0199563.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Two-step derivation of mutations in E1B and E4.</title><p><bold>A.</bold> The mutant constructs were first amplified with two partially overlapping primers designed to incorporate the desired alteration (shown in green), using the corresponding wild type block as a template.

In the second step, the PCR-derived plasmid was circularized in an assembly reaction, which merged and sealed the overlapping ends. <bold>B.</bold> Oligonucleotide pairs that were used to generate the mutants are illustrated. The mutant block 1-derived constructs were E1B19K-null, E1B55K-null or modified to express an endogenous E1B55K protein with a c-terminal FLAG epitope. Similarly, the E4ORF3 open reading frame was disrupted by a mutation at the initiation codon or the introduction of a c-terminal FLAG tag. The targeted codons are boxed, single base mutations are shown in red. At positions where the initiation codon of the target protein overlapped with a codon for a different protein, base substitutions were selected so that the mutation would be silent with respect to the second open reading frame. <bold>C.</bold> hTERT-RPE1 cells were infected with the synthetic Ad5 virus and the E1B mutant viruses generated in this study. Cells were lysed 16 h post-infection, and assessed by immunoblot with antibodies against p53 and the FLAG epitope, as indicated. <bold>D.</bold> hTERT-RPE1 cells were uninfected (no virus) or infected with wild type Ad5 and the E4 mutants. For all viruses, the MOI was 100. GAPDH was probed as a loading control.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0199563.g005"/></fig><p>The E1 locus encodes several oncogenic proteins that are crucial for bypassing the innate immune responses of the infected host cell. The E1B55K protein, in cooperation with E4ORF6, recruits several host proteins to form an active ubiquitin ligase complex that binds and degrades p53 protein [<xref rid="pone.0199563.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Adenoviruses with mutant E1B55K fail to suppress the activation of p53, and therefore cause a marked increase in p53 abundance. Following assembly, packaging and a single round of amplification, the E1B-mutant viruses were used to infect hTERT-RPE1, an immortalized human cell line derived from retinal epithelia. These cells are not cancer-derived, and express functional p53 [<xref rid="pone.0199563.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Infection with the synthetically-derived mutant E1B viruses demonstrated the known requirement for the E1B55K protein, but not the E1B19K protein, for the inhibition of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199563.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Interestingly, the endogenous c-terminal FLAG tag did not significantly impair the ability of the E1B55K to participate in the degradation of p53.</p><p>Like E1, the early region E4 is critical for inactivation of the p53 pathway in infected cells. One of the small proteins expressed from the E4 locus, E4ORF3 forms a nuclear scaffold that causes the epigenetic silencing of p53 target genes [<xref rid="pone.0199563.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The generation of mutations within E4 presents a distinct challenge, as HEK293 cells do not normally complement losses of function within this region. In order to derive E4ORF3-mutant viruses, we first attempted to deliver assembled viral genomes directly into the E4-complementing cell line W162 [<xref rid="pone.0199563.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These experiments did not yield infectious virus. Next, we mixed the E4-mutant assemblies with 1 &#x003bc;g of the undigested pAd5-B7 plasmid, which harbors the wild type E4 region, just prior to electroporation of HEK293. This <italic>trans</italic>-complementation approach resulted in the production of infectious virus with alterations in E4. We successfully produced a mutant that was null for E4ORF3 as well as a virus that expressed a FLAG-tagged E4ORF3 protein from its endogenous position in E4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199563.s008">S2 Fig</xref>). The E4ORF3-FLAG protein could be readily detected following infection of hTERT-RPE1, albeit at lower levels than the wild type, untagged E4ORF3 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199563.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Once packaged in HEK293, these viruses could be robustly amplified in W162 cells, allowing the production of high-titer stocks. While most of the lysates contained viruses that exclusively harbored the desired E4 mutations, wild type sequences were sporadically detected when this entire assembly-packaging process was repeated numerous times, indicating that mutant assemblies recombined with the input wild type plasmid at a detectable frequency.</p><p>Because adenoviral vectors are most frequently employed for transgene delivery, we modified the wild type Adenobuilder blocks so that they could accommodate exogenous DNA cassettes of various sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199563.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Expression cassettes up to 3 kb can be directly inserted pAd5-B1&#x00394;E1-MCS, which contains a convenient polylinker that replaces a similarly-sized region in E1. The potential delivery capacity of Adenobuilder-derived vectors was further increased by deleting endogenous loci in blocks E3 and E4. Incorporating pAd5-B6&#x00394;E3 and pAd5-B7&#x00394;E4 into a synthetic assembly permits the packaging of synthetic adenoviruses that harbor transgenic elements up to 8.5 kb in size, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199563.g006">Fig 6B</xref>. The only limitation other than size would be the requirement that inserted cassettes be designed so as not to contain the recognition site for BstBI.</p><fig id="pone.0199563.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0199563.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Modifications to blocks 1, 6 and 7 facilitate the incorporation of large transgenic elements into recombinant Ad5 vectors.</title><p><bold>A</bold>, DNA cassettes up to 3 kb in size can be directly cloned into a polylinker in the modified block pAd5-B1&#x00394;E1-MCS.

Used together, these three modified blocks thus allow the customized assembly of recombinant viruses capable of delivering transgenic elements up to 8.5 kb in size.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0199563.g006"/></fig><p>While numerous techniques for the development of customized adenoviruses are currently available, the Adenobuilder method has several advantages. Because the adenoviral genome is partitioned into 7 compact, functionally-defined modules, each individual module is small enough to be stably propagated on a conventional, high-copy plasmid. Such plasmids are easily prepared, stored and modified by procedures that are standardized and highly accessible. We found that virus production following synthetic genome delivery was highly robust, which allowed us to minimize the iterative rounds of amplification that are commonly needed to produce stocks of useable titer.</p><p>In these studies we introduced various mutations, epitope tags and polylinker elements into the blocks corresponding to E1, E3 and E4. The trans-complementation approach successfully used to generate E4 mutants could, in principle, be applied to the creation of mutations in other Ad5 segments. Such mutants were not generated in this course of the present study. The region between E1 and E4 encompasses more than one half of the viral genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199563.g001">Fig 1</xref>) and harbors many genes and promoter elements that are essential for viral propagation. Despite decades of intense investigation, the functions of numerous adenovirus genes and proteins remain poorly understood.
