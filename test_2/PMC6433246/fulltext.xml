The current rate of increase in global use of polyethylene and plastic products is approximately 12% per annum, and this continues to rise [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. For instance, consumer demand drove global production to approximately 140 million tons of synthetic polymers, which increased by 1.74-fold over the past 15 years to about 243 million tons [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As a result, the amount of global plastic wastes have tremendously increased, posing various degrees of threat to the environment, ecosystems, economies and all life forms. Plastic contamination of compost, an organic soil amendment used in agriculture to enhance soil health and productivity, may have a wide range of negative impacts on the environment and agro-ecological systems. These concerns have been expressed by the public including environmental advocates, growers and researchers [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. For instance, plastics in compost can cause major environmental threats due to their inability to breakdown or their low rate of breakdown which thereby, may lead to environmental pollution, blockage of water ways and death of marine and fresh water flora and fauna [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Plastics can negatively affect the soil ecosystem by releasing toxic substances and inhibiting soil dwelling [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, plastic-associated toxic compounds can potentially enter the food chain and affect human health [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Another possibility is adverse effects of plastic contamination on seed germination, root penetration, nutrient and water flow, and root uptake of water and nutrients from soil [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although another study suggested no effect of plastic contamination on seed germination [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Additionally, essential resources such as water and soil nutrients are not accessible to plants due to impermeability of these pieces of plastics.</p><p>Composting is an environmentally friendly and organic method of waste management. Historically, composting has been used to recycle agricultural wastes and return the composted organic matter into the soil to maintain soil fertility and crop productivity with minimum application of synthetic chemical fertilizers [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. During composting, the diversity and structure of microbial communities, as well as chemical and physical properties of the composting substrates change dramatically in the course of several weeks [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>One of the main problems facing the compost industry is contamination from plastic wastes. In some cases, visible plastic wastes in compost can reach up to 1.2 g per kg of compost [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214376.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is an example of thermo-plastic comprised of long chain unlinked polymer molecules and used to make thin, flexible plastics like wrapping films, grocery bags, sandwich bags and a variety of soft packaging materials. Due to the inert nature of plastics such as LDPE, their decomposition requires a prolonged period (up to 1000 years) that goes far beyond the normal period for the various biotic and abiotic steps in the composting process, which can last from several week to several month depending on the type of composting method. Biotic plastic degradation is a natural process by which microorganisms breakdown plastics into smaller units in order to use the carbon sources for energy and growth [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214376.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Studies on biodegradation of several types of plastics in soils revealed that some fungi and bacteria species are capable of degrading plastics into carbon and energy for cellular metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214376.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, little is known about the ecology of microbial plastic degradation and the effect of plastic contamination on compost microbiome.</p><p>In this study we employ next-generation amplicon sequencing to better understand the ecological effect of plastic contamination of compost by assessing LDPE plastic-influenced species sorting effect on bacterial and fungal communities in mature compost piles at the age range of 2 to 10 years. We analyze diversity and structure of microbial communities associated with both mature bulk compost and compost associated with partially degraded plastic from each of four major compost facilities across Nova Scotia (Canada). We also applied microbial co-occurrence analysis to evaluate the effect of plastic on the interaction within microbial communities and to identify niche specific modules, which could provide the insight on the function of the microbiome in plastic-influenced environments. We hypothesized that plastic environments may cause a shift in microbial cooperation improving microbiome adaptation and efficiency of carbon utilization in plastic-influenced environments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study was carried out on private land and the owners of the land gave permission to conduct the study on these sites, and therefore no specific permissions were required for these locations/activities</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Sample collection and processing</title><p>Samples of compost and plastics were collected in August and September of 2016 from four different composting facilities in Nova Scotia, Canada (<xref rid="pone.0214376.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

In addition, 500 g of bulk compost within 10-cm radius around the sampled plastics were collected at each location using a sterile hand auger. The plastic and compost samples were kept in sterile plastic bags and immediately placed in a cooling box with icepacks before transporting them to the laboratory.

The structure of bacterial communities changes as the composting process progresses with the dominance of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> in the early stages and <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> in the late stages [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214376.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214376.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our study revealed that <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> remained the dominant phylum across the compost facilities. <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> and <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> were also among most of the dominant microbial taxa. These bacterial taxa were previously reported to be dominant at the latter stages in the composting process [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Similar to our results, <italic>Ascomycota</italic> was the largest fungi phylum that has been reported in compost [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214376.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>All four composting facilities studied use the windrow composting method, which produces aerobic compost. Periodic turning of the compost material (feedstock) during the composting process aerate the mass and encourage microbial activities leading to natural degradation of the organic materials to form a stable humic substance [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Compost recipes and feedstock is an important ingredient in the compost processing [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Feedstock is the main source of carbon and nitrogen for microorganism&#x02019;s energy and growth and it varies from one compost facility to another. For example, carbon sources include straw, paper, woodchips and tree bark, while nitrogen sources include manure, sewage and municipal solid waste. <italic>Ascomycota</italic> and <italic>Basidiomycota</italic> are considered to be very important decomposers of hays, straws and wood in the forest floors and during composting processes [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214376.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. <italic>Agaricomycetes</italic> (<italic>Basidiomycota</italic>) and <italic>Sordariomycete</italic> (<italic>Ascomycota</italic>) were associated with hardwood degradation in compost. They have the potential to degrade lignin and cellulose in wood and other plant parts during natural decomposition [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214376.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214376.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. All four compost facilities in this study used hay, straw or wood as a bulking material. This can explain why <italic>Agaricomycetes</italic> and <italic>Sordariomycetes</italic> were the dominant fungal classes in our study.</p><p>Variation in sample groupings as explained by Bray-Curtis beta-diversity showed a significant variation in community structure between compost facilities. This variation can be explained by several factors including compost chemical parameters, feedstock and age of pile. Compost chemical parameters differed between facilities and the significant correlation between some of these parameters and bacterial and fungal alpha- and beta-diversity was detected. In soils, the overall diversity, richness and evenness of bacterial community increased as the soil habitat matured [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Similar tendency was detected in our study, although the range of time was different in our study. The compost from Fundy compost facility was the oldest at about 10 years old and was associated with the highest alpha-diversity of bacterial community. The use of wood chips in Fundy compost facility as one of the major feedstock or bulking material can be one of the main reasons why the higher relative abandons of <italic>Agaricomycetes</italic> was observed in their compost compared with those from the other three facilities. However, the effect of age of the pile on the abundance of <italic>Agaricomycetes</italic> should not be disregarded.</p><p>We hypothesized that after prolonged storage of LDPE in compost pile i.e. between 2&#x02013;10 years, the plastic could undergo some photo- and thermo-degradation and hydrolysis [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214376.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], which may lead to the release of low molecular weight compounds. These compounds could be used as a carbon and nitrogen source by endogenous microorganisms in compost. It had been demonstrated that thermal and/or photolytic treatment promotes LDPE biodegradation [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Consequently, our hypothesis was that despite the inert nature of the plastics, microbial communities associated with partially degraded plastic would be enriched with microbial taxa either capable to utilize carbon released during abiotic plastic degradation or degrade and use the plastic for growth. For example, it was shown that after 12 weeks of composting, fungal population on the surface of polyurethanes was different from the surrounding compost community, suggesting enrichment and selection [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>However, the results of the present study showed that there was no significant direct effect of LDPE plastic on the structure of microbial community in compost. Based on the analysis of strength and statistical significance of sample groupings, the structure of PA microbiota did not differ from microbiota from bulk compost. We also did not detect any differences in alpha-diversity and in relative abundances of microbial taxa between PA and bulk compost communities.</p><p>On the other hand, based on overall structure of co-occurrence networks, the presence of plastics affected the interaction pattern within microbial communities. We found a large number of niche-specific microbial taxa producing both cooperative and competitive association only in bulk or PA compost. Our data also indicated an increase in the importance of cooperative interactions in plastic-influenced environment compared with bulk compost. Additionally, a decrease in the complexity of the PA compost network was detected, which might be also linked to the community adaptation to plastic environment.</p><p>Schlatter <italic>et al</italic>. analyzed the effect of glyphosate treatment on microbial interactions in soils and showed that, despite the substantial shifts in the specific fungal interactions, the overall structure of the networks exhibited resilience to herbicide application [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Similarly, our data suggested a stability of overall network structure across bulk and PA compost. However, cooperation between <italic>Firmicutes Bacillaceae</italic> and <italic>Thermoactinomycetaceae</italic> was detected only in PA compost. These microorganisms were among dominant bacterial families shown to be affected by compost recipe and composting method [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Taking into consideration that previous studies on biodegradation of plastics in different environments identified <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. as potential microorganisms involved in this process [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], our data suggest that the formation of positive associations among <italic>Firmicutes</italic> might not be only an adaptation response to plastic environment but also a mechanism for improvement of efficiency of plastic degradation by these bacteria.</p><p>In conclusion, our study has shown a minor effect of LDPE on diversity and structure of compost microbiome, suggesting that the presence of this type of plastics is not harmful for compost ecosystem. Our data also indicate that in some situations the analysis of network interactions might provide a better resolution for elucidation of the effects of environmental factors on microbial communities compared with the direct analysis of the communities&#x02019; diversity and structure. Likewise, it was shown that, in contrast to subtle effects of glyphosate on the structure of fungal communities, the co-occurrence network structure was robust to the herbicide application [<xref rid="pone.0214376.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This is especially true in the situations when the minor environmental variations, like LDPE vicinity, can cause subtle impact on community structure but require a substantial shift in cooperation between community members for adaptation and probably for more efficient carbon utilization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0214376.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Microbial taxa identified in the study.</title><p>A, Bacteria, 16S rRNA gene; B, fungi, ITS.</p><p>(PPTX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0214376.s001.pptx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0214376.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCA) of microbial communities based on bacterial 16S (A,C) and fungal ITS (B,D) community Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix.</title><p>Each point is a different sample and the colors indicate the different sampling niches.
