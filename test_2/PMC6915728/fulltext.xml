Although there is a considerable diversity in their amino acid content, length and structure, AMPs are typically positively charged and amphipathic molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. These properties allow them to adsorb onto the bacterial cell surface and penetrate through the membrane to exert their diverse antibacterial actions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. As AMPs have a broad spectrum of activity, considerable efforts have been allocated to the research and development of novel anti-infective compounds originating from AMPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, the clinical development of AMP therapies, has also raised concerns that these approaches may drive bacterial evolution of resistance to human host-defense peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. As well, therapeutic AMPs are required to be active against pathogenic bacteria, many of which have already evolved resistance against human host AMPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Therefore, ideally, resistance mechanisms against therapeutic and host AMPs should not overlap.</p><p id="Par4">Accumulating evidence suggests that AMPs differ considerably in their modes of action, which may influence the specific microbial resistance mechanisms against them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. First, there are substantial differences in the electrostatic interactions and transport processes that lead to the cellular uptake of AMPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Second, the cellular targets of AMPs are also diverse in nature. For instance, apart from their membrane-disruptive activities, AMPs inhibit intracellular processes such as bacterial DNA and RNA synthesis, translation, cell wall synthesis, and diverse metabolic pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. However, the extent to which the genetic determinants of resistance differ across AMPs remains unclear, because most of our knowledge comes from case studies characterizing only a limited number of membrane-targeting AMPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> (for a list of previously reported resistance genes, see Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Therefore, there is an urgent need to comprehensively map the relationships between the modes of action of AMPs and the genetic determinants influencing bacterial susceptibility to them. Understanding these complex relationships would help to rationally choose AMPs for clinical development, which are dissimilar to human host peptides in terms of the underlying resistance mechanisms.</p><p id="Par5">Chemical-genetic profiling is a reverse genetic approach that quantifies the susceptibility of a genome-wide collection of mutant libraries to a set of chemical compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. By modulating gene dosage (i.e., either by depletion or overexpression), several studies demonstrated the effectiveness of this tool to map cellular targets and genetic determinants of resistance for antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Moreover, antibiotics with similar chemical-genetic interaction profiles, i.e., those with a large overlap between the gene sets influencing resistance to them, are likely to share cellular targets and mechanisms of action<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Consistent with this notion, chemical-genetic interaction profiles have been shown to carry information on cross-resistance, i.e., whether resistance evolution to an antibiotic would lead to decreased sensitivity to another antibiotic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Here, we employ a genome-wide chemical-genetic approach to explore the diversity of resistance determinants across AMPs in the model bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>). First, we generate a comprehensive chemical-genetic map by measuring how overexpressing each of the ~4400 <italic>E. coli</italic> genes influences the bacterium&#x02019;s susceptibility against 15 AMPs. The set of 15 AMPs are structurally and chemically diverse and include AMPs with well-characterized modes of action, clinical relevance, or crucial role in the human immune defense (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The resulting chemical-genetic interaction profiles cluster the AMPs according to their modes of action and reveal distinct and often antagonistic resistance determinants against membrane-targeting and intracellular-targeting AMPs. We confirm these results with a complementary chemical-genetic approach by testing the growth effect of a smaller set of 4 selected AMPs against an array of 279 partially depleted essential genes (i.e., hypomorphs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Finally, we analyze the cross-resistance patterns of <italic>E. coli</italic> lines that evolved resistance to AMPs in a recent laboratory evolution study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. This analysis confirms that intracellular-targeting AMPs are less likely to induce cross-resistance to membrane-targeting human AMPs than those that share the same broad modes of action.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>List and characteristics of AMPs used in this study.

We applied a sensitive competition assay by monitoring growth of a pooled plasmid library, overexpressing all the <italic>E. coli</italic> ORFs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), as we reported earlier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.

Following 12 generations of growth, the plasmid pool was isolated from each selection and the relative abundance of each plasmid was determined by a deep sequencing readout (see Methods). By comparing plasmid abundances in the presence and absence of each AMP, we calculated a chemical-genetic interaction score (fold-change value) for each gene and identified genes that significantly increase sensitivity (sensitivity-enhancing genes) or decrease sensitivity (resistance-enhancing genes) upon overexpression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2</xref>, see Methods).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Chemical-genetic profiling of AMPs.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic representation of the chemical-genetic pipeline.

First, we tested the reproducibility of the chemical-genetic interaction profiles by correlating the chemical-genetic interaction scores between replicate measurements. The overall correlation was comparable to what has been achieved with arrayed mutants on high-density agar plates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.63 from Pearson&#x02019;s correlation, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). This indicates that we measured the growth effects with sufficiently high confidence. Second, we picked 19 overexpression plasmids that showed diverse chemical-genetic interaction scores with multiple AMPs in our screen but did not influence the growth rate of <italic>E. coli</italic> in the absence of AMPs (see Methods) and performed minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) measurements on them. Although mutations that affect growth at sub-inhibitory drug dosage do not necessarily alter MIC, we detected a change in MIC in the expected direction for 83% of the tested chemical-genetic interactions (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). On average, the change in MIC was ~1.6-fold and ~0.7-fold for resistance-enhancing and sensitivity-enhancing gene overexpressions, respectively. Third, we collected examples from the literature where overexpression of an <italic>E. coli</italic> gene has been shown to influence sensitivity to a specific AMP. Despite differences in the used strains and protocols, 69% (9 out of 13) of the literature-curated interactions were captured by our screen (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Taken together, these analyses indicate that our workflow is suitable to measure chemical-genetic interactions between AMPs and gene overexpressions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Chemical-genetics groups AMPs with similar features</title><p id="Par9">We next explored how similarity in the chemical-genetic interaction profiles can inform on the functional and physicochemical similarities of AMPs.

This pattern could reflect subtle differences in the modes of action across the intracellular-targeting AMPs within cluster C3 as these peptides differ in their specific targets (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Similarly, lines adapted to intracellular-targeting AMPs from cluster C4 showed cross-resistance disproportionally more frequently to C4 AMPs than to intracellularly-targeting AMPs from cluster C3 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15b</xref>). Overall, these findings indicate that chemical-genetic interaction profiles capture genuine differences in resistance mechanisms between AMPs with the same broad mode of action. Finally, we note that AMPs in cluster C3 did not show cross-resistance to each other, confirming their diverse nature (i.e., both intracellular- and membrane-targeting).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Mode of action informs on cross-resistance spectra of AMP-evolved lines.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Cross-resistance interactions (i.e., defined as 2-fold increase in MIC) are significantly overrepresented between AMP pairs either from the group of exclusively membrane-targeting AMPs (TPII, CP1, PGLA, LL37, PEX) or from the group of exclusively intracellular-targeting AMPs (PR39 and BAC5) as compared to pairs of AMPs between the two mode of action groups (MOA).

We report that AMP resistance is influenced, albeit mildly, by a large set of functionally diverse genes, and yet these genes overlap only to a limited extent between AMPs. Specifically, clustering of the chemical-genetic interaction profiles revealed that the modes of action of the AMPs largely define the gene sets that influence bacterial susceptibility against them (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Additionally, antagonistic mutational effects are frequent between AMPs that disrupt the bacterial membrane versus those that act on intracellular targets (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Finally, by capitalizing on a comprehensive set of laboratory-evolved AMP-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> lineages, we show that cross-resistance rarely occurs between AMPs that belong to distinct modes of action or distinct chemical-genetic clusters (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).</p><p id="Par29">The results presented in this study may have important implications for the development of AMP-based therapies. Previous works reported several instances of cross-resistance interactions between membrane-targeting peptides (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>), however, the potential for cross-resistance across AMPs with different modes of action has remained poorly understood. Specifically, while cross-resistance between host and therapeutic AMPs is certainly a realistic danger, not all AMPs are equally prone to cross-resistance. Given the immense diversity of AMPs with major differences in physicochemical properties and resistance mechanisms, we propose that carefully chosen therapeutic candidates could mitigate the risk of cross-resistance with specific human host-defense peptides. From our screen, proline-rich AMPs are the best candidates in this respect, supporting the considerable effort that has already been taken into the clinical development of proline-rich AMP-based therapeutic applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Additionally, a distinct group of membrane-targeting AMPs (R8, TPII, and CP1) appear to be less prone to cross-resistance to the investigated human host-defense AMPs. Remarkably, these three AMPs from cluster C1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) were the only AMPs in a previous laboratory evolution experiment that did not result in any significant resistant lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, further corroborating their distinct resistance behavior. Clearly, this work made the first step in this direction and future studies should explore these possibilities. Specifically, cross-resistance patterns of proline-rich AMPs in human saliva and synthetic AMPs should also be considered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Despite these potential therapeutic implications, an important open issue is whether the cross-resistance patterns reported here can be recapitulated in species other than a laboratory <italic>E. coli</italic> strain.</p><p id="Par30">The large diversity of genes that influence AMP resistance upon overexpression indicates that bacterial susceptibility to AMPs is coupled to the general physiology of the bacterial cell, and in particular to alterations in membrane composition. This idea also provides an explanation to a recent finding that antibiotic resistance mutations in membrane proteins frequently induce collateral sensitivity to AMPs through pleiotropic side effects that alter membrane composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Indeed, the overrepresentation of collateral sensitivity interactions among AMP resistance determinants implies that evolving AMP resistance requires the optimization of many traits simultaneously. As a consequence, bacterial cells potentially harbor a large mutational target to alter AMP resistance, however, such mutations often have negative trade-offs with other cellular traits.</p><p id="Par31">Collateral sensitivity between AMPs is best exemplified by the Mla pathway. Several studies have reported the importance of Mla pathway in bacterial pathogenesis and virulence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. For example, loss-of-function mutations in Mla pathway in <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> increased the accumulation of phospholipids in the outer membrane, which mediated sensitivity to human serum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Here, we demonstrated that depletion of <italic>mlaD</italic> decreases the net negative surface charge of the bacterial membrane and, eventually, causes a somewhat increased resistance to human membrane-targeting AMPs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>), and an elevated susceptibility to intracellular-targeting AMPs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Together, our work indicates that a trade-off between membrane surface charge and membrane potential underlie collateral sensitivity interactions between membrane-targeting and intracellular-targeting AMPs upon perturbing the Mla pathway. We speculate that this trade-off could contribute to the observed variation in the expression level of Mla pathway proteins among clinical isolates of <italic>H. influenzae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par32">Whereas the mutations identified in the chemical-genetic screen generally provided relatively small increases or decreases in AMP susceptibilities, these small changes may have clinical implications for several reasons. First, mutations causing low levels of antibiotic resistance may ensure bacterial survival in antibiotic-treated hosts, as it was shown in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> isolates from cystic fibrosis patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Second, multiple small-effect resistance mutations, which typically emerge at low antimicrobial concentrations, may combine to confer clinically relevant high-level of resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Third, weak collateral sensitivity effects of antibiotic resistance mutations substantially increased the killing efficacy of AMPs against multidrug-resistant bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par33">Our results also have implications for an important but unresolved issue: why have natural AMPs that are part of the human innate immune system remained effective for millions of years without detectable resistance in several bacterial species? One possibility, supported by our work, is that bacteria may have difficulty to evolve resistance to the combination of multiple defense peptides deployed by the immune system due to negative trade-offs between them. We do not claim, however, that AMPs in clinical use would generally be resistance-free. Rather, these properties of the AMPs could be beneficial for the development of combination therapies involving AMPs in combination with antibiotics and human host peptides.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Media, bacterial strains and antimicrobial peptides</title><p id="Par34">Experiments with AMPs were conducted in minimal salts (MS) medium supplemented with MgSO<sub>4</sub> (0.1&#x02009;mM), FeCl<sub>3</sub> (0.54&#x02009;&#x003bc;g per ml), thiamin (1&#x02009;&#x003bc;g per ml), casamino acids (0.2%) and glucose (0.2%).

To obtain a negative control strain not having any overexpressed gene, the plasmid without a cloned ORF (pCA24N-noORF) was also transformed into the same <italic>E. coli</italic> strain. Then, on the pooled collection, we applied a previously reported competitive growth assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Specifically, the pooled overexpression library and the control strain were grown in parallel in MS medium supplemented with 20&#x02009;&#x000b5;g per ml chloramphenicol and the overexpression was induced by 100&#x02009;&#x000b5;M isopropyl-&#x000df;-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). After 1&#x02009;h induction, ~5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> bacterial cells from the library were inoculated into each well of a 96-well microtiter plate containing a concentration gradient of an AMP in the MS medium supplemented with 20&#x02009;&#x000b5;g per ml chloramphenicol and 100&#x02009;&#x000b5;M IPTG. At the same time, both the library and the control strain with the empty plasmid were grown in the absence of any AMPs. We took special care to grow both of these samples in the exact same conditions as the samples in the presence of AMPs. Bacterial growth was monitored in a microplate reader (Biotek Synergy 2) for 24&#x02009;h. At the end of the exponential growth phase, we selected those wells in which the doubling time of the cell population was increased by 2-fold. Then, from these wells, cells were split into four equal proportion and each was transferred into 20&#x02009;mL of MS medium supplemented with the corresponding AMP in four different concentrations in the range that slowed down growth by two-fold in the microtitre plate. Then, following exponential growth, out of the four 20&#x02009;mL cultures those that showed again a two-fold increase in doubling time were selected for further analysis. The rationale for this 2-step process was to maintain competition in exponential phase for 12 generations of growth, efficiently control the growth rate in a reproducible manner and obtain the plasmid pool with standard DNA isolation protocol (innuPREP plasmid mini Kit, Analytik Jena AG) in a yield that is enough for the downstream analysis. The cultures were vigorously shaken along the entire protocol to make sure that the cultures are completely homogeneous and therefore biasing interactions between clones (such as trans-resistance) was minimized. Each of the selected plasmid samples was digested overnight with a mixture of lambda exonuclease and exonuclease I (Fermentas) at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C to remove the genomic DNA background.

Raw sequence data were also mapped to the plasmid backbone. In order to make the mapped read counts comparable between the different samples, we carried out the following data processing workflow based on established protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, using a custom-made R script. The extra read counts deriving from genomic DNA contamination (background) were estimated by assuming that the reads mapping to the unit length of the plasmid and the ORFs should have a ratio of 1:1. The total extra read count estimated thereof was partitioned among the ORFs based on their background frequency (that is, their relative frequency obtained from the experiment involving the empty plasmid). Next, these ORF-specific backgrounds were subtracted from the read counts. Then, a loglinear transformation was carried out on the background-corrected relative read counts. Compared to the canonical logarithmic transformation, this transformation has the advantage of avoiding the inflation of data variance for ORFs with very low read counts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. The transformed relative read counts showed bimodal distributions (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17</xref>). The lower mode of the distribution corresponds to ORFs that were not present in the sample. The upper mode represents those ORFs whose growth was unaffected by overexpression (i.e., no fitness effect). To make different samples comparable, the two modes of the distribution of each sample were set to two predefined values. These values were chosen such that the original scale of the data was retained. In order to align the modes between samples, we introduced two normalization steps: one before and one after loglinear transformation. The first normalization step identified the lower mode corresponding to the absent strains and added a constant to shift the lower mode to zero. Next, we performed the loglinear transformation step described above. The second normalization step was a linear transformation moving the upper mode to a higher predefined value. Following these normalization steps, genes that were close to the lower mode in the untreated samples were discarded from the analysis as these represent strains that displayed poor growth even in the absence of drug treatment (that is, AMP sensitivity could not be reliably detected). A differential growth score (i.e., fold-change) was calculated for each gene as the ratio of the normalized relative read counts in treated and non-treated samples at the end of the competition. Fold-change values of biological replicate experiments were averaged. To determine fold-changes that are statistically significant, we estimated the variance of biological replicate measurements as follows. Due to small sample sizes (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2 for AMP treatments and <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5 for untreated competitions), gene-specific variance estimates are unreliable. Therefore, we shared information across multiple genes and AMP treatments by calculating the standard deviation as a function of normalized read counts using lowess smoothing (i.e., local regression). This procedure is based on the observation that the variance depends on the mean. Note that similar strategies are commonly used in the gene expression literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Using this estimation of standard deviation, we applied z-tests to determine whether the treated and the non-treated samples differ significantly.

This resulted in a set of 2146 genes kept for clustering. Next, we employed a distance metric, normalized variation of information, to measure distances between AMP chemical-genetic interaction profiles. The normalized variation of information is closely related to mutual information but has the advantage of being a true distance metric. Importantly, normalized variation of information gives more weight to rare overlaps of resistance/sensitivity phenotypes between AMPs, unlike the commonly used Euclidean distance.

The selection of GO reference set was based on the EcoGene database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>.

Specifically, instead of a two-fold dilution series, smaller AMP concentration steps were used (typically 1.2-fold) for two reasons. First, AMPs have steeper dose-response curves than standard antibiotics, and therefore two-fold dilutions were not enough to capture 90% growth inhibitions (i.e., MIC). Second, gene overexpressions caused typically only small changes in the MICs of AMPs and therefore higher resolution was required. The protocol was as follows. From a stock solution of an AMP, 12-steps serial dilution was prepared in fresh MS medium in 96-well microtiter plates. Each AMP was represented in 11 different concentrations (3 wells per AMP concentration per strain). Three wells contained only medium to check the growth in the absence of AMP. After overnight growth in MS medium supplemented with chloramphenicol, bacterial strains were diluted 20-fold into fresh MS medium and grown until the cell density reached OD<sub>600</sub> ~1. Cells were induced by 100&#x02009;&#x000b5;M of IPTG and incubated for 1&#x02009;h at 30&#x02009;&#x000b0;C with continuous shaking at 300&#x02009;rpm. Following incubation, approximately half-million cells were inoculated into the wells of the 96-well microtiter plate with a 96&#x02010;pin replicator. We used three independent replicates for each strain and the corresponding control. Two rows in the 96-well plate contained only MS medium in order to obtain the background OD value of the medium. Plates were incubated at 30&#x02009;&#x000b0;C with continuous shaking at 300&#x02009;rpm. After 20&#x02013;24&#x02009;h of incubation, OD<sub>600</sub> values were measured in a microplate reader (Biotek Synergy 2). After background subtraction, MIC was determined as the lowest concentration of AMP where the OD<sub>600</sub> values were less than 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Membrane surface charge measurement</title><p id="Par53">To evaluate bacterial surface charge, we performed a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled poly-L-lysine (FITC-PLL) (Sigma) binding assay. In brief, FITC-PLL is a polycationic molecule that binds to anionic lipid membrane in a charge-dependent manner and is used to investigate the interaction between cationic peptides and charged lipid bilayer membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. The assay was performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. Briefly, bacterial cells were grown overnight in MS medium, centrifuged and washed twice with 1X PBS buffer (pH 7.4). The washed bacterial cells were re-suspended in 1&#x000d7; PBS buffer to a final OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.1. A freshly prepared FITC-PLL solution was added to the bacterial suspension at a final concentration of 6.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml. The suspension was incubated at room temperature for 10&#x02009;min, and pelleted by centrifugation. The remaining amount of FITC-PLL in the supernatant was determined fluorometrically (excitation at 500&#x02009;nm and emission at 530&#x02009;nm) with or without bacterial exposure. The quantity of bound molecules was calculated from the difference between these values. A lower binding of FITC-PLL indicates a less net negative surface charge of the outer bacterial membrane.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Membrane potential measurement</title><p id="Par54">A previously described protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> was used to determine the change in transmembrane potential for <italic>mlaD</italic> overexpression and <italic>mlaD</italic> knockout strains in comparison to their control strain. Transmembrane potential (&#x00394;&#x003c8;) was measured using the BacLight&#x02122; Bacterial Membrane Potential Kit (Invitrogen). In this assay, a fluorescent membrane potential indicator dye emits green fluorescence in all bacterial cells and the emission shifts to red in the cells that maintain a high membrane potential. In this way, the ratio of red/green fluorescence provides a measure of membrane potential. Prior to the measurement bacterial cells were grown overnight in MS medium at 30&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The overnight cultures were diluted into fresh MS medium and grown until cell density reached OD<sub>600</sub> 0.5&#x02013;0.6. The grown cultures were diluted to 10<sup>6</sup>&#x02009;cells/mL in filtered PBS buffer. Then, 5&#x02009;&#x000b5;l of 3&#x02009;mM DiOC<sub>2</sub>(3) was added to each sample tube containing 500&#x02009;&#x000b5;l of bacterial suspension and incubated for 20&#x02009;min at room temperature. Following incubation, red to green fluorescence values of the samples were measured using Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (BD Facscalibur) according to the instructions of the kit&#x02019;s manufacturer. Fluorescence values were calculated relative to the control strain. Control populations treated with cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP, a chemical inhibitor of proton motive force) were used as an experimental control.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>MlaD knockout construction</title><p id="Par55">A <italic>mlaD</italic> knockout strain of <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113 carrying a kanamycin resistance cassette in the position of the gene was selected from the KEIO collection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>.
