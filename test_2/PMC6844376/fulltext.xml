However, current methods to isolate EVs encounter challenges when they are used to select specific populations. Moreover, it has been difficult to comprehensively characterize heterogeneous EV populations at the single vesicle level. Here, we robustly assessed heterogeneous EV populations from cultured cell lines via nanoparticle tracking analysis, proteomics, transcriptomics, transmission electron microscopy, and quantitative single molecule localization microscopy (qSMLM). Using qSMLM, we quantified the size and biomarker content of individual EVs. We applied qSMLM to patient plasma samples and identified a pancreatic cancer-enriched EV population.

Early detection strategies for PDAC remain inadequate [<xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]. However, encouraging results were obtained when liquid biopsies were interrogated for extracellular vesicles (EVs) [<xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>]. These membrane-encapsulated structures are continuously shed by both healthy and diseased cells. EVs originating from diverse biogenesis pathways, vary in size, and harbour distinct molecular cargo (proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids). For example, exosomes are typically 30&#x02013;100&#x000a0;nm in diameter and originate from the endosomal pathway. Microvesicles, which are more variable, are typically 100&#x02013;1000&#x000a0;nm in diameter, and originate from plasma membrane budding. EVs shed by healthy cells contain molecular regulators of normal intercellular communication [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>] whereas EVs shed by cancer cells play a role in disease pathogenesis, such as tumour initiation and progression [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>].</p><p>EVs are excellent biomarker sources. They can be collected frequently and noninvasively from accessible biofluids. However, patient biofluids contain complex mixtures of EVs originating from different healthy and diseased tissues. Two major challenges in leveraging their diagnostic potential have been to robustly isolate EVs from specific cell types and to characterize EV subpopulations at the level of individual vesicles [<xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. Here we describe a new application of quantitative single molecule localization microscopy (qSMLM) to target plasma EV populations through highly expressed membrane glycoproteins and to comprehensively characterize individual EVs.</p><p>PDAC has been associated with high levels of specific receptors and altered forms of various membrane glycoproteins [<xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]. Two important examples are epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR) and carbohydrate antigen 19&#x02013;9 (CA19-9). EGFR is both overexpressed in pancreatic tumours [<xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>] and abundant in EVs shed from PDAC cells [<xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>]. Likewise, CA19-9 is attached to a variety of membrane proteins highly expressed in PDAC [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>] and is considered a marker for long-term PDAC prognosis [<xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref>]. However, CA19-9 plasma levels have limited diagnostic potential [<xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref>].</p><p>qSMLM is a sensitive fluorescence-based imaging method that can achieve single molecule sensitivity with ~10&#x000a0;nm precision. In previous cell culture applications, qSMLM was used to determine EV numbers and sizes [<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>] or the presence of proteins of interest [<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref>]. Here, qSMLM was used to comprehensively assess EVs from both cell culture and patient plasma. We combined 1) affinity selection of EVs via EGFR or CA19-9, 2) robust molecular counting [<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>], and 3) fast data analysis. Using this strategy, we quantified both the size and membrane protein content of individual EVs. Importantly, we detected a PDAC-enriched EV subpopulation in patient plasma.</p><p>These single molecule measurements on both EGFR- and CA19-9-enriched EVs provide several important benefits. Since molecules within EVs are protected from the circulating milieu, they may represent a more accurate reflection of disease states [<xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>]. Moreover, this methodology can also be used to define EV heterogeneity. In this context, both the molecular profile and size of individual EVs may provide biological insight into the communication mechanisms between cancer cells. Finally, low volumes of plasma are required, and the approach can be easily extended to many other membrane targets. Ultimately, our goal is to use qSMLM to characterize specific EV populations for diagnostics.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Results</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>EV isolation and reproducibility</title><p>EVs from PANC-1 cells were isolated using size exclusion chromatography (SEC). SEC fractions were analysed for the following: 1) EV concentration with nanoparticle tracking analysis (NanoSight, <xref rid="F0001">Figure 1(a</xref>), light grey), 2) protein concentration with NanoDrop (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1(a</xref>), dark grey), and 3) amount of EGFR and EV markers, CD63 and TSG101, in EV fractions (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1(a</xref>), top) via Western blots. SEC fraction 8 (F8) consistently exhibited the highest amount of EVs. We thus assessed the reproducibility of F8 with three independent EV preparations analysed by LC-MS/MS. The number of unique proteins identified in each replicate was between 180&#x02013;193, with &#x0003e;95% of proteins annotated in ExoCarta and &#x0003e;95% overlap between all three replicates (Figure S1). Functional commonalities shared by EVs in F8 emerged from the functional enrichment analysis of this highly reproducible protein cargo. Unsurprisingly, terms associated with EVs were highly represented (Table S1). The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD012660.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2002"><title>Quantifying properties of fluorescent reporters</title><p>Quantification of SMLM images requires thorough characterization of fluorescently labelled probes. Here, primary antibodies (Abs) were labelled with approximately one Alexa Fluor 647 (AF647) dye (see <italic>Methods</italic>). However, small labelling heterogeneity is expected even with optimized protocols. To minimize this effect, we calculated the average number of appearances for fluorescently labelled Abs using a surface assay for molecular isolation (SAMI) [<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>], Figure S2. This approach allowed us to directly test photophysical properties of labelled Abs using the same optical setup and imaging conditions as those used for detecting EVs. Concentrations of fluorescently labelled Abs were also assessed with dSTORM using PANC-1 EVs. Compared to staining with 13&#x000a0;nM of Ab (2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL), staining with 1&#x000a0;nM of Ab produced less signal and isolated fewer EVs, whereas staining with 30&#x000a0;nM of Ab produced more noise. Additionally, similar localization densities were obtained on EVs stained with 13&#x000a0;nM and 30&#x000a0;nM of Abs. While every effort was made to properly quantify molecular content, reported densities represents estimates for given processing conditions. Thus, we report detected densities, rather than absolute molecular densities.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2003"><title>qSMLM on cell line EVs</title><p>We assessed PANC-1 EVs from SEC F8. After staining (see <italic>Methods</italic>), EVs were affinity isolated onto coverslips using the clinical Ab cetuximab against EGFR (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1(b</xref>), left). EVs were subsequently immobilized via fixation (see <italic>Methods</italic>). This immunocapture method facilitated efficient SMLM imaging. Simulations were performed thereafter to identify optimal NIS-Elements processing filters for the qSMLM data (Figure S3A,B), helping to remove signal unassociated with EVs (e.g. fluorescent molecules not bound to EVs, Figure S3B). Rapid Voronoi tessellation was subsequently used to extract details on EV diameter and the number of molecules per EV (Figure S3C,D); see <italic>Methods</italic>). Additionally, we showed that Brownian fluctuations were largely negligible in our characterization of isolated EVs, Figure S4.</p><p><xref rid="F0001">Figure 1(b</xref>), right, shows qSMLM images obtained when cetuximab isolated EVs were stained with AF647 coupled to a membrane binding lectin called wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-AF647); additional EV images are shown in Figure S5. qSMLM was next used to establish the size of isolated EVs (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1(c</xref>)). The average EV diameter was 72&#x000a0;nm with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.6. These measurements were validated with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Largely intact and unaggregated EVs were observed (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1(d</xref>), left) with an average EV diameter of 75&#x000a0;nm and CV of 0.5 (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1(d</xref>), right). We also examined the EVs eluted in fraction 10 (Figure S5B, Figure S6). As expected from the SEC elution profile, both qSMLM and TEM detected fewer EVs with smaller diameters in fraction 10.

Images are shown in Figures S5C&#x02013;G and a scheme in Figure S7A. The qSMLM characterization is shown in <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(a</xref>). Each black dot represents one EV and provides two corresponding values: the number of detected EGFR receptors on the membrane surface (y-axis) and the apparent EV diameter using cetuximab-AF647 as a reporter (x-axis). On average, EVs had 28 detected EGFRs and a diameter of 51&#x000a0;nm. Measurements of replicates were highly reproducible (Figure S8A). Further, simulated EVs were generated from a random sampling of experimental data to demonstrate that these nanoscale details are associated with a distinct distribution of EVs (Figure S7B). As expected, the average EV size obtained from qSMLM with cetuximab-AF647 decreased from SEC fraction 6 to SEC fraction 10 (Figure S7C).</p><p>Our method to detect EGFR-enriched EVs was sensitive. The number of detected EVs correlated with the amount of EVs incubated onto coverslips across a wide concentration range (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(b</xref>), Figure S5C,D). Several controls were performed to validate the method. A negligible number of EVs were detected under the following conditions: 1) EV membranes were disrupted with Triton-X 100 (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(c</xref>), Figure S5E); 2) EVs were incubated with cetuximab-AF647 and then placed onto coverslips coated with either PEG (Figure S5F, Figure S9A) or anti-rabbit secondary Ab (Figure S5G, Figure S9B); and 3) EVs labelled only with CM-DiI were incubated onto coverslips coated with anti-human Fc secondary Ab (Figure S9C).</p><p>We also assessed EVs from normal human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (HPDEC) purified by SEC. F8 was assessed for both EGFR and EV marker content (Figure S9D). Using qSMLM, we detected fewer EVs with lower EGFR content from HPDECs compared to PANC-1 cells (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(d</xref>), Figure S5H). No significant difference in EV diameter was observed between the two cell lines. qSMLM replicates were also reproducible (Figure S8B).</p><p>Additionally, we characterized CA19-9 content in SEC F8 EVs from PANC-1 cells and HPDECs (Figure S5I). The Ab against CA19-9 is well characterized, extremely selective, and has been extensively used in biomarker discovery [<xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>]. Affinity isolation with the anti CA19-9 Ab-AF647 led to a narrower EV size range for both cell lines. Compared to HPDECs, PANC-1 cells yielded significantly more EVs with higher CA19-9 content (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(e,f)</xref>). While the detected target densities depend on experimental conditions (e.g. optical setup, Ab quality, and labelling efficiency), these numbers are reproducible and can be used to compare samples (Figure S8C,D).

We characterized the EV concentration of F8 using nanoparticle tracking analysis and adjusted the starting concentration of EVs for qSMLM to be identical for each patient sample (diluted to 7&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>8</sup> EVs/150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L). Samples were affinity isolated with either cetuximab-AF647 or anti CA19-9 Ab-AF647 (<xref rid="F0003">Figure 3(a&#x02013;c)</xref>, Figure S5J,K, and Figure S11). Significantly more EVs were isolated from PDAC patients compared to healthy subjects. An average of 5- and 15-fold increases in EV numbers were observed for EGFR and CA19-9, respectively (Figure S11E). EVs from the plasma of PDAC patients showed complex and heterogeneous distributions. We detected multiple populations, one resembling that found in healthy subjects and an additional PDAC-associated population. We quantified this PDAC-associated population by negative gating: fewer than 5% of the total healthy subject EVs were contained within the gated region (grey polygons, <xref rid="F0003">Figure 3(c</xref>)). The PDAC-enriched area contained EVs larger in diameter but with fewer target molecules, possibly indicating a microvesicle enrichment. In this region, significantly more EVs were isolated from PDAC patients compared to healthy subjects. An average of 35- and 130-fold increases in EV numbers were observed for EGFR and CA19-9, respectively (<xref rid="F0003">Figure 3(d</xref>)). Importantly, our results are in agreement with patient characteristics. Taken altogether, our method appears to be sensitive for PDAC detection (Figure S11G).

In cancer, EVs can mediate tumour development, vascularization, and metastasis [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]. Since EVs are a source of cell-specific bioactive molecules, they represent ideal candidates for biomedical and therapeutic applications. However, it has been challenging to assess individual, cell-specific EVs from complex patient biofluids. Here, we extensively characterized EVs from cell lines using nanoparticle tracking analysis, proteomics, transcriptomics, TEM, and qSMLM. We extended our methodology to patient EVs. We determined EV concentration, size distribution, and molecular content of EGFR and CA19-9. Using these parameters, we defined a pancreatic cancer-enriched EV population.</p><p>Few methods comprehensively assess EVs at the single vesicle level. Electron microscopy quantifies EV size [<xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref>], nanoparticle tracking analysis measures both EV size and numbers, tunable resistive pulse sensing measures EV size, numbers and charge, and high-resolution flow cytometry assesses EV numbers and membrane protein expression levels [<xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0021">21</xref>]. Studies have provided conflicting data regarding absolute quantification of EVs [<xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0022">22</xref>]. Here we provide an approach that can efficiently assess EV numbers, size, and molecular content from a limited amount of sample material. The present study advances qSMLM to assess pancreatic cancer-enriched EV populations from both cell lines and human plasma. Importantly, our approach can be extended to other cell- or tissue-specific EV populations for diagnostic applications.</p><p>To reproducibly isolate EVs, we used SEC. Per recent guidelines [<xref rid="CIT0023">23</xref>], we verified that EV fractions contained EV specific markers, CD63 and TSG101. Using TEM, we confirmed EVs were largely unaggregated, intact, and efficiently separated from soluble factors in media (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). The SEC isolation method was shown to be highly reproducible through proteomic and transcriptomic analyses. Additionally, using the information on EV cargo obtained through these types of analyses, other molecular candidates can be selected in the future for isolation of PDAC-enriched EVs.</p><p>We utilized surface glycoproteins enriched in PDAC to affinity isolate vesicles and established an analysis pipeline to quantify EV size and membrane content. Fluorescently labelled Abs were used to detect EVs isolated from PANC-1 cells (pancreatic cancer cells) and HPDECs (normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cells) (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>). We detected a greater number of EVs with higher EGFR and CA19-9 content from PANC-1 cells compared to HPDECs. Our independent repeats provided reproducible results (Figure S8). Thus, the spread in size and receptor content is likely due to inherent EV heterogeneity. Our data in cell lines indicate that qSMLM can identify signatures associated with particular EV populations.</p><p>Interestingly, staining with cetuximab-AF647, compared to staining with WGA-AF647, yielded a smaller apparent EV diameter. We speculate this may be caused by a lower EGFR density on larger (&#x0003e;100&#x000a0;nm diameter) EVs and non-uniform EGFR distributions (Figure S3C). Simulations guided by experimental results (Figure S7B) suggest that the distribution of EGFR on membranes (i.e. membrane areas without detected EGFR) may contribute to the slight underestimation of sizes.</p><p>We extended our methodology to more complex clinical samples. EVs from both the plasma of healthy subjects and PDAC patients were assessed for the PDAC-relevant markers, EGFR and CA19-9. EVs from the plasma of PDAC patients showed complex and heterogeneous distributions. The PDAC-associated population included larger EVs with fewer receptors (<xref rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>). This result could indicate that more abundant shedding of EGFR- and CA19-9-enriched microvesicles is characteristic of PDAC tumours. This is consistent with a previous study indicating that EGFR can transfer between cell populations through microvesicles, increasing oncogenic activity [<xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref>]. Our blinded qSMLM analysis indicated that P1 and P4 had highly elevated numbers of EGFR- and CA19-9-enriched EVs in PDAC-associated EV populations. P3, however, had minimally elevated numbers of EGFR- and CA19-9-enriched EVs in PDAC-associated EV populations. Clinical data for P1 and P4 displayed elevated serum CA19-9 and these patients ultimately succumbed to the disease. P3 did not show elevated serum CA19-9 at the start of the trial when plasma was collected. Thus, the comparison of qSMLM results to clinical data demonstrates that qSMLM has diagnostic potential and that our overall approach may be sensitive for effective PDAC detection.</p></sec><sec id="S0004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The advancement presented here allowed us to characterize distinct populations of EVs by quantifying the size and detected receptor content of individual vesicles. Furthermore, we differentiated PDAC-enriched EVs from other EV populations within complex biofluids. In conclusion, our qSMLM approach can be extended to the study of EVs from other diseases and a range of molecular EV targets broadly used in research and medicine.</p></sec><sec id="S0005"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S0005-S2001"><title>Cell culture</title><p>PANC-1 cells (ATCC) were cultured in RPMI-1640 phenol red-free media supplemented with 10% (v/v) EV depleted FBS (Gibco; A2720801), 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo; 15140148), 2 mM glutamax (Gibco; 35030061), and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco; 11360070).

Specifically, a spherical coordinate system was established to place localizations, in three dimensions, for an individual EV. The radial distance, polar angle, and azimuthal angle were all given levels of randomization (MATLAB <italic>rand</italic> function) within the space characterized by possible EV diameters, given a defined number of localizations. Features were also incorporated in the simulations to ensure that the majority of EVs were not perfectly spherical in shape. This included a second round of randomization on any one of the three dimensions to either extend or shorten the distance by the average localization precision (predetermined experimentally to be ~8&#x000a0;nm). In addition to the assigned random spherical coordinate, each localization was further provided with some average spatial error (&#x0003c;8&#x000a0;nm) to simulate placement on the &#x0201c;uneven&#x0201d; membrane surface of a given EV. The total number of localizations for each EV was provided by randomly sampling experimental data (approximately an Inverse-gamma distribution).

Most abundant precursor ions with charge states between 2&#x02013;7 were taken up for MS2 scan using High Energy Collision (HCD) dissociation and detection in the iontrap with the following settings: quadrupole isolation mode enabled, isolation window at 1.6 m/z, AGC target of 5E3 with maximum ion injection time of 35&#x000a0;ms and HCD collision energy of 35%. To avoid resampling of the same peaks, dynamic exclusion was set to 60&#x000a0;seconds.</p><p>Mass spectra were searched using Proteome Discoverer 2.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Mascot 2.6.0 (Matrix Science) against a SwissProt/UniprotKB <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> database (downloaded Jan 2017), allowing for tryptic rules and up to 2 missed cleavages, fixed cysteine carbamidomethylation, variable methionine oxidation, and N-terminal acetylation. Exosomal proteins were annotated using ExoCarta [<xref rid="CIT0030">30</xref>]. Enriched biological processes were determined using ToppFun [<xref rid="CIT0031">31</xref>], from proteins identified in 3 out of 3 replicates.</p></sec><sec id="S0005-S2013"><title>RNA isolation and quantification</title><p>RNA was isolated from vesicle fractions 7, 8, and 9, each in triplicate, from the PANC-1 cancer cell line and HPDEC control cell line. Total RNA was extracted from 520&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of isolated vesicles using Total Exosome RNA and Protein Isolation Kit (same as miRVana; Thermo Fisher, Cat. No. 4478545) with a second extraction as before [<xref rid="CIT0032">32</xref>]. Each isolated RNA sample was DNase treated with a TURBO DNA-<italic>free</italic> Kit (Thermo Fisher, Cat. No. AM1907), then cleaned and concentrated (RNA Clean &#x00026; Concentrator, Zymo Research, Cat. No. R1016, following Appendix C in the kit protocol). The RNA was then quantified with Quant-iT Ribogreen RNA Assay (Thermo Fisher, Cat. No.: R11490).</p></sec><sec id="S0005-S2014"><title>Library preparation and whole transcriptome sequencing</title><p>Because there was enough RNA from PANC-1 EVs to examine both small and longer RNAs (requires two types of sample preparation) the sample was split in two with one half going into whole transcriptome library preparation and the other half going into small RNA library preparation. Input amounts were adjusted for the amount of RNA in that cell line and that fraction (see Table S2). There was not enough RNA from HPDEC EVs for both preparations, and only the whole transcriptome library preparation was made and sequenced.</p><p>Whole transcriptome: For each RNA sample, indexed, Illumina-compatible, double-stranded cDNA libraries were synthesized from total RNA with Takara Bio&#x02019;s SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v2 &#x02013; Pico Input Mammalian kit (Takara Bio, Cat. No. 634411). Library preparation included chemical RNA fragmentation (94&#x000b0;C for 2&#x000a0;min), a 5-cycle indexing PCR, ribosomal cDNA depletion, and a 14-16-cycle enrichment PCR. Total RNA input was normalized to the lowest amount of RNA among technical triplicates within each vesicle fraction and each cell line, and the number of enrichment PCR cycles was dictated by the total RNA input according to manufacturer recommendations.</p><p>Each library was measured for size with Agilent&#x02019;s High Sensitivity D1000 Screen Tape and reagents (Agilent, Cat. No. 5067&#x02013;5584 &#x00026; 5067&#x02013;5603) and concentration with KAPA SYBR FAST Universal qPCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Cat. No. KK4824). Libraries were combined into two equimolar pools which were measured for size and concentration. Each pool was hybridized onto a paired-end flowcell (Illumina, Cat. No. PE-402-4002) with a 1% v/v PhiX Control v3 spike-in (Illumina, Cat. No. FC-110-3001) using Illumina&#x02019;s HiSeq Rapid Duo cBot Sample Loading Kit (Illumina, Cat. No. CT-403-2001) on a cBot. Each template-hybridized flowcell was then clustered and sequenced on Illumina&#x02019;s HiSeq 2500 with HiSeq Rapid v2 chemistry (Illumina, Cat. No. FC-402-4022). The first and second reads were each 83 bases.</p></sec><sec id="S0005-S2015"><title>Small RNA</title><p>For the PANC-1 cell line there was enough RNA to sequence both a small and a long RNA library for each replicate of fractions 7, 8, and 9, however, in the HPDEC cell line, the RNA was limited, and we sequenced only a long RNA library for each fraction and each replicate. For the PANC-1 EVs, small RNA libraries were generated using NEXTFlex Small RNA Library Prep Kit v2 (Cat #5132&#x02013;03). The manufacturer instructions were followed through PCR amplification. The optional stop point was used after the RT reaction prior to clean up and PCR amplification. Samples underwent 18 cycles of PCR amplification. Following PCR amplification, the libraries were run on a 6% TBE gel for 30&#x000a0;minutes at 200&#x000a0;V, and the sample between 150 to 170&#x000a0;bp was excised. Samples were quantified with the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit (5067&#x02013;4626; Agilent). An equimolar pool of the samples was created, and the pool was denatured and clustered on a single read Illumina V3 flowcell (GD-401-3001; Illumina) and run on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform (HiSeq 2500; Illumina) for 50 cycles with a 7 cycle indexing read.</p></sec><sec id="S0005-S2016"><title>Fastq generation, genome alignment, and differential expression analysis</title><p>Fastqs were generated using bcl2fastq v2.19.1.403 using default parameters. 3 nt were trimmed from the reverse read, as suggested by the SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq protocol, with cutadapt v1.17. Trimmed reads were then aligned to the GRCh38 genome with STAR v2.6.1d, and counted with featureCounts v1.6.3, (part of the subread package) using a non-redundant genome annotation combined from GENCODE 29 and LNCipedia5.2. Differential expression analysis was performed with DESeq 1.22.1.</p></sec><sec id="S0005-S2017"><title>Patient cohort</title><p>The qSMLM team was blinded to patient characteristics until all data acquisition and analyses was completed. All investigators were aware of healthy subject samples. Plasma samples were obtained under Institutional Review Board (IRB) number 015&#x02013;196 (Baylor Scott &#x00026; White Research Institute) and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The patients analysed in this study were enrolled as part of the early-pancreatic cancer detection initiative at the Baylor Scott &#x00026; White Research Institute, where plasma specimens were collected from patients with various stages of PDAC, pre-cancerous lesions and healthy subject controls. Analysed plasma samples and the clinical test for soluble serum CA19-9 were collected pre-neoadjuvant therapy. Additionally, plasma from two healthy subjects (H5, H6) was obtained under IRB 2013116 (TGen) and informed consent was obtained from all subjects.</p></sec><sec id="S0005-S2018"><title>Statistical information</title><p>All cell culture EV experiments were run in triplicates using separate cell culture preparations (biological replicates), with five fields of view (FOV, technical replicates). Each patient and healthy subject sample were run in triplicate, with five FOV (total FOV&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;15), except for the CA19-9 analysis, which were run in duplicate with 7 or 8 FOV (total FOV&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;15), due to a lack of sufficient sample volume for triplicate runs. Mean and SEM were determined using GraphPad Prism Software, Microsoft Excel, and MATLAB. One-tailed Student T-tests comparing two-samples of unequal variance were used to determine statistical significance. The coefficient of variation was used to describe the variance within EV populations. To determine the statistical significance of variation between the distributions of vesicles the data was divided into histograms and the SEM of each bin count was taken to be the square root of the bin count. A chi-squared test was then used to compare the histograms. Statistical significance was set at *p&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;0.05, **p&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;0.01, ***p&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;0.0001. Scatter plots and histograms were generated in MATLAB, and graphs were made using GraphPad Prism Software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.graphpad.com">https://www.graphpad.com</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Dr. D.
