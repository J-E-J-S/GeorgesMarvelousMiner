Introduction</title><p>The Cry3 insecticidal proteins of <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> (Bt) are toxic to larvae of beetles (Order: Coleoptera) that are some of the most important agricultural pests worldwide. The widest usage of Cry3 proteins is found in corn via in planta expression of Cry3Aa and Cry3Bb for rootworm management. The Cry3Aa protein was also shown to be produced in genetically modified potatoes for the control of the Colorado potato beetle (CPB) [<xref rid="B1-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. CPB is a serious pest of potato, due to development of resistance to many chemical insecticides. Alyokhin et al. (2007) [<xref rid="B3-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] reported increasing resistance in CPB against neonicotinoids, a chemical class that had been effective in controlling CPB populations. Novodor<sup>TM</sup>, a Bt biopesticide containing Cry3Aa crystal proteins and spores, is active against CPB and is reportedly effective against the first and second larval stages but not in the third instar and later stages [<xref rid="B4-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These limitations to Bt control of CPB are driving factors in the development of a Bt synergist.</p><p>Cadherin proteins have domains called cadherin repeats (CR) that are flanked by structural elements, which together functionally enable cell adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, and morphogenesis. In insects, cadherins received attention for their roles in Bt Cry action and acquired insect resistance (reviewed in [<xref rid="B6-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). With respect to Coleoptera, cadherins have inherent physiological roles while functioning as adventitious receptors of Cry3 toxins in some insect species, including mealworms <italic>Tenebrio molitor</italic>, <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>, and <italic>Alphitobius diaperinius</italic> [<xref rid="B8-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. After insects ingest Cry proteins, the activated Cry toxin binds cadherins tethered to the external side of midgut membranes, with high affinity, then the toxin oligomerizes and inserts into the membrane. A surprising aspect of Cry- cadherin interactions is that peptide fragments of cadherins containing binding sites can synergize Cry toxicity to insects [<xref rid="B11-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In some cases, the cadherin fragment induces toxin oligomerization, replacing the midgut cadherin binding step [<xref rid="B8-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B12-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Park et al. (2009) [<xref rid="B14-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] identified a cadherin fragment CR8-10 from western corn rootworm (WCR), <italic>Diabrotica virgifera virgifera</italic> cadherin [<xref rid="B15-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], as a synergist of Cry3Aa and Cry3Bb toxicity. The DvCad1-CR8-10 fragment bound Cry3Aa and Cry3Bb with a high nanomolar affinity and enhanced Cry3 toxicity to the larvae of the Colorado potato beetle (CPB), <italic>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</italic> (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), and the lesser mealworm (LMW), <italic>A. diaperinius</italic> (Coleoptera: <italic>Tenebrionidae</italic>) [<xref rid="B14-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Recent evidence [<xref rid="B16-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] showed that DvCad1 is probably not a receptor of Cry3Aa as knock-down of DvCad1 by RNA inhibition (RNAi) did not reduce Cry3Aa toxicity.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the location of Cry3Bb sites in DvCad1-CR8-10 and demonstrated that CR8, CR9, and CR10 each had a high-affinity Cry3Bb binding site and that CR8 and CR10 enhanced Cry3Bb toxicity against CPB and LMW. Each Cry3Bb binding site located in CR8-10 was bound by a common site on Cry3Bb. A 26 amino acid region of DvCad1-CR10 was identified as critical for Cry3Bb binding and toxicity enhancement against CPB and LMW.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-toxins-11-00386"><title>2.

Leaflets of potato were sprayed with suspensions of Cry3Bb crystals alone or with DvCad1-CR inclusions, and were fed to the first instar CPB larvae. The concentration of Cry3Bb crystals on the potato leaves caused about 20% mortality against the first instar CPB larvae. The addition of DvCad1-CR8, -CR10, and CR8-10 inclusions at a 1:10 (Cry3Bb:DvCad1-CR peptide) mass ratio to Cry3Bb, each, increased larval mortality to 41.0 &#x000b1; 2.9%, 42.1 &#x000b1; 2.1%, and 43.3 &#x000b1; 3.8%, respectively. The mortality of the CPB larvae-fed Cry3Bb plus DvCad1-CR9 at 23.1 &#x000b1; 1.6% was not significantly different from Cry3Bb alone.</p><p>We tested the addition of DvCad1 CR peptides on the Cry3Bb-induced mortality to LMW larvae, using 4 &#x003bc;g Cry3Bb/cm<sup>2</sup> diet surface that caused 20% larval mortality.

Similar to the results of the CPB bioassays, CR9 peptide did not increase LMW mortality, relative to the Cry3Bb alone. DvCad1-CR peptides alone were not toxic to the first instar CPB larvae or LMW. Peptide CR10, of the three individual CR units, was the most active synergist of the Cry3Bb in the CPB and LMW larval bioassays.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-toxins-11-00386"><title>2.3. CR8, CR9, and CR10 Peptides Bound Cry3Bb and Competed for the Same Binding Site on Cry3Bb</title><p>Binding of DvCad1 CR8-10 peptides to Cry3Bb toxin was analyzed by an ELISA protein binding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00386-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Chymotrypsinized-Cry3Bb was 55-kDa (data not shown), as expected [<xref rid="B17-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Biotin-labeled DvCad1 CR peptides were bound Cry3Bb specifically, saturably, and with high affinity (CR8 <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> = 4.9 &#x000b1; 1.4 nM; CR9 <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> = 28.2 &#x000b1; 5.5 nM; CR10 <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> = 4.6 &#x000b1; 1.4 nM; and CR8-10 <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> = 2.1 &#x000b1; 0.6 nM). The CR9 peptide, with the lowest Cry3Bb binding affinity of the CR8 to 10 peptides was also the peptide without Cry3Bb synergy.</p><p>Competition for a shared CR binding site on Cry3Bb was analyzed by measuring the labeled-CR fragment binding to Cry3Bb in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled CR fragment. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00386-f004">Figure 4</xref>A, biotinylated-DvCad1-CR8-10 (10 nM) was competed by increasing the amounts of unlabeled CR8, CR9, CR10, or CR8-10. Binding of biotin DvCad1-CR8-10 to Cry3Bb was displaced by increasing concentrations of the unlabeled CR8, CR10, and CR8-10 peptide, which evidenced that CR8 and CR10 acted interchangeably in reducing CR8-10 binding to Cry3Bb. A higher concentration of CR9 was required before a reduction of biotin-DvCad1-CR8-10 binding was measured and the extent of competition was found to be less than that with CR8, CR10, or CR8-10 peptides. To further test the similarity of interactions between CR8 and CR10 peptides with Cry3Bb, we biotinylated CR8 and CR10, and measured the capacity of increasing amounts of CR8, CR10, and CR8-10, to compete binding to Cry3Bb. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00386-f004">Figure 4</xref>B,C, the competition curves were similar for biotin-DvCad1-CR8 and biotin-DvCad1-CR10. These competition results agreed with the saturation binding results, revealing similar affinities for the CR8 and CR10 peptide binding to Cry3Bb, and additionally suggest that they bind the same site(s) on Cry3Bb.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-toxins-11-00386"><title>2.4. The N-Terminal Third of DvCad1-CR10 Binds Cry3Bb and Enhances Cry3Bb Toxicity to Coleopteran Larvae</title><p>We removed the overlapping regions of DvCad1-CR10 by in-frame deletion to construct CR10/DelA, CR10/DelB, and CR10/DelC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00386-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). Each construct was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> as an inclusion made of 10-kDa CR10/Del peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00386-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). Cry3Bb was fed to CPB larvae alone or with 1:10 mass ratio of CR10/Del peptide and mortality was scored after 3 days. Peptide DvCad1-CR10 increased larval mortality from 17.7 &#x000b1; 1.1% to 38.8 &#x000b1; 2.8%, and peptides CR10/DelB and CR10/DelC increased mortality to 33.3 &#x000b1; 1.9% and 34.4 &#x000b1; 1.1%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00386-f005">Figure 5</xref>C); in contrast CR10/DelA inclusions did not increase Cry3Bb toxicity to CPB or LMW.</p><p>The binding properties of CR10 deletion peptides were compared with CR10 in saturation and competition binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00386-f006">Figure 6</xref>). While each peptide bound saturably with calculated <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> affinities for DvCad1-CR10/DelA, -CR10/DelB, and -CR10/DelC peptides for Cry3Bb of 20.6 &#x000b1; 1.8 nM, 6.4 &#x000b1; 2.2 nM, and 5.6 &#x000b1; 1.8 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00386-f006">Figure 6</xref>A&#x02013;C), the lower affinity of CR10/DelA was consistent with a lack of Cry3Bb enhancement. In competition binding assays, biotin-DvCad1-CR10 binding to Cry3Bb was reduced by increasing the concentrations of the unlabeled DvCad1-CR10, CR10/DelA, CR10/DelB, and CR10/DelC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00386-f006">Figure 6</xref>E). More CR10/DelA was required before biotin-DvCad1-CR10 binding was reduced, a result consistent with a reduced binding affinity to Cry3Bb.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-toxins-11-00386"><title>2.5. A 26-Amino Acid (1254I - S1279) Peptide from Region A of CR10 Enhances Cry3Bb Toxicity</title><p>Reduced Cry3Bb binding and a lack of toxicity enhancement by CR10/DelA, identified 51-aa residues deleted from fragment CR10 as being important to the Cry3Bb interactions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00386-f007">Figure 7</xref>A shows the synthetic 26-aa residue CR10/A peptide used to directly test the toxicity enhancement function for this small region of CR10.

Discussion</title><p>This study identified multiple sites on DvCad1-CR8-10 involved in Cry3Bb high-affinity binding and synergy [<xref rid="B14-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. While CR8, CR9, and CR10 each bound Cry3Bb toxin with high affinity; the CR8 and CR10 regions with binding constants of <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> = 5 nM synergized Cry3Bb toxicity to CPB and LMW, but CR9 peptide with a <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> = 28 nM did not. The <italic>E. coli</italic> expressed peptides CR8 and CR9 had apparent molecular sizes on the SDS-PAGE that were larger than expected. Particularly for CR9, we did not know if the two-times difference between the apparent and calculated sizes for the peptide, affected the Cry3Bb binding or synergy. Multiple Cry toxin binding sites occurred on different CR regions of an insect&#x02019;s midgut cadherins. For example, lepidopteran active Cry1Ab recognized three binding sites on <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> cadherin, with the binding site in the CR region nearest to the plasma membrane being considered to be the most important to Cry1Ab toxicity [<xref rid="B18-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Fragment CR10 of DvCad1 contained multiple Cry3Bb binding sites. Region A of CR10 (residues 1227&#x02013;1277) contained a site that bound Cry3Bb with a <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of 5 nM and regions B and C had a binding site with a <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> = 20 nM. Fragments CR10/DelA and CR9 bound Cry3Bb at <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> = 20 nM and 28 nM and both failed to synergize toxicity; other DvCad1 fragments bound Cry3B at <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> = 5 nM and synergized higher toxicity. These results suggest that seemingly small differences in the affinities of the cadherin fragment&#x02013;Cry interaction, impact the synergistic effects of a cadherin fragment.</p><p>Three domain Cry toxins bind patterns of amino acids via domain 2 loops, based on inverted hydropathic complementarity [<xref rid="B19-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Correspondingly, insect cadherins have residue motifs with hydropathic complementarity matching to the Cry domain 2 loops. Cry3Aa binding sites are identified in <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> and <italic>Tenebrio molitor</italic>, and a Cry3Bb binding site was predicted in <italic>A. diaperinus</italic> cadherin [<xref rid="B8-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. There was no obvious Cry3 binding motif within the CR10/A 26-residue peptide to fit into the complementarity pattern; the peptide did have four residues which overlapped a predicted Cry3 binding motif (1277GDLSVIGN1284). However, fragment CR10/DelB which binds and synergizes Cry3Bb, did not have these aa residues, a result which argued against 1277GDLS1280 as being involved in toxin interaction. Seven aa residues (1254IYYFYS1260) of synthetic CR10/A peptide overlapped CR10/DelB and CR10/DelB, suggesting that those 7 aa residues could be involved in Cry3Bb interactions. Additional experimentation is needed to identify the specific Cry3Bb binding motif in CR10/A peptide.</p><p>How do cadherin fragments synergize three-domain Cry protein toxicity to insect larvae? Cry toxins form oligomers, in vitro, upon contact with synergistic cadherin fragments [<xref rid="B12-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The ability of a cadherin fragment to augment a step in Cry action, such as oligomerization, is consistent with the ability of a cadherin fragment to restore Cry3Bb susceptibility after a cadherin loss knockdown by RNAi [<xref rid="B10-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is interesting that DvCad1 fragments enhanced Cry toxicity against WCR [<xref rid="B14-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], even if DvCad1 was probably not a Cry receptor in [<xref rid="B16-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Similarly, cadherin might not be a receptor in <italic>L. decimlineata</italic> as ADAM10 metalloprotease is the only identified Cry3 receptor in that species [<xref rid="B20-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The implication is that Cry contact with a specific type of binding motif is a key step in three-domain Cry toxin action. Such a functional step could occur in vivo upon contact with a cadherin receptor, a similar motif on sodium solute receptor, or when the cadherin fragment is fed per oss with Cry toxin. DvCad1 is probably not a Cry3 receptor in WCR as knock-down of DvCad1 expression did not reduce Cry3Aa susceptibility [<xref rid="B16-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The ability of DvCad1 fragments and CR10/A peptide to enhance Cry3Bb toxicity suggests that synergistic cadherin fragments do augment a step in three-domain Cry toxin action.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-toxins-11-00386"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>Our research focused on the Cry3Bb-binding and toxicity regions of DvCad1-CR8-10. We identified CR8 and CR10 fragments as having high nM Cry3Bb-binding and toxicity-enhancement properties. Deletion analyses of CR10 identified a region involved in Cry3Bb interactions, and 26-aa CR10/A peptide was sufficient for both binding and toxicity enhancement. Further research of the interaction between Cry3 toxins and DvCad1 could help to better understand the insecticidal mechanism of Bt toxin and the phenomenon of toxicity enhancement by cadherin and could lead us to open a new prospect in the field of pest control.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-toxins-11-00386"><title>5.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications were performed using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) with pET-30/DvCad1-CR8-10 as a template, through 25 cycles of 94 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, 55 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, and 68 &#x000b0;C for 1 min. The strategy for deleting a single fragment from DvCad1-CR8-10 was based on the Stratagene Quick Change method, as described in [<xref rid="B11-toxins-11-00386" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Briefly, 5&#x02019;- and 3&#x02019;- primer pairs containing terminal EcoRI cleavage sites were designed, complementary to the region to be deleted.

The coding regions of all deleted plasmids were sequenced. The DvCad1-CR9 (<sup>1101</sup>Q-F<sup>1218</sup>) fragment was cloned by PCR, using the pET-30/DvCad1-CR8-10 plasmid as a template with CR9/FWD, which had an EcoRI site, and CR9/REV, which had a HindIII site. The PCR product was inserted between the EcoRI and HindIII cleavage sites of plasmid pET-30a (+) (Novagen, Madison, WI) and transformed into the <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 after ligation.

Microtiter plates (high-binding, 96-well Immulon 2HB plates; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA) were coated with 1.0 &#x000b5;g Cry3Bb/well in 50 &#x003bc;L coating buffer (100 mM Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, pH 9.6), with or without the 1000-fold molar excess unlabeled DvCad1-CR peptides. In competition binding assays, 20 nM biotinylated DvCad1-CR peptide was mixed with increasing concentrations of the unlabeled DvCad1-CR peptides. Cry3Bb toxin-coated or peptide-coated plates were washed and incubated with horse radish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (SA-HRP; Pierce), and then incubated with an HRP chromogenic substrate (1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., USA), after washing, to detect bound SA-HRP. Color development was stopped by adding 3M sulfuric acid, and absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (MDS Analytical Technologies, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

To study the synergistic effects of DvCad1 peptides in bioassays against CPB, aliquots of 5.0 &#x000b5;g/mL of DvCad1-CR peptide inclusions were added to 0.5 &#x003bc;g/mL of Cry3Bb inclusions, to yield a final 1:10 (Cry3Bb:DvCad1-CR) mass ratio suspension. Suspensions were sprayed on the potato leaves, which were then air-dried in a fume hood for 15 min. Each bioassay was conducted with 30 larvae per replicate and three replicates per treatment. Control bioassays were performed using BSA that did not enhance the toxicity of the Cry3Bb toxin.</p><p>A colony of LMWs was founded from the adults, provided by Dr. Nancy Hinkle (University of Georgia).
