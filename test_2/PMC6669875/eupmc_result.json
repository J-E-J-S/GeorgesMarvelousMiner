    "Cry3Bb toxin from Bacillus thuringiensis is an important insecticidal protein due to its potency against coleopteran pests, especially rootworms. Cadherin, a protein in the insect midgut epithelium, is a receptor of Cry toxins; in some insect species toxin-binding domains of cadherins-synergized Cry toxicity. Previously, we reported that the DvCad1-CR8-10 fragment of Diabrotica virgifera virgifera cadherin-like protein (GenBank Accession #EF531715) enhanced Cry3Bb toxicity to the Colorado Potato Beetle (CPB), Leptinotarsa decimlineata (L. decimlineata). We report that individual CR domains of the DvCad1-CR8-10 fragment were found to have strong binding affinities to Î±-chymotrypsin-treated Cry3Bb. The dissociation constant (Kd) of Cry3Bb binding to the CR8, CR9, and CR10 domain was 4.9 nM, 28.2 nM, and 4.6 nM, respectively. CR8 and CR10, but not CR9, enhanced Cry3Bb toxicity against L. decimlineata and the lesser mealworm Alphitobius diaperinus neonates. In-frame deletions of the DvCad1-CR10 open reading frame defined a high-affinity binding and synergistic site to a motif in residues I1226-D1278. A 26 amino acid peptide from the high affinity Cry3Bb-binding region of CR10 functioned as a Cry3Bb synergist against coleopteran larvae."
