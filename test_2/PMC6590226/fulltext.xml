However, &#x0201c;all that glitters is not gold&#x0201d;&#x02014;one might interpret apparent patterns in the data as plausible even when the peak is a false positive. Accordingly, we sought to see how human annotators interpreted association results containing a mixture of peaks from both the original trait and a genetically uncorrelated &#x0201c;synthetic&#x0201d; trait. Two of us prepared a mix of original and synthetic peaks of three significance categories from five different scans along with relevant literature search results and then we all annotated these regions. Three annotators also scored the strength of evidence connecting each peak to the scanned trait and the likelihood of further studying that region. While annotators found original peaks to have stronger evidence (<italic>p</italic>

These results show that it is not difficult for annotators to make convincing connections between synthetic association signals and genes found in those regions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd id="gepi22189-kwd-0001">association peaks</kwd><kwd id="gepi22189-kwd-0002">false positives</kwd><kwd id="gepi22189-kwd-0003">genome&#x02010;wide association studies</kwd><kwd id="gepi22189-kwd-0004">literature review</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh</funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="4"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="5012"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>component-id</meta-name><meta-value>gepi22189</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>June 2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_NLMPMC version:5.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:24.06.2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><p content-type="self-citation">

However, further examination of the statistical results revealed that an error had been made in processing the data and the signal was entirely spurious. Such apparently convincing annotation of false&#x02010;positive results can mislead and misdirect researchers, leading to wasted resources, time, and money. However, spinning a convincing story appears to be easy for any region in the genome, whether or not there is a true signal there. For example, Ioannidis, Tarone, and McLaughlin (<xref rid="gepi22189-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) showed that 99% of early candidate genes identified for association with schizophrenia (SCZ) did not replicate using more powerful study designs. For the majority of these candidate gene studies, researchers were able, at the time of publication, to make convincing connections between these (likely) false positives and SCZ.</p><p>Our goal is to test if annotators of genome&#x02010;wide association study (GWAS) results are able to make convincing connections between given traits and &#x0201c;synthetic peaks,&#x0201d; loci wherein single&#x02010;nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for traits genetically uncorrelated with the traits annotators were asked to annotate for. To do this, two of us created mixtures of &#x0201c;original&#x0201d; peaks and &#x0201c;synthetic&#x0201d; peaks for multiple GWAS scans using summary statistics from previous consortia studies, assembling detailed plots of the significantly associated regions and literature search results for genes and SNPs found in these regions. Using these materials as well as other resources as desired, we all, acting as annotators, attempted to make connections between the scanned trait and the associated regions. We expected annotators would be able to make convincing connections between the traits and the genes for both the &#x0201c;original&#x0201d; peaks and the &#x0201c;synthetic&#x0201d; peaks. As far as we are aware, this is the first study of its kind.</p></sec><sec id="gepi22189-sec-0020"><label>2</label><title>METHODS</title><sec id="gepi22189-sec-0030"><label>2.1</label><title>Annotators</title><p>We (R.J.B. and D.E.W.) initially attempted to recruit annotators as coauthors, presenting this study at our fall 2017 departmental retreat to students, faculty, and colleagues. Interested annotators were provided with a handout that made them aware that for each trait, some of the peaks would be from a prior GWAS of a trait unrelated to the stated trait (Supporting Information S1 Text). Ultimately only three (A.E.S., D.L., and E.N.D.) submitted annotation; these three were completely blind to the source of the synthetic peaks. To increase the annotation pool, R.J.B. and D.E.W. also annotated scans. R.J.B was an M.S. in Human Genetics graduate student, D.E.W. is a Professor of Human Genetics and Biostatistics, and A.E.S was an M.P.H. in Epidemiology graduate student, D.L. is a Ph.D. in Human Genetics graduate student, and E.N.D. is a Ph.D. in Human Genetics graduate student.</p></sec><sec id="gepi22189-sec-0040"><label>2.2</label><title>Selection of traits</title><p>As we were interested in whether human annotators could find convincing connections between synthetic peaks and scanned GWAS traits, we selected traits that were not genetically correlated with each other. Using genetic correlation data from Bulik&#x02010;Sullivan et al. (<xref rid="gepi22189-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), we created genetically uncorrelated trait pairs with correlation &#x0003c;0.10, producing the following pairs: SCZ and low&#x02010;density lipoprotein (LDL); triglycerides (TG) and Crohn&#x02019;s disease (CD); high&#x02010;density lipoprotein (HDL) and ulcerative colitis (UC); and coronary artery disease (CAD) and Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD). We obtained GWAS summary statistics for these traits from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) for SCZ (Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, <xref rid="gepi22189-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), the Global Lipid Genetics Consortium for HDL, LDL, and TG (Willer et al., <xref rid="gepi22189-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), the Coronary Artery Disease (C4D) Genetics Consortium for CAD (The Coronary Artery Disease (C4D) Genetics Consortium, <xref rid="gepi22189-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), the International IBD Genetics Consortium for UC and CD (Liu et al., <xref rid="gepi22189-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), and the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project for AD (Lambert et al., <xref rid="gepi22189-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). We randomly selected which trait would be used as the scan trait and which trait would provide synthetic peaks. In doing so, LDL, CD, and UC were chosen to provide these synthetic peaks. To examine if trait selection in each pair made a difference in what genes and regions were selected as having convincing connections, CAD and AD were chosen to provide each other&#x02019;s respective synthetic peaks, with two annotators annotating for (CAD, AD) and one annotating for (AD, CAD), where the first trait provided original peaks and the second trait provided synthetic peaks. Our hypothesis is that annotators would still make convincing connections between synthetic peaks and the scanned trait but the genes and regions they identify as noteworthy may be different for CAD and AD.</p></sec><sec id="gepi22189-sec-0050"><label>2.3</label><title>Data cleaning and peak selection</title><p>We acquired summary statistics from the consortium websites and selected peaks with at least 500&#x02009;kb separating each locus. Three peak significance categories were established: (a) &#x0201c;highly significant&#x0201d; for peaks with a <italic>p</italic> value less than 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02013;15</sup>, (b) &#x0201c;moderately significant&#x0201d; for peaks with a <italic>p</italic> value between 5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> and 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02013;15</sup>, and (c) &#x0201c;suggestively significant&#x0201d; for peaks with a <italic>p</italic> value between 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> and 5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>. We excluded any peak SNPs with an imputation INFO score less than 0.90, and we excluded peak SNPs that were indel variants. We excluded peaks with minor allele frequency less than 0.05 except for SCZ, where a cutoff of 0.10 was used instead to match the methods used by the PGC (Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, <xref rid="gepi22189-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). For &#x0201c;highly significant&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;moderately significant&#x0201d; peaks, we excluded peaks that were not reported in the original studies. We did not do this for &#x0201c;suggestively significant&#x0201d; peaks because it is quite likely that suggestively significant peaks were not highlighted in the original studies. For each trait pair, nine peaks were selected, with one of each type of significance for the original trait and two for each type of significance for the synthetic peaks, excluding (AD, CAD) which had eight as there was only one &#x0201c;moderately significant&#x0201d; CAD peak available to be used as a synthetic peak. As we were primarily interested in the annotation of synthetic peaks and annotation time was a concern, we chose to have only one original trait peak for each significance category as opposed to two. Data cleaning and analysis were performed in R (R Core Team, <xref rid="gepi22189-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). We created regional association plots of each peak using LocusZoom with windows of 400&#x02009;kb and using the European hg19 build from the 1,000 Genomes Project to provide linkage disequilibrium (LD) information (Pruim et al., <xref rid="gepi22189-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="gepi22189-sec-0060"><label>2.4</label><title>Literature review and annotation of significant hits</title><p>We performed automated literature review searches of PubMed, PubMed Central, and Google Scholar using the R packages &#x0201c;RISmed,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;rvest,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;data.table&#x0201d; (Dowle, <xref rid="gepi22189-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Kovalchik, <xref rid="gepi22189-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Wickham, <xref rid="gepi22189-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Due to web&#x02010;scraping limitations, up to 1,000, 20, and 10 results, respectively, from each source, were obtained and recorded in spreadsheets. For each peak, our search query was the name of the peak SNP and the scanned trait, for example, &#x0201c;rs4393438 AND schizophrenia.&#x0201d; We also queried the name of genes within &#x000b1;50&#x02009;kb of the SNP or genes with at least one marker in LD with the peak SNP with an <italic>r</italic>
<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.2 and the scanned trait, for example, &#x0201c;RASA3 AND schizophrenia.&#x0201d;</p><p>The five authors, acting as annotators, used the provided literature search results and LocusZoom plots to annotate each peak within a scan as having convincing connections with the scanned trait or not and record the results within provided summary sheets. Annotators were free to carry out additional literature and database searches on their own. The provided summary sheets stated the scanned trait and were divided up into multiple pages containing LocusZoom plots of each selected peak region centered on the most significant SNP as well as space for the annotators to write a paragraph describing their annotation results. The instructions provided to the annotators can be seen in Supporting Information S1 Text. Three annotators were also asked to rate the strength of evidence for association with the scanned trait of a particular peak on a scale of 0&#x02013;3 with 0 being no evidence and 3 being very strong evidence. They were also asked to rate the likelihood of further study of those particular peaks on a scale of 0&#x02013;3 with 0 being no likelihood and 3 being a very high likelihood.</p></sec><sec id="gepi22189-sec-0070"><label>2.5</label><title>Analysis of annotation</title><p>Using the summary sheets filled out by the annotators, we recorded whether the annotators found a peak to have convincing connections with the scanned trait. To do this, we read the filled summary sheets and determined whether the annotators found connections based on what they had written. If the annotator explicitly stated that they found a connection, this was recorded as a convincing connection being made. If the annotator explicitly stated that they did not find a connection, this was recorded as no connection being made. If the annotator was not explicit in their response, the content of their report was more closely examined. If the annotator mentioned previous associations between the trait and loci, this was recorded as a convincing connection. As only three of the annotators were asked to rate the strength of evidence and likelihood of further study of each peak, we did not use these responses to determine whether a convincing connection was made or not.</p><p>To determine if there was an association between a peak being annotated as having convincing connections with the scanned trait and original/synthetic peak status, we performed Fisher's exact test for each individual annotator and Pearson's chi&#x02010;squared test for all annotators combined. We did the same for peak significance category. To determine if there was an association between peak significance category and strength of evidence of association and likelihood of further study, we performed the Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test for the three annotators who were asked to answer this and all three of these annotators combined. We also performed Wilcoxon rank&#x02010;sum tests for original/synthetic peak type and strength of evidence and likelihood of further study.

Of the six peaks that overlapped between the two sets, Annotator 1 found genes with convincing connections for (AD, CAD) that matched the genes Annotators 3 and 4 found for (CAD, AD). The SNP regions and their corresponding genes were rs10160170 (<italic>CXCL12</italic>), rs11218343 (<italic>SORL1</italic>), rs646776 (<italic>SORT1</italic>), rs1752684 (<italic>CR1</italic>), and rs4977574 (<italic>CDKN2A</italic>) (Supporting Information Table S2).</p></sec><sec id="gepi22189-sec-0090"><label>4</label><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>As far as we are aware, this is the first study to analyze annotators&#x02019; ability to interpret GWAS synthetic peaks. In this study, we have shown that, given literature search results and a mixture of original and synthetic association peaks for a scanned trait, annotators are able to make a large number of convincing connections between synthetic peaks and the scanned trait, with 55% of the synthetic peaks being annotated as having convincing connections (Table <xref rid="gepi22189-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2A</xref>). As might be expected, annotators had a higher likelihood of wanting to further study original peaks as well as finding original peaks as having greater strength of evidence compared to synthetic peaks.</p><p>We found that convincing connection status was significantly associated with both peak significance category and original/synthetic peak status (Tables <xref rid="gepi22189-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2A</xref>&#x02012;<xref rid="gepi22189-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">2C</xref>). This is as we expected as one would assume that more significantly associated peaks would have been studied further and, thus, have more evidence for annotators to find within the literature. In fact, multiple papers cited by the annotators also cited the GWAS from which the summary statistics were obtained. One would also make the fair assumption that peaks that have previously been found to be significantly associated with a trait should be annotated as having convincing connections more often than peaks that are less significant.</p><p>We found that original peaks had significantly different strengths of evidence and likelihood of further study compared with synthetic peaks, with original peaks having significantly more counts of having very strong evidence compared with synthetic peaks (Figure <xref rid="gepi22189-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This makes sense as one would expect original peaks to have more evidence connecting them to the scanned trait within the literature than the synthetic peaks. Polytomous multinomial logistic regression showed significant differences between highly significant peaks and suggestively significant peaks for no strength of evidence and very strong evidence. Again, this is as we would expect as suggestively significant peaks are more likely to be false positives than highly significant peaks and, thus, have less evidence supporting their connections to the scanned trait within the literature.</p><p>When comparing the annotation results of the (CAD, AD) and (AD, CAD) related sets, not only did the annotators find convincing connections between a majority of the synthetic peaks and the scanned trait, but the genes of interest they selected for the scanned trait matched those selected for the original trait for five of the six overlapping peaks (Supporting Information Table S2). One possible explanation is that CAD and AD are not as genetically uncorrelated as proposed by Bulik&#x02010;Sullivan et al. (<xref rid="gepi22189-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) (and more recently by Pickrell et al., <xref rid="gepi22189-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>), which could explain the matches seen at these peaks. For example, each of these five genes identified by the annotators is thought to be associated with inflammation, which may play a role in the development of both CAD and AD (Rea et al., <xref rid="gepi22189-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). <italic>CXCL12</italic> has been shown to be associated with neuroinflammation (Pappas et al., <xref rid="gepi22189-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), <italic>SORT1</italic> has been found to be associated with levels of progranulin, a protein which plays a role in inflammation during wound healing (Meeter et al., <xref rid="gepi22189-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>), <italic>CR1</italic> is a member of the complement receptor family which drives inflammation (Morgan &#x00026; Harris, <xref rid="gepi22189-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), cyclin&#x02010;dependent kinases, which may be inhibited by <italic>CDKN2A</italic>, a cyclin&#x02010;dependent kinase inhibitor, are involved in the regulation of inflammatory factors, and <italic>SORL1</italic> is associated with inflammatory intermediary molecules (Ogita et al., <xref rid="gepi22189-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). However, inflammation was not the primary reason annotators found these genes to be of interest (Supporting Information Table S2); they were merely one of the attributes contributing to some of their selections. If these genes are involved in multiple pathways and have multiple effects, this pleiotropy may make it easier for an annotator to discover a connection between a synthetic peak and the scanned trait.</p><p>There were multiple limitations of the study design which could have reduced our power and are worth discussing. First, there was a small number of annotators which may have limited our ability to detect some significant associations. Second, two of the annotators were not blind to the name of the synthetic traits. However, as the focus was on annotating the peak with respect to the stated trait, knowing the name of the synthetic trait had little bearing on whether or not there was annotation showing a convincing connection to the stated trait. Third, the annotation process used in this study may be more superficial than what is actually done in a real study and may be dependent on the background and expertise of the annotator. In this study, we asked annotators to look at literature search results, but in a real study, annotators are also likely to use other sources such as RegulomeDB and other online databases during the annotation process (Boyle et al., <xref rid="gepi22189-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Similarly, large research teams may collectively contain higher levels of annotation expertise than was applied here. As such, this study may not be as accurate a facsimile of annotation as possible. The fourth limitation is the subjective interpretation of whether a convincing connection was made or not. As mentioned earlier, determining whether a convincing connection was made depended on the paragraph written by the annotator. As the interpretation of these paragraphs is subjective, there may be discrepancies in what the annotator and the investigator considers a convincing connection; this could be addressed through the addition of more questions about the peak. Despite these limitations, we believe this represents an important first step in examining how easy it is to make convincing connections between a synthetic peak and the scanned trait.</p><p>It is important to remember that, if we were omniscient, we could design a study where all original peaks selected would be truly associated with the scanned trait and all synthetic peaks selected would be truly unassociated. This would allow us to analyze annotators&#x02019; ability to make convincing connections without worry that the connections they make are in fact real. Because we are not omniscient, there is no guarantee that the synthetic peaks are truly unassociated with the original trait. One way to improve synthetic peak selection might be to use the GWAS Catalog to select synthetic peaks that have not been found to be associated with the scanned trait (MacArthur et al., <xref rid="gepi22189-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). However, due to the interconnected nature of biology, we cannot be certain of the true nature of the peaks.</p></sec><sec id="gepi22189-sec-0100"><label>5</label><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>To analyze the ability of annotators to find convincing connections between false&#x02010;positive results and the scanned trait of a GWAS, we created synthetic peaks using summary statistics from GWAS of genetically uncorrelated traits and asked annotators to annotate a mix of original peaks and these synthetic peaks. We found that convincing connection status was significantly associated with both original/synthetic peak type and significance category. Annotators also found original peaks to have significantly stronger evidence than synthetic peaks and a significantly increased likelihood of further study, while significance category was significantly associated with the likelihood of further study. These results show that human annotators are easily able to make convincing connections between synthetic peaks and the scanned trait of a GWAS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Supporting information</p></caption><media xlink:href="GEPI-43-356-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Supporting information</p></caption><media xlink:href="GEPI-43-356-s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Supporting information</p></caption><media xlink:href="GEPI-43-356-s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Supporting information</p></caption><media xlink:href="GEPI-43-356-s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="gepi22189-sec-0110"><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This work is derived from Richard J.
