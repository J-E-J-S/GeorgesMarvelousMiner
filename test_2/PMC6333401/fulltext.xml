Persistent expression of the fetal &#x000df;-like globin, also known as &#x1d6fe;-globin, can ameliorate both disorders by serving in place of the adult &#x000df;-globin as a part of the fetal hemoglobin tetramer (HbF). Here we use CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to explore a potential &#x1d6fe;-globin silencer region upstream of the &#x003b4;-globin gene identified by comparison of naturally-occurring deletion mutations associated with up-regulated &#x1d6fe;-globin. We find that deletion of a 1.7 kb consensus element or select 350 bp sub-regions from bulk populations of cells increases levels of HbF. Screening of individual sgRNAs in one sub-region revealed three single guides that caused increases in &#x1d6fe;-globin expression. Deletion of the 1.7 kb region in HUDEP-2 clonal sublines, and in colonies derived from CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), does not cause significant up-regulation of &#x1d6fe;-globin. These data suggest that the 1.7 kb region is not an autonomous &#x1d6fe;-globin silencer, and thus by itself is not a suitable therapeutic target for gene editing treatment of &#x000df;-hemoglobinopathies.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000900</institution-id><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corn</surname><given-names>Jacob E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Li Ka Shing Foundation (HK)</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corn</surname><given-names>Jacob E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Heritage Medical Research Institute</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corn</surname><given-names>Jacob E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Thomas and Stacey Siebel Foundation (US)</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8784-0026</contrib-id><name><surname>DeWitt</surname><given-names>Mark A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>Lam Foundation</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1332-6301</contrib-id><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>Jennifer E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution>Jordan Family Foundation</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>David I.

SCD is a monogenic recessive disorder caused by a single-nucleotide mutation in <italic>HBB</italic>. SCD affects at least 90,000 predominantly African-American individuals in the US and millions more worldwide, predominantly in Africa and Southern India [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Even in the developed world individuals with SCD experience a greatly reduced quality of life, and suffer an ~30-year decrement in lifespan [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. &#x000df;-thalassemia is characterized by reduced or absent expression of HBB. The disease affects hundreds of thousands worldwide, with approximately 23,000 births annually in its most severe form, transfusion-dependent &#x000df;-thalassemia [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The disease is often managed with chronic blood transfusions, which eventually leads to iron overload requiring chelation therapy. Currently the only cure for both SCD and &#x000df;-thalassemia is allogeneic stem cell transplantation [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Both SCD and transfusion-dependent &#x000df;-thalassemia can be ameliorated by increased expression of &#x1d6fe;-globin. &#x1d6fe;-globin is a &#x000df;-like globin that, along with &#x003b1;-globin, comprises heterotetrametric fetal hemoglobin (HbF) [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. HbF inhibits polymerization of sickle hemoglobin (HbS), and levels of HbF above ~20% are associated with a virtual absence of manifestations of SCD and &#x000df;-thalassemia. Increased HbF in adults is a positive predictor of survival in patients with SCD [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In &#x000df;-thalassemia, expression of &#x1d6fe;-globincan replace the function of deficient &#x000df;-globin. Thus, methods to elevate expression &#x1d6fe;-globinare of considerable therapeutic interest.</p><p>CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene editing technology that enables efficient and facile genome manipulation via targeted generation of a double strand break (DSB) [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The break is repaired through either of two general pathways: error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), or accurate homology-directed repair (HDR) [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Targeting is directed by a 20 nucleotide guide RNA (gRNA) bound by Cas9 and a Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) within the genome [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The development of this modular, user-friendly targeting system has led to an explosion of interest in gene editing, including for the treatment of the hemoglobinopathies.</p><p>Strategies to drive -globin expression in erythroid cells via <italic>ex vivo</italic> gene editing of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) have recently emerged [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Decreased expression of <italic>BCL11A</italic>, which encodes transcription factor that is necessary for silencing of &#x1d6fe;-globin expression in adult-stage erythrocytes [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], leads to high-level expression of &#x1d6fe;-globin. Other efforts have targeted the &#x000df;-like globin locus, reproducing naturally occurring HPFH mutations in the promoters of the two &#x1d6fe;-globin genes, either through precise genome editing [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], or through NHEJ-mediated indel formation to disrupt transcription factor binding sites entirely [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>We used gene editing to explore a potential approach to create an HPFH phenotype. We compared naturally-occurring deletions causing either HPFH or &#x000df;-thalassemia identified a candidate 1.7 kb intergenic repressor region upstream of the <italic>HBD</italic> gene [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] (Figure a in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208237.s001">S1 File</xref>). We found that CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of this region and specific sub-regions induced expression of HbF in heterogeneous pools of HUDEP-2 cells. However, multiple clonal HUDEP-2 sublines harboring a deletion of the 1.7 kb region did not exhibit increased HbF. We also observed little up-regulation of &#x1d6fe;-globin expression when the deletions were made in CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), after differentiation into erythroid colonies and erythroblasts. These results suggest that this 1.7 kb region may contribute to developmental silencing of &#x1d6fe;-globin but is not an autonomous &#x1d6fe;-globin silencer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Defining a minimal <italic>HBG</italic>-<italic>HBD</italic> intergenic region associated with &#x1d6fe;-globin silencing</title><p>We began by examining breakpoints of naturally-occurring HPFH deletions to define a minimal region upstream of <italic>HBD</italic> whose deletion is associated with increased &#x1d6fe;-globin expression. Individuals lacking the intergenic region between the &#x003b4;-globin (<italic>HBD</italic>) and &#x1d6fe;-globin (<italic>HBG1</italic> and <italic>HBG2</italic>) genes exhibit an HPFH phenotype, in particular the 7.2 kb &#x0201c;Corfu&#x0201d; deletion [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and several more extended deletions including HPFH-1 and the French HPFH deletion [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In contrast, deletions that do not include this region are not associated with high HbF expression and instead cause &#x000df;-thalassemia [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Both HPFH deletion mutations and &#x000df;-thalassemia deletions include &#x000df;-globin. We hypothesized that these two effects, induction of &#x1d6fe;-globin and deletion of &#x000df;-globin, were spatially distinct and separable: deletion of regions associated with HPFH can independently up-regulate &#x1d6fe;-globin even in the presence of an intact &#x000df;-globin gene.

In an attempt to enhance deletion, we designed 150 nucleotide single strand oligonucleotide donors (ssODNs) for HDR. These ssODNs had one half matching 75 bp upstream of one breakpoint, and the other half matching 75 bp downstream of the other breakpoint, and thus corresponding to the sequence of a deleted allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208237.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, Table c in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208237.s001">S1 File</xref>). It is possible that these ssODNs may increase the likelihood that the dual DSBs generated by two RNPs are resolved in favor of a precise deletion, although this hypothesis was not tested in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208237.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). We evaluated guides by T7E1 digest of genomic DNA. Cultures of HUDEP-2 cells were treated with each pair and the appropriate stapler ssODN and then differentiated. Of each RNP/ssODN set, those programming deletion of regions 4 and 9 were associated with a significant increase in the frequency of HbF-positive cells by flow cytometry, increasing expression by 7% above the mean (of all cultures) for region 4, and 6.5% for region 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208237.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). RNPs that delete regions that overlap regions 4 and 9 also led to an increase in HbF-expressing cell frequency. Based on these observations, we focused our subsequent studies on region 4, which was the sub-region associated with the largest increase in fetal hemoglobin expression. Note that these screening studies did not definitively establish a link between deletion of any region and an increase in HbF expression.</p><p>Deletion of genomic elements using pairs of Cas9 RNPs is useful for defining regions of phenotypic interest. However, two DSBs in one targeted cell could be resolved to a variety of genotypes besides simple deletion: inversions, duplications, and short insertions or deletions at either cut site [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. To avoid these complications, a single cut site is preferred. Hence we attempted to identify a single gRNA within the PRR sub-region 4 that could induce a significant increase in HbF expression. We synthesized 20 Cas9 RNPs to target every wild-type Cas9 PAM within sub-region 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208237.g002">Fig 2D</xref> and Table c in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208237.s001">S1 File</xref>). We introduced each of these RNPs individually to HUDEP-2 cells by electroporation in biological triplicate. Gene editing by these RNPs was confirmed by T7 endonuclease I digest (Figure c in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208237.s001">S1 File</xref>). All but two RNPs (cutting at -5 and 21 bp from the 5&#x02019; breakpoint of region 4) led to indel formation within sub-region 4. and analyzed HbF using intracellular flow cytometry. After differentiation into erythrocytes, we found that three RNPs yielded modest but statistically significant increases in the frequency of HbF-expressing cells, when compared to a non-targeting control RNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208237.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Gene edited HUDEP-2 clonal cell lines lacking the PRR or two of its subregions do not consistently up-regulate HbF</title><p>We next sought to relate loss of one or more regions within the PRR to &#x1d6fe;-globin (and by extension HbF) expression. Our results suggested that the full PRR and discrete sites within it may be involved in silencing of &#x1d6fe;-globin in HUDEP-2 cells. However, a given RNP pair can generate many alleles: translocations, inversions, or indel mutations at either cut site. Results from gene-edited polyclonal pools cannot distinguish between these, and so do not clearly show whether a region is required for &#x1d6fe;-globin silencing. Indeed, we found evidence of short indel (but not inversion) genotypes when we used amplicon next generation sequencing (NGS) to genotype edited cell clones isolated from these pools (Table b in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208237.s001">S1 File</xref>), but did not find evidence of long deletions, as has been reported elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

Our results highlight significant clonal differences in HbF expression between sub-clones of HUDEP-2 cells, since H.21 is itself a sub-clone of HUDEP-2. Taken together, our data also suggest that sub-regions 4 and 9 of the PRR are not autonomous silencers of &#x1d6fe;-globin silencing in HUDEP-2 cells, since homozygous deletions of these regions leads to increased HbF expression in cell pools but variable expression between edited clonal cell lines.</p><sec id="sec006"><title>Deletion of PRR or two PRR sub-regions in erythroid colonies derived from CD34+ HSPC does not up-regulate HbF</title><p>Finally, we assessed whether some PRR or PRR sub-region deletion genotypes can alter &#x1d6fe;-globin expression in erythroid colonies derived from human primary CD34+ HSPCs.

In bulk populations of the HUDEP-2 polyclonal cell line we found that deletion of the PRR and smaller sub-regions led to &#x1d6fe;-globin re-expression. However, we found that edited HUDEP-2 clones or edited erythroid colonies derived from CD34+ HSPCs were not consistently associated with increased &#x1d6fe;-globin expression. Instead, we found marked heterogeneity in &#x1d6fe;-globin expression between clones (or clonal colonies) of the same genotype (and ultimately isolated from the same individual), including among wild-type sub-clones and clonal colonies. We conclude that deletion of the PRR alone is not sufficient for up-regulation of &#x1d6fe;-globin to therapeutic levels.</p><p>The possibility remains that the PRR cooperates with other regions within or downstream of HBB to mediate &#x1d6fe;-globin silencing. Previous studies have shown that deletions including both the PRR and all or part of &#x000df;-globin gene, along with other downstream elements, can induce &#x1d6fe;-globin [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this scenario, &#x1d6fe;-globin expression is dependent on <italic>both</italic> &#x000df;-globin loss and loss of the PRR. However the efficient induction of more extended deletions encompassing both the PRR and the &#x000df;-globin gene may be more challenging in a clinical setting.</p><p>The region containing the PRR was implicated in &#x1d6fe;-globin silencing on the basis of two lines of evidence. One was the comparison of multiple large deletions in the &#x000df;-globin locus: large deletions that do not include the PRR cause &#x000df;-thalassemia, while other deletions that do include this region confer a more benign HPFH phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The second was a ChIP-chip analysis that identified binding of Bcl11a within the PRR [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Bcl11a is well documented as a regulator of developmental &#x1d6fe;-globin silencing [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and so this result seemed consistent with the idea that the region was required for developmental silencing. However a more recent study that used an orthogonal method to map Bcl11a binding sites did not identify a binding within the PRR [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>The broad variation in HbF expression we observed between wildtype HUDEP-2 derived subclones and among wild-type erythroid colonies in HSPC suggests that &#x1d6fe;-globin expression level is prone to large spontaneous changes even in cell lines or colonies derived from cells with the same genotype. This suggests that caution should be used in interpreting selected results from HUDEP-2 subclones or HSPC colonies. It is not clear why this is the case, nor why there was a trend indicating that functional elements resided sub-regions 4 and 9 and their overlapping neighbors. Dual guide editing using Cas9 has the potential to generate complex genotypes, including inversions, although no inversions were seen in our NGS analysis [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; it is possible that a minority of these events had an outsize effect in edited pools of cells. A recent study suggested that large deletions and other rearrangements may occur following editing with a single guide, although we do not see direct evidence for this in our NGS analysis, which utilized a 2.5 kb PCR amplicon [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our investigation of clonal cell lines and clonal colonies focused on frank deletion genotypes, and it is possible that more complex genotypes led to &#x1d6fe;-globin re-expression in subsets within edited pools of cells, although we saw no evidence of these genotypes in our NGS data. Regardless, our study suggests that the PRR is not an autonomous &#x1d6fe;-globin silencer.</p><p>While this manuscript was in preparation a new study exploring deletions of larger genomic regions encompassing the PRR was reported using similar methods [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Interestingly, deletion of the 7.2 kb Corfu region or a 3.5 kb region that included the 1.7 kb PRR did not lead to significant fetal hemoglobin re-expression in HUDEP-2 cells. Instead a much larger 13.2 kb deletion that encompassed the adult &#x000df;-globin promotor did lead to robust &#x1d6fe;-globin expression. However, this large deletion also led to 3-fold drop in &#x000df;-globin expression, similar to the HPFH-1 deletion using CRISPR/Cas9 in HSPCs [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These results and others suggest that simultaneous deletion of the PRR and disruption of &#x000df;-globin expression may synergize to lead to high levels of &#x1d6fe;-globin re-expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>HUDEP-2 Cells and cell culture</title><p>HUDEP-2 cells were cultured and differentiated according to published protocols [<xref rid="pone.0208237.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], with the exception that doxycycline was included in <italic>both</italic> differentiation and expansion media.

Because ssDNA reduces viability when gene editing HSPCs, no &#x0201c;stapler&#x0201d; ssDNAs were used to edit HSPCs. For HSPCs, only synthetic sgRNA was used (Synthego, Inc.). HSPCs in P3 solution with RNP were electroporated using code ER100 on a Lonza 4d electroporator.

The globin transcripts listed above were mixed in known proportions that simulate relative transcript levels in erythrocytes (HBA-1: 0.7, HBA-2: 0.7, HBM: 0.01, HBB: 1.00, HBD: 0.04). HBG-1 and HBG-2 were varied between 0.005 and 0.10 to simulate the effect of varying levels of &#x1d6fe;-globin expression in a mixture.

The random sampling procedure was repeated 10 times for each mixture. For each alignment result, we calculated the mean ratio of observed over expected counts for each transcript, which we used as adjustment factors for the counts reported by kallisto after aligning real data; the difference in transcript counts before and after adjustment ranged from -1% to 0.5%.
