For eukaryotic cells, a large body of such data has been obtained from yeast strain collections (&#x0201c;libraries&#x0201d;) in which thousands of open-reading frames (ORFs) are systematically altered in identical ways, for example, by gene inactivation or over-expression to determine gene dosage phenotypes and genetic interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Likewise, gene tagging, for example with fluorescent protein reporters, has been used in functional genomics to study protein abundance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, localization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, turnover<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, or protein&#x02013;protein interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Due to their genewise construction, producing arrayed clone collections is typically time-consuming and cost-intensive. For yeast, this has been partly addressed with the development of SWAT libraries in which a generic N- or C-terminal tag can be systematically replaced with the desired reporter for tagging any ORF in the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, manipulation and screening of arrayed libraries remains dependent on special equipment to handle the strain collections and is confined to the genetic background of the yeast strain BY4741<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> in which most of these libraries were constructed. Therefore, arrayed libraries cannot address current and future demands in functional genomics that embrace the systematic analysis of complex traits or the comparison of different strains or species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">We imagine that a paradigm shift from arrayed to pooled library generation may offer a solution: experimentation with pooled biological resources is already well established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and the phenotype-to-genotype relationship can be inferred conveniently by genotyping phenotypically distinct subsets of pooled libraries using next-generation sequencing (NGS).</p><p id="Par6">To generate the pooled libraries rapidly and independent of their genetic background, an efficient strategy to introduce the genetic alterations is required. For example, RNA-programmable CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)-associated endonucleases have revolutionized the creation of pooled collections of gene activation and inactivation mutants in mammalian cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> since thousands of CRISPR guide RNAs (gRNAs) can be produced by cost-effective microarray-based oligonucleotide synthesis. In bacteria and yeast, strategies that exploit homologous recombination have enabled multiplexed gene editing by delivering short repair templates on the same oligonucleotides as the gRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> with applications for phenotypic profiling of genomic sequence variations.</p><p id="Par7">Because of high-throughput, low-cost, and broad host versatility, it is interesting to leverage these CRISPR-based methods beyond loss- or gain-of-function screens for the precise insertion of longer DNA constructs that deliver reporter molecules or tags to monitor the different cellular components encoded in the genome. Rapid access to such collections would synergize, for example, with image-activated cell sorting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, and enable to use subcellular localization as a criterion for cell sorting.</p><p id="Par8">To exert gene tagging in a pooled format, thousands of DNA constructs must be generated, each containing the reporter gene flanked with locus-specific homology arms and paired with a corresponding gRNA. However, parallel construction of thousands of such constructs is challenging.</p><p id="Par9">Here, we describe &#x0201c;CRISPR-assisted tag library engineering&#x0201d; (CASTLING) to create pooled collections of hundreds to thousands of yeast clones in a single reaction tube. All clones contain the same, large DNA construct (up to several kb in length) accurately inserted at a different, yet precisely specified chromosomal locus. CASTLING is compatible with microarray-based oligonucleotide synthesis since each insertion is specified by a single oligonucleotide only. Our method employs an intramolecular recombineering procedure that allows the conversion of oligonucleotide pools into pools of tagging cassettes.</p><p id="Par10">In this proof-of-concept study, we establish CASTLING in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> using gene tagging with fluorescent protein reporters as an example. We derive a set of rules to aid designing effective CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) for the CRISPR endonuclease Cas12a (formerly known as Cpf1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> for C-terminal tagging of genes in yeast, and determine parameters to maximize tagging success in libraries of different sizes. We use a simple assay based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to demonstrate how CASTLING libraries can be used for proteome profiling and ad hoc characterization of previously uncharacterized proteins, and provide a targeted NGS method for the quantitative analysis of such pooled experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Gene tagging with SICs</title><p id="Par11">The main component of CASTLING is a linear DNA construct that comprises multiple genetic elements: the &#x0201c;feature&#x0201d; for genomic integration such as a fluorescent protein tag, a selection marker, a gene for a locus-specific Cas12a crRNA and flanking homology arms to direct the genomic insertion of the DNA fragment by homologous recombination (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).

After individual transformation of the SICs and marker selection, we obtained 100&#x02013;1000 times more colonies from hosts that had transiently expressed a Cas12a endonuclease as compared to a host that did not (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Also, the presence of a crRNA gene specific for the target locus of the SIC was required (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), indicating that a functional crRNA transcribed from the linear DNA fragment promotes the integration of a SIC. Based on fluorescent colony counts, tagging fidelity had increased from 50 to 85% in the absence of Cas12a to 95&#x02013;98% when recombination was stimulated by the action of Cas12a (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).</p><p id="Par14">We also tested Cas12a endonucleases from other species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, finding that Cas12a from <italic>Acidaminococcus</italic> sp. <italic>BV3L6</italic> (AsCas12a) showed similar activity as FnCas12a (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a&#x02013;c</xref>). However, we continued with FnCas12a since it offered a broader genomic target space in the yeast genome than AsCas12a (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">Because of the high efficiency of SIC integration, we worried that multiple loci could be tagged within the same cell when different SICs were transformed as pools. We therefore transformed a mixture of two SICs, one to tag <italic>ENO2</italic> with mCherry and the other one to tag <italic>PDC1</italic> with sfGFP. We detected only a few individual colonies where both genes were fluorescently tagged (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), independent of the relative concentration of the two SICs used for transformation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Therefore, tagging multiple loci in the same cell would rarely occur if more than one SIC was transformed simultaneously.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Implementing CASTLING for pooled gene tagging</title><p id="Par16">To produce many different SICs in a pooled format using microarray-synthesized oligonucleotides, all gene-specific elements of a SIC, that is, the crRNA sequence and both homology arms, must be contained in a single oligonucleotide&#x02014;one for each target locus (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). In turn, this demands a strategy to convert these oligonucleotides in bulk into the corresponding SICs.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1)-assisted tag library engineering (CASTLING) in a nutshell. <bold>a</bold> For each target locus, a DNA oligonucleotide with site-specific homology arms (HAs) and a CRISPR spacer encoding a target-specific CRISPR RNAs (crRNA) is designed and synthesized as part of an oligonucleotide array. The resulting oligonucleotide pool is recombineered with a custom-tailored feature cassette into a pool of self-integrating cassettes (SICs). This results in a clone collection (library) that can be subjected to phenotypic screening and genotyping, for example, using Anchor-Seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. <bold>b</bold> The three-step recombineering procedure for SIC pool generation; details are given in the main text and Methods</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2019_10816_Fig2_HTML" id="d29e512"/></fig></p><p id="Par17">We implemented a three-step molecular recombineering procedure for this conversion that is executed in vitro (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a&#x02013;e</xref>). Its central intermediate is a circular DNA species formed by the oligonucleotides and a feature cassette. The feature cassette provides all the generic elements of the SIC, that is, the tag (e.g. green fluorescent protein (GFP)), the selection marker and an RNA polymerase III (Pol III) promoter to express the crRNA. The circular intermediates are then amplified by rolling&#x000a0;circle amplification (RCA) instead of PCR to avoid the formation of chimeras containing non-matching homology arms. The individual SICs are finally released by cleaving the DNA concatemer using a restriction site in between both homology arms.</p><p id="Par18">To accommodate all gene-specific elements on a single oligonucleotide, it was critical to use a Cas12a endonuclease because its crRNA consists of a comparably short direct repeat sequence (~20&#x02009;nt) that precedes each target-specific CRISPR spacer (~20&#x02009;nt; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5f</xref>). This arrangement allows the Pol III promoter, which drives crRNA expression, to remain part of the feature cassette, while the short Pol III terminator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> can be included in the oligonucleotide itself. This design leaves enough space for homology arms of sufficient length for homologous recombination (&#x0003e;28&#x02009;bp)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Adding up all the sequences, each oligonucleotide (160&#x02013;170&#x02009;nt) is within the length limits for commercial microarray-based synthesis.</p><p id="Par19">To select CRISPR targets near the desired chromosomal insertion points and to assist the design of the oligonucleotide sequences for microarray synthesis (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a&#x02013;d</xref>), we wrote the software tool castR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/knoplab/castR/tree/v1.0">https://github.com/knoplab/castR/tree/v1.0</ext-link>).

We designed 1577 oligonucleotides covering all suitable PAM sites within 30&#x02009;bp around the C-termini of the selected ORFs, yielding seven oligonucleotides per gene on average.

This loss in complexity was alleviated by the fact that multiple oligonucleotides were included per gene and we observed that more than 90% of the targeted genes were tagged in library 4a and 4b (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). We noticed that low abundant oligonucleotides after PCR amplification were prone to depletion during SIC preparation, accounting for the observed loss in sequence diversity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Across all preparations, copy numbers of individual oligonucleotides were highly correlated between duplicates after PCR (Pearson&#x02019;s correlation &#x0003e;0.96), but less between synthesis replicates (0.78&#x02013;0.90), and least for oligonucleotide pools obtained from different suppliers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). After recombineering and RCA, no significant correlation of SIC copy numbers was observed except for libraries 4a and 4b. A more detailed analysis indicated that 50% of the sequences exhibited a copy number change &#x0003e;2-fold during RCA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>), which could explain the loss of correlation between replicates after RCA. Taken together, these analyses identified the quality and amount of starting material and its recovery during recombineering as critical factors to preserve library diversity. Nevertheless, for a small library of 215 genes, CASTLING enabled tagging most of the selected genes within one library preparation.</p><p id="Par23">Next, we quantified tagging fidelity by fluorescence microscopy, which was possible because we had selected genes encoding proteins with validated nuclear localization: 90&#x02013;95% of the cells had a nuclear localized mNeonGreen signal in all libraries (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g, h</xref>). The remainder of the cells showed either no fluorescence (2&#x02013;8%) or a fluorescence signal elsewhere (0&#x02013;4%), usually in the cytoplasm with one exception (see below). So, nearly all genes must have been tagged in the correct reading frame.</p><p id="Par24">For the clones with no fluorescence signal, we suspected either frameshift mutations in the polypeptide linker (due to faulty oligonucleotides) or in the fluorescent protein reporter (due to limited fidelity of DNA polymerases), or off-target integration of the SIC. Sequencing of several insertion junctions of dark clones revealed small deletions of one or more nucleotides in the 5&#x02032;-homology arms that direct the SICs to the 3&#x02032; ends of the ORFs. Therefore, the majority of dark clones appeared to contain correctly targeted SICs in which mNeonGreen was not in frame due to errors in the sequences derived from the oligonucleotides.</p><p id="Par25">Next, we generated library-wide Anchor-Seq data encompassing the crRNA sequences and the 3&#x02032;-insertion junctions. This identified 280 instances in which the crRNA sequence and the genomic insertion site did not match. These off-target insertions corresponded to &#x0003c;0.2% of the clones. Most of them were single occurrences associated with 196 different SICs in total. Only 37 SICs showed off-target insertion at various genomic loci or in more than one library replicate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref>). It remains, however, unclear which of these insertions were caused by Cas12a-mediated cleavage at an off-target site and which were spontaneous chromosomal insertions.</p><p id="Par26">In addition to these events, we observed fluorescence signals at unexpected subcellular localizations. For example, 2% of the cells in library 2b displayed fluorescence at the spindle-pole body, which we attributed, based on Anchor-Seq, to a <italic>TEM1</italic>-mNeonGreen gene fusion. Indeed, on average 1.6% of all cells across all libraries had integrated SICs originally designed for another experiment in this study, which must have entered SIC or library preparation as a result of contamination.</p><p id="Par27">Together, these experiments demonstrate that in a pooled experiment CASTLING allows for highly efficient tagging of hundreds of genes with low levels of off-target insertion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Parameters affecting tagging success on a genome-wide scale</title><p id="Par28">Simultaneously with the small pool of nuclear proteins, we designed an oligonucleotide pool for C-terminal tagging of the yeast proteome.

Neither nucleosome occupancy of the PAM nor of the target sequence itself had a statistically significant impact on the tagging success in this library.

Based on our own experience<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, the construction of arrayed libraries depends on special equipment for parallelization of the procedures, it requires a (costly) resource of arrayed primers for PCR tagging, and handling thousands of strains keeps multiple researchers occupied for several months.</p><p id="Par43">In contrast, fewer resources must be committed to create a library by CASTLING. All the necessary oligonucleotides can be obtained from microarrays, which are about two orders of magnitude more cost-effective than a genome-wide set of conventional solid-phase-synthesized oligonucleotides. Once an established oligonucleotide pool is available, it can be reused to construct a variety of SIC pools containing different features, that is, tags or selection markers. The construction of SIC pools is rapid and can be completed within 1&#x02013;2 days since the CASTLING workflow avoids preparatory sub-cloning into a plasmid library, which is commonly used in other multiplexed gene-editing approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Transformation and growth of the yeast clones take another 2&#x02013;3 days, followed by recovery and analysis of the library. This makes library preparation by CASTLING very efficient and therefore it is possible to create a new library for each strain background or mutant of interest. Classical libraries in contrast are confined to the background they were made in and require genetic crossing to introduce a mutant, which depends on strains specifically constructed for these procedures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par44">In addition to the versatility and flexibility of library creation, tagging fidelity by CASTLING is 90% or higher, exceeding the fidelity observed in conventional gene tagging by PCR targeting, where routinely 50&#x02013;85% of the obtained clones are correct. It may be worth mentioning that elimination of the false clones during the construction of classical arrayed libraries remains one of the most laborious steps. With CASTLING, false clones cannot obstruct the correct interpretation of a screening because with Anchor-Seq all genotypes can be quantified that are present at the beginning of an experiment as well as their respective enrichment or depletion after phenotypic selection. This allows excluding erroneous genotypes while completing the analysis, which is typically not possible in other multiplexed CRISPR-based gene editing approaches that rely on indirect measures for genotype determination (e.g. sequencing the ectopic crRNA plasmids).</p><p id="Par45">A potential downside of CASTLING and many other pooled library approaches lies within the initial indeterminacy of the exact library composition: Each transformation will yield pools with not exactly the same composition. Currently, genotype coverage with CASTLING can exceed 90% when relatively small libraries with hundreds of genes are created and reproducibly reached 50% for libraries with thousands of genes using &#x0003c;10-fold oversampling (44,000 clones over 5940 ORFs). We have identified that SICs for which the CRISPR target site would be destroyed after integration, or SICs that had a GC-rich crRNA in its PAM-proximal dinucleotides, yielded higher clone numbers as compared to SICs lacking those features (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>).</p><p id="Par46">The identified parameters increased the likelihood of tagging success, but they might also reduce the number of clones for ORFs for which only less efficient SICs could be designed. In this case, additional oversampling would be required. Along this line, a better strategy to increase coverage might be to use successive rounds of CASTLING involving each time a new microarray to target the remainder of genes. The first array would target those genes that can be reproducibly tagged in all trials (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b, c</xref>), while subsequent arrays would incrementally complete the library with almost proportional scaling efforts in terms of clones to be collected. Probably, it would require 2&#x02013;4 rounds of CASTLING with a total of 60,000&#x02013;120,000 clones to tag &#x0003e;60&#x02013;90% of all 5500&#x02013;6000 genes in yeast. This would exceed available genome-wide tagging collection, for example, the C-GFP collection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> with 4159 ORFs (Thermo Fisher), the TAP-tag collection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> with 4247 ORFs (Dharmacon), or our tandem fluorescent timer collection with 4081 ORFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Importantly, such an optimization might be necessary only once. Afterwards, all oligonucleotide pools could be used in parallel to generate a nearly complete library. This approach might also yield optimized rule sets to guide the development of CASTLING for a different species.</p><p id="Par47">A major factor that decreased tagging success seemed to be oligonucleotide quality. CASTLING requires long oligonucleotides &#x0003e;100&#x02009;bp. Even very small error rates and almost perfect coupling efficiencies during oligonucleotide synthesis will give rise to pools that only contain a minor fraction of full-length error-free oligonucleotides. Furthermore, we observed that the same sequences synthesized in different batches gave rise to pools with different performance (pools B1 and B2). We have sequenced and thoroughly analyzed one of the oligonucleotide pools for large library creation. Only a fraction of the designed sequences was represented by perfect full-length oligonucleotides. Most frequently we observe deletions and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the oligonucleotide sequences. SNPs seem to be more frequent at the 3&#x02032; end of the oligonucleotide (which is synthesized first), whereas deletions become more frequent towards the 5&#x02032; end of the oligonucleotide (which is synthesized last). Indeed, error-free synthesis of long oligonucleotides remains challenging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. To increase the chance of representing each target locus by a perfect oligonucleotide, it might be beneficial to use as many different oligonucleotides per gene as possible or to include multiple redundant sequences.</p><p id="Par48">It is important to stress that faulty oligonucleotides do not necessarily impact the fidelity of the tagging because the in vitro recombineering steps and the in vivo recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> all select against faulty oligonucleotides. Also, errors in the crRNA will most likely render it inactive. Consequently, only a few oligonucleotides that end up in the genome are associated with frameshift errors that impair the expression of the tag. This is impressively demonstrated with the nuclear protein libraries that were prepared with three different oligonucleotide pools, all of which showing &#x0003e;90% in-frame tagging rates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>).

In our hands, 51&#x02009;s shearing time per tube, a peak incident power of 50&#x02009;W, a duty factor of 7%, and 200 cycles per burst robustly yielded the required size range. Adapters were prepared by combining 50&#x02009;&#x000b5;M of the respective Watson and Crick oligonucleotides (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Each mixture was heated up to 95&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 5&#x02009;min, followed by cooling to 23&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in a large water bath over the course of at least 30&#x02009;min. Annealed adapters were stored at &#x02013;20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C until use. We prepared an equimolar mixture of annealed adapters that contained either none, one, or two additional bases inserted after the UMI (halfY-Rd2-Watson and halfY-Rd2-NN-Crick) to increase heterogeneity of the sequencing library. The fragmented genomic DNA (55.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;L) were end repaired and dA tailed (NEBNext Ultra End Repair/dA-Tailing Module, New England Biolabs) and ligated to 1.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;L of the 25&#x02009;&#x000b5;M annealed adapter mix (NEBNext Ultra Ligation Module, New England Biolabs). Products larger than 400&#x02009;bp were purified by gel excision (using NuSieve, described above) and eluted in 50&#x02009;&#x000b5;L 5&#x02009;mM Tris-HCl (pH&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.5). SIC integration sites were enriched by PCR (NEBNext Ultra Q5 Master Mix, New England Biolabs) using 12&#x02009;&#x000b5;L of the eluate with suitable pairs of adapter- and SIC-specific primers. Initial denaturation was 98&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (30&#x02009;s), followed by 15 cycles of 98&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (10&#x02009;s), and 68&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (75&#x02009;s). Final extension was carried out at 65&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (5&#x02009;min). Reactions were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (0.9 vol, Beckman Coulter). The fragments were further enriched in a second PCR using the custom-designed primers Ill-ONP-P7-bi7NN and Ill-ONP-P5-bi5NN to introduce technical sequences necessary for multiplexed Illumina sequencing. After size selection by gel extraction (250&#x02013;600&#x02009;bp), NGS library concentrations were measured by Qubit Fluorometer (dsDNA HS Assay Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and by qPCR (NEBNext Library Quant, New England Biolabs, LightCycler 480, Roche). Furthermore, their size distribution was verified either on a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical Technologies Inc) or by gel electrophoresis of the qPCR product. Quantified libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq 500 (for pool C, Deep Sequencing Core Facility) or on a NextSeq 550 sequencing system (both Illumina, 300 cycle paired end). If necessary, 10&#x02013;15% phiX gDNA was spiked in to increase sequence complexity.</p><p id="Par74">For MinION nanopore sequencing, the first PCR was carried out as described above for library #1.1 (using 20 cycles) to introduce barcodes for multiplexing FACS bins on the same sequencing run, column purified, and the NGS library was prepared for 1D sequencing by ligation (SQK-LSK108) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocols (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Sequencing was performed on a MinION device using R9.4 chemistry (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Samples were multiplexed considering the number of different clones present in a pool, bin size, gDNA yield after extraction, and yield of the first PCR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Insertion junction sequencing of non-fluorescent cells</title><p id="Par75">Cells from library 1a were grown in selective synthetic media (SC with monosodium glutamate and hygromycin B) for approximately eight generations, and non-fluorescent cells were sorted into glass-bottom 384-microscopy plates using a FACS Aria III as described under &#x0201c;FACS&#x0201d;. The absence of fluorescence was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and 60 non-fluorescent clones were pooled and grown overnight to full density. Anchor-Seq amplicons were prepared as described under &#x0201c;Library characterization by Anchor-Seq&#x0201d; using primers NegCells-NNN (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). The amplicons were size selected (~600&#x02009;bp) and cloned using the NEB PCR Cloning Kit (New England Biolabs).

Read pairs were retained upon detection of basic Anchor-Seq adapter features. Next, these reads were aligned to a reference with all targeted loci using bowtie2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> v2.3.3.1. Such references comprised the constant sequence starting from the feature cassette amplified by PCR and 600&#x02009;bp of the respective proximal genomic sequence of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain S288C (R64-2-1). For off-target analysis, the constant Anchor-Seq adapter features were trimmed off the reads.

A read pair that aligned to the reference was counted if both reads of the pair were aligned, such that the forward read started at the constant region of the Anchor-Seq adapter-specific primers. In addition, we set the requirement that the inferred insert size was longer than the sequence provided for homologous recombination during the tagging reaction. Counting was implemented using a custom script (Python v3.6.3 with HTSeq 0.9.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> and pysam 0.13).

Therefore, the reference was assembled as aforementioned but using 2000&#x02009;bp of the locus-specific sequences plus the constant sequence of the cassette enriched by the Anhor-Seq reaction. MinION data were basecalled using the Albacore Sequencing Pipeline Software v2.0.2 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). For data analysis, a custom script was used to extract and de-multiplex informative sequence segments from all reads based on approximate matching of amplicon features (e.g., the constant region of the vectorette or feature cassette; Julia v0.6.0 with BioSequences v0.8.0, see above). Matching with a Levenshtein distance of 1 was sufficient to discriminate between the barcodes used in this study. Then, the extracted sequence segments were aligned to the reference using minimap2 (v2.2-r409)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>, using the default parameters (command line option: &#x0201c;-ax map-ont&#x0201d;) for mapping of long noisy genomic reads.
