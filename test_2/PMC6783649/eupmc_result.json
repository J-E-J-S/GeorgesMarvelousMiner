    "Cancer is a dreaded word, which has stimulated monumental efforts to discover and deliver effective cancer treatments for more than half a century. During the past two decades, our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of cancer has increased remarkably. This has fostered an explosion in the number of experimental agents and clinical trials coupled with a dramatic rise in the regulatory approval of therapies for human cancers. Unfortunately, our preclinical models perform poorly as predictive platforms for the ultimate success of clinical candidates, reflecting the complexity of cancer. Moreover the common combination of cancer drugs prescribes the need for a better understanding of the fundamental pharmacology of each agent. Here I briefly outline some of the fundamental changes that have and have not occurred in cancer pharmacology during the past two decades and prognosticate on possible future directions."
