While it occurs commonly among such isolates recent genotyping methods have shown that it is mostly confined to certain genotypes. Although pSLT plasmids are capable of self-transmissibility under experimental conditions their confinement to certain host genotypes suggests that in practice they are maintained by vertical rather than by horizontal transmission. This would imply that evolution of the pSLT plasmid proceeds in parallel with evolution of its host. The development of a phylogenetic evolutionary framework for genotypes of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium based on single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNPs) typing provided an opportunity to test whether the pSLT plasmid coevolves with its host genotype. Accordingly SNPs analysis was applied to the pSLT plasmids from 71 strains <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium of Australian and international origins representing most of the genotypes which commonly have a pSLT. The phylogenetic tree showed that pSLT sequences clustered into almost the same groups as the host chromosomes so that each pSLT genotype was associated with a single host genotype. A search for tandem repeats in pSLT plasmids showed that a 9 bp VNTR in the <italic>traD</italic> gene occurred in the pSLT from all isolates belonging to Clade II but not from isolates belonging to Clade I. Another 9 bp repeat occurred only in three Clade I genotypes with a recent common ancestor. The evidence relating to both of these VNTRs supports the proposition that the pSLT plasmid is only transmitted vertically. Some isolates belonging to one <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium genotype were found to have pSLTs which have lost a large block of genes when a resistance gene cassette has been acquired. Examples were found of pSLT plasmids which have recombined with other plasmids to form fusion plasmids sometimes with loss of some pSLT genes. In all cases the underlying genotype of the modified pSLT was the same as the genotype of regular pSLTs with the same host genotype implying that these changes have occurred within the host cell of the pSLT plasmid.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All raw sequencing data files are available from the European Nucleotide Archive database (project accession number PRJEB25063).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All raw sequencing data files are available from the European Nucleotide Archive database (project accession number PRJEB25063).</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The virulence plasmid of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium (<italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium), designated pSLT [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], is, in its most common form, a large, 94Kb, low-copy-number plasmid which belongs to the IncFII<sub>s</sub> plasmid incompatibility group [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and occurs commonly amongst isolates of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The plasmid has an 8-Kb region which encodes the <italic>spv</italic> genes thought to give a competitive advantage to the host by increasing the growth rate of the bacterium during the systemic phase of disease [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In its most common form it does not have any antimicrobial resistance genes but forms of pSLT with resistance genes such as pSal8934B (GenBank Acc. No. NC_019109), pSTU288-1 (NC_021155) and pSTMDT12_L (NC_016861) have been recorded.</p><p>The pSLT plasmid was first reported in 1970 [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] but it was not shown to be self-transmissible until 1999 [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Under optimal experimental conditions the pSLT plasmids of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium strains LT2 and 14028 were self-transmissible at a rate of 2.9 x 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> transconjugants/donor [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This was in the range reported for most natural self-transmissible plasmids of between 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> and 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A much lower rate of self-transmissibility (10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>) was found for strain SL1344 pSLT [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the case of SL1344 pSLT (NC_017720) it was shown that the low rate of transmission is due to a single C to T nucleotide mutation in the <italic>traG</italic> gene causing an A to V amino acid substitution in the TraG protein [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Conjugal transfer of pSLT from <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium strain ATCC 14028 to a Typhimurium strain lacking pSLT under natural conditions in the distal portion of the mouse small intestine has been demonstrated [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Despite this evidence the very limited host range of pSLT implies that conjugal transfer of pSLT is rare in practice. pSLT is not found in genera other than <italic>Salmonella</italic> and it is only found in serovar Typhimurium. Related virulence plasmids are found in eight <italic>Salmonella</italic> serovars including Paratyphi C, Enteritidis, Dublin, Gallinarum/Pullorum and Choleraesuis [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. All of these plasmids lack some of the genes of the <italic>tra</italic> operon and are consequently non-conjugative. They are therefore likely to be maintained by vertical rather than horizontal transmission. This was confirmed when it was shown that, with the exception of serovar Enteritidis, the virulence plasmids from the named serovars as well as from serovar Typhimurium have the same phylogenetic relationships as the host chromosomes. Plasmid pSENV from serovar Entertidis was shown to have been inherited horizontally because it was more similar to plasmids from more distantly related serovars Typhimurium, Choleraesuis and Paratyphi C than to those from the very closely related serovars Dublin and Gallinarum/Pullorum [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Genotyping of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium isolates by a combination of variable-number tandem repeats (VNTRs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) profiling called Repeats Typing has been used by Hiley et al 2014 [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] to recognise at least fifteen distinct genotypes. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) followed by core-genome single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) analysis has supported the separation of strains into the same genotypes and determined the likely relationships between genotypes [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Genotyping has shown that there is a distinct divide between genotypes likely to have pSLT and those unlikely to have it. Isolates belonging to ten genotypes nearly always have a pSLT indicated by the presence of a marker located on the pSLT, called STTR10pl, used in multi-locus-VNTR-analysis (MLVA) typing of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium isolates [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] while isolates belonging to five genotypes nearly always lack STTR10pl and presumably have no pSLT [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This strong association between genotype and possession or otherwise of pSLT plasmid infers that maintenance of pSLT in <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium is almost entirely dependent on vertical transmission rather than horizontal transmission. If the pSLT plasmid is almost totally confined to its host then it should be possible to show that its evolution follows a similar course to that of its host. In time the evolved forms of pSLT should become specific to the evolved genotype of its host. We have therefore applied SNPs analysis to investigate the phylogeny of pSLT plasmids within various genotypes of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium to determine whether pSLT co-evolves with its host or whether sequence variants of pSLT are randomly distributed across genotypes.</p><p>In addition to single-nucleotide mutations, evolution of a plasmid can occur as large-scale changes such as insertions, deletions, inversions and translocations often driven by mobile elements such as transposons and IS-elements [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. VNTRs can also arise in plasmids and may provide evidence of on-going evolution. We therefore compared repeat numbers for the genotypes which have a 9 bp VNTR located in the <italic>traD</italic> gene (PSLT104 in LT2 pSLT). Testing for VNTRs in pSLT allowed us to discover a new example of pSLT evolution caused by an insertion sequence (IS). We found that some isolates belonging to one genotype lacked the STTR10pl VNTR but they nevertheless had the 9 bp VNTR in the <italic>traD</italic> gene of pSLT. They were found to have a modified pSLT in which loss of genes (including the STTR10pl VNTR site), resulting from the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance genes involving IS<italic>26</italic>, has occurred. Another way plasmids have been shown to evolve is by recombination of plasmids to produce fusion plasmids [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We report examples of pSLT in fusion with plasmids belonging to other incompatibility groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec002"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="sec003"><title>SNPs analysis of pSLT plasmids in different host genotypes</title><p>Isolates were chosen to represent almost all of the genotypes which commonly have a pSLT plasmid. We chose 50 international and Australian isolates from the panel recruited for the comparative genomics of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium study of Fu et al 2017 [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215207.s001">S1 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215207.s003">S3 Table</xref>) as well as another 21 international and Australian isolates with pSLT plasmids and known genotype which have been sequenced as part of this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215207.s002">S2 Table</xref>). All these isolates belonged to Clades I and II because pSLT is almost always absent from Repeats Group 3 (RG3), RG5 and RG6 genotypes [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, S1 and S2 Figs] in Clades III, IV and V [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The pSLT phylogenetic tree showed clusters of pSLT sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215207.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) almost identical to the clusters of the corresponding Typhimurium host isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215207.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). There were no examples of pSLT plasmids from one host genotype locating close to plasmids which came from host genotypes more distantly related as happens with the horizontally acquired virulence plasmid pSENV in <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The inferred phylogenetic relationships between pSLT clusters were very similar to those for the host isolate clusters. For instance, the pSLTs and the host genomes for SARA4 and L1852 locate next to the clusters for RG12D and RG10. The host CRISPR profiles for these two isolates are a hybrid combination of RG12D CRISPR 1 and RG10 CRISPR 2 [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In another example, one of the three pSLT SNPs common only to isolates belonging to RG10, RG12D and RG13 clusters was the SNP identified in the <italic>traG</italic> gene of strain SL1344 (RG10) which greatly reduces the transmissibility of pSLT [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. With the exception of 15M662 belonging to RG12D all the pSLT sequences in these three clusters also had a 9 bp repeat present in SL1344 as reported below.</p><fig id="pone.0215207.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0215207.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p><bold>Maximum-likelihood phylogeny based on full length sequence SNPs analysis for 71 pSLT plasmids from Australian and international isolates of <italic>S</italic>.

We have examined the range of repeat numbers for a pSLT VNTR which occurs in all genotypes in Clade II with a pSLT but not in those in Clade I [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This is a 9 bp VNTR located in the <italic>traD</italic> gene, PSLT104 in LT2. Repeat numbers varied from 5 to 19 amongst 220 Queensland isolates genotyped by MLVA profiling. There were some distinct differences in the range of repeat numbers among the different genotypes (<xref rid="pone.0215207.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The highest number was seen in the RG4B genotype. The numbers in RG2 genotypes were usually higher than for RG9A and RG9B genotypes while in DT89 isolates belonging to RG4A genotype numbers were higher than for other members of RG4A. This seems to indicate that, for certain genotypes, there is a relationship between the number of repeats for this VNTR and the host genotype. Isolates in Clade I only ever had a single 9 bp sequence in their pSLT. We infer from this evidence that the pSLT plasmid has not undergone conjugative transfer between genotypes belonging to different clades. It may be that this pSLT VNTR only appeared in Clade II genotypes after Clade I split from a common ancestor for Clades I and II. This is a new observation which is supported by reports of other distinct differences between Clade I and Clade II genotypes in chromosomal VNTRs as well as CRISPR composition [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="pone.0215207.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0215207.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Number of isolates of <italic>S</italic>.

Typhimurium isolate is considered a proxy for the absence of the pSLT plasmid. It has been found that all or nearly all isolates belonging to a single genotype either have STTR10pl or it is absent. However for the RG2 genotype (to which LT2 belongs) we found 27 out of 93 isolates belonging to our local collection of DT141 or DT141 var 1 phage types lacked the STTR10pl VNTR. In the course of conducting tests for the 9 bp VNTR in <italic>traD</italic> gene of pSLT we found that eighteen out of twenty DT141/141 var 1 isolates without STTR10pl product had the 9 bp VNTR in the <italic>traD</italic> gene. Furthermore they nearly all exhibited resistance to ampicillin (AMP), streptomycin (STR) and sulphonamide (SUL) whereas most DT141/141 var 1 isolates with STTR10pl showed no antibiotic resistance. It was evident that the resistance profile of the DT141 isolates lacking the STTR10pl VNTR but with the 9 bp VNTR was linked to the VNTR profile (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> = 66.58, p &#x0003c; .01).</p><p>In order to elucidate further the status of the pSLT plasmid in DT141 isolates with the 9 bp VNTR in the <italic>traD</italic> gene but without the STTR10pl VNTR we selected primers to various genes around the LT2 pSLT genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215207.s004">S4 Table</xref>) including genes PSLT064 and 065 flanking the site of the STTR10pl VNTR and genes PSLT103 and 105 flanking the <italic>traD</italic> gene and conducted PCR testing on DT141 isolates with and without the STTR10pl VNTR. Isolates without STTR10pl differed from isolates with STTR10pl by failing to show PCR product for selected genes somewhere after PSLT052 and before PSLT105 indicating deletion of a large number of genes from the pSLT.

One was derived from isolate 15M663 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215207.s002">S2 Table</xref>) a sequenced strain of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium belonging to RG2 genotype isolated from a Danish patient in 2015 (Susanne Schjoerring, Statens Serum Institut, Denmark, personal communication). It was found to have very high sequence identity and coverage with pSTU288-1 (NC_021155), one of the plasmids found in <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium str. U288 isolated from a pig in the UK and described as a hybrid plasmid with pSLT genes coupled with horizontally-acquired elements and containing gene cassettes conferring resistance against a number of antibiotics and compounds [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This strain also belonged to RG2 and had an MLVA profile almost the same as the Danish strain we have sequenced. Closer investigation showed that both strains had most of the pSLT sequence of LT2 but were missing nt 30107&#x02013;36452 corresponding to genes PSLT040 to 045, including two of the virulence genes, <italic>spvA</italic> and <italic>spvR</italic>, and the sequence nt 19562&#x02013;30010 was inverted (relative to the rest of the pSLT sequence) adjacent to the larger of the resistance gene cassettes.

Typhimurium study of Fu et al, 2017 [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This strain was isolated from a human in the UK in 2002 and was shown to belong to the RG9B genotype. The plasmid had most of the LT2 pSLT plasmid but was missing LT2 pSLT genes PSLT020 to 026. Inserted just after PSLT019 was a sequence with 99% identity to the sequence nt 29968&#x02013;43819 in the IncI1 plasmid R64 barely overlapping with the R64 sequence in pSTU288-1 above. The insertion of the IncI1 genes therefore seems to have caused the deletion of the genes PSLT020 to 026. The L825 plasmid was almost identical to plasmids from six isolates of Typhimurium str. DT104 from Scotland isolated between 1990 and 1995 (Acc. Nos.

Examination of the CRISPR profiles of these isolates showed that although they were somewhat misassembled and not always complete they were much closer to the CRISPR profiles for RG9B genotypes than to RG8 genotypes to which DT104 isolates usually belong. Furthermore, the phage profiles of the DT104 isolates were the same as for L825 and another RG9B isolate L1849 [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] except that L825 lacked Gifsy-1. All these fusion plasmids showed that the pSLT component was closest in sequence to pSLTs belonging to hosts of the same genotype inferring that the plasmid fusion event has occurred inside the host carrying the pSLT.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec007"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrates the value of applying the data derived from whole genome sequencing of bacterial isolates towards the understanding of various aspects of plasmid evolution. Genetic characterisation of variants of the pSLT plasmid has provided evidence for co-evolution of pSLT plasmids and their <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium hosts for both Australian and international isolates. This supports the proposition that the pSLT plasmid is most likely confined to its host cell since we find no examples of the same pSLT genotype occurring in different host genotypes. As a consequence the pSLT sequences which constitute a pSLT genotype are derived from hosts which all belong to one <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium genotype. The study has also provided examples of pSLT plasmids showing large-scale changes under the influence of transposons or IS-elements as well as hybridisation with other plasmids to form fusion plasmids. The evidence indicates that these changes occur within the host cell of the pSLT and are maintained thereafter by vertical transmission.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Bacterial strains and sequencing methods</title><p>Raw sequence files for 43 international and Australian strains of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium with pSLT plasmids recruited for the comparative genomics study of Fu et al. 2017 [<xref rid="pone.0215207.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] were downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena</ext-link>) as in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215207.s001">S1 Table</xref>.
