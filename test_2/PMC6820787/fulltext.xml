Previously, we showed that unlike astrocytes, glioblastoma cells do not downregulate cholesterol synthesis when plated at high density. In this report, we show that high cell density induces ABCA1 expression in glioblastoma cells, enabling them to get rid of excess cholesterol generated by an activated cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Because oxysterols are agonists for Liver X Receptors (LXRs), we investigated whether increased cholesterol activates LXRs to maintain cholesterol homeostasis in highly-dense glioblastoma cells. We observed that dense cells had increased oxysterols, which activated LXR&#x003b2; to upregulate ABCA1. Cells with CRISPR-mediated knockdown of LXR&#x003b2;, but not ABCA1, had decreased cell cycle progression and cell survival, and decreased feedback repression of the mevalonate pathway in densely-plated glioma cells. LXR&#x003b2; gene expression poorly correlates with ABCA1 in glioblastoma patients, and expression of each gene correlates with poor patient prognosis in different prognostic subtypes. Finally, gene expression and lipidomics analyses cells revealed that LXR&#x003b2; regulates the expression of immune response gene sets and lipids known to be involved in immune modulation. Thus, therapeutic targeting of LXR&#x003b2; in glioblastoma might be effective through diverse mechanisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>CNS cancer</kwd><kwd>Lipid signalling</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>US National Cancer Institute Center for Cancer Research (NCI-CCR) Intramural Research Program</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Glioblastoma, or GBM, is the most common malignant primary brain tumor and among the most lethal of all cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. GBM has a median survival of 15 months with current standard of care therapy, which includes radiation, surgery, and temozolomide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Because of the invasive nature of GBM, the entire tumor cannot be removed surgically. The Cancer Genomic Atlas (TCGA) project has revealed interesting insights regarding genes and pathways that are altered in GBM, such as the RTK/PI3K/MAPK (90%), p53 (86%), Rb pathways (79%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Despite the prevalence of &#x0201c;druggable&#x0201d; target alterations in GBM, small molecule therapies have yet to make any inroads into this disease. There are multiple possible reasons for the failure of these therapies such as pathway redundancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, genomic heterogeneity between tumor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and preventive effects of the blood brain barrier. These complications call for better understanding of the biology of these tumors to find novel therapies.</p><p id="Par3">Contact inhibition is a key process in the transformation of normal cells to malignancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Normal cells use contact inhibition to maintain tissue homeostasis in the body. In contrast, cancer cells are unable to arrest proliferation at confluence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In fact, loss of contact inhibition that leads to uncontrolled proliferation is used as an <italic>in vivo</italic> prognostic factor in human cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Cancer cells grown at high density are resistant to a diverse array of cytotoxic cancer therapeutics such as anthracyclines, antibiotics, vinca alkaloids, taxanes, nitrosureas and bleomycin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In normal cells, cell-cell contact negatively affects growth factor-mediated intracellular signaling pathways, such as ERK and Akt, to suppress cell cycle progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Besides its role in promoting cell division, Akt activity also leads to transcription of the enzymes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis via the <underline>s</underline>terol <underline>r</underline>egulatory <underline>e</underline>lement-<underline>b</underline>inding <underline>p</underline>rotein (SREBP) transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, both critical components of membranes and signaling pathways needed to maintain growth and proliferation. The regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by cell density is dysregulated in glioblastoma: at high cell density, normal astrocytes turn off cholesterol synthesis and reduce the levels of cholesterol while glioblastoma cells ignore density-dependent regulation and maintain cholesterol synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Cholesterol is an important nutrient for normal cell function and viability. It plays a critical role in the plasma membrane and lipid rafts and act as a precursor for steroid hormones, bile acids, and Vitamin D. In the brain, cholesterol is synthesized locally because exogeneous cholesterol cannot cross the blood brain barrier. In the central nervous system, cholesterol synthesis and clearance are regulated to create a tightly coupled homeostatic system that allows a modest amount of cholesterol turnover while keeping the overall levels consistent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Cholesterol metabolism in mammals is regulated through the coordinated actions of SREBP and <underline>L</underline>iver <underline>X R</underline>eceptor (LXR) transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. SREBPs induce the genes associated with cholesterol biosynthesis and enhance the uptake of extracellular cholesterol by induction of <underline>L</underline>ow-<underline>D</underline>ensity <underline>L</underline>ipoprotein <underline>R</underline>eceptors (LDLRs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

LXRs also down-regulate the uptake of cholesterol by inducing the synthesis of IDOL (<underline>I</underline>nducible <underline>D</underline>egrader of <underline>L</underline>DLR), which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates the degradation of LDLR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. An LXR&#x003b1; binding site in the proximal promoter region of the rat 7A-hydroxylase CYP7A also promotes the removal of cholesterol by increasing its conversion to bile acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Under physiologic conditions, oxysterols such as 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, and 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, strongly induce LXR&#x003b1; and LXR&#x003b2; transcriptional targets but not other sterols (lanosterol, desmosterol, steroid hormone precursors, testosterone, progesterone, or bile acids)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. 24-OHC, the most abundant oxysterol in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, is generated by hydroxylation of cholesterol in neurons by the cytochrome P450 enzyme cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) and gets cleared in an ABCA1-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. It subsequently crosses the blood-brain barrier by passive diffusion across membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.

LXR-623 was shown to target GBM by lowering cellular cholesterol content through the upregulation of the cholesterol efflux transporter, ABCA1, thus disrupting cholesterol homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Because we previously found that <italic>de novo</italic> cholesterol synthesis is upregulated in patient-derived glioma tumor neurospheres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, we explored below the hypothesis that inhibiting LXR-mediated cholesterol homeostasis might increase cholesterol levels to lethal levels in glioma cells. We found that LXR&#x003b2; enables glioma cells to proliferate and survive at high cell densities when cholesterol is high and represses feedback through the mevalonate pathway. Interestingly, this did not appear to work solely through its major downstream effector ABCA1, as CRISPR-mediated knockdown of this gene did not recapitulate the cellular phenotypes observed with knockdown of LXR&#x003b2;. In the glioma tumor initiating cells, LXR&#x003b2; activated transcription of <italic>ABCA1</italic>, but also immune modulation pathways and the production of glycerophospholipids.

In our previous work, we found that glioma cells constitutively express the mevalonate pathway and keep cholesterol levels high at high cell densities. In contrast, normal human astrocytes (NHAs) significantly downregulate genes in the mevalonate pathway and decrease total cellular cholesterol when grown to high cell density and contact-inhibited (see ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). We were interested in exploring the impact of dysregulated cholesterol synthesis on glioma cell biology. We first examined gene expression profiles from patient-derived primary glioma tumor neurosphere cells (TS543, TS576, TS600, and TS616) and NHAs plated at low and high density.
