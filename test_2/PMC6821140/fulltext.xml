Whole genome resequencing of 197 <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> isolates collected from spring, durum, and winter wheat production regions of the United States enabled the examination of effector diversity and genomic regions under selection specific to geographically discrete populations. 1,026,859 SNPs/InDels were used to identify novel loci, as well as <italic>SnToxA</italic> and <italic>SnTox3</italic> as factors in disease. Genes displaying presence/absence variation, predicted effector genes, and genes localized on an accessory chromosome had significantly higher pN/pS ratios, indicating a higher rate of sequence evolution. Population structure analyses indicated two <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> populations corresponding to the Upper Midwest (Population 1) and Southern/Eastern United States (Population 2). Prevalence of <italic>SnToxA</italic> varied greatly between the two populations which correlated with presence of the host sensitivity gene <italic>Tsn1</italic> in the most prevalent cultivars in the corresponding regions. Additionally, 12 and 5 candidate effector genes were observed to be under diversifying selection among isolates from Population 1 and 2, respectively, but under purifying selection or neutrally evolving in the opposite population. Selective sweep analysis revealed 10 and 19 regions that had recently undergone positive selection in Population 1 and 2, respectively, involving 92 genes in total. When comparing genes with and without presence/absence variation, those genes exhibiting this variation were significantly closer to transposable elements. Taken together, these results indicate that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> is rapidly adapting to distinct selection pressures unique to spring and winter wheat production regions by rapid adaptive evolution and various routes of genomic diversification, potentially facilitated through transposable element activity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p><italic>Parastagonospora nodorum</italic> is an economically important pathogen of wheat, employing proteinaceous effectors to cause disease. Recognition of effectors by host susceptibility genes often leads to the elicitation of programmed cell death. However, little is known on the correlation between effector diversity and the spatial distribution of host resistance/susceptibility or the genomic mechanisms of diversification. This research presents the genome resequencing of 197 <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> isolates collected from spring, winter, and durum wheat production regions of the United States, enabling the investigation of genome dynamics and evolution. Results illustrate local adaptation to host resistance or susceptibility, as evidenced by population-specific evolution of predicted effector genes and positively selected selective sweeps. Predicted effector genes, genes exhibiting presence/absence variation, and genes residing on an accessory chromosome, were found to be diversifying more rapidly. Additionally, transposable elements were predicted to play a role in the maintenance or elimination of genes.

The dynamic nature of fungal genomes, resulting in small and large-scale changes, provides diversification while maintaining essential functions. The prevalence of mobile elements often drives this flexibility, resulting in the creation, abolition, or translocation of genes [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Additionally, this activity of mobile elements significantly contributes to the diversification of asexually reproducing fungal pathogens through the rearrangement of chromosomes into lineage specific segments [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This phenomenon has recently been described as a compartmentalized &#x02018;two-speed&#x02019; genome, consisting of regions of high gene density and equilibrated GC content, as well as a gene-sparse compartment [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The regions of low gene density and high repetitive content appear to be hotbeds of rapid evolution, harboring genes encoding virulence determinants known as effectors that manipulate host cellular processes to facilitate infection [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, not all plant pathogenic fungi possess rigidly defined regions of low or high GC content; rather, they may have rapidly evolving genes and transposable elements dispersed evenly throughout the genome [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Fungal effector molecules act to modulate the host defense response in various ways, typically dependent on the lifestyle of the pathogen. Pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as the major fungal cell wall constituent chitin, may be recognized by the host and trigger an early defense response known as PAMP triggered immunity (PTI) [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Effectors can successfully subvert this response to permit infection. Ecp6, a fungal effector from <italic>Cladosporium fulvum</italic>, binds chitin and prevents the initiation of PTI [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the context of a biotrophic pathogen, host plants subsequently evolved the means to recognize virulence effectors, triggering a hypersensitive response and sequestration of the pathogen. Recognition is often mediated by host resistance genes in the nucleotide binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) gene family [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Within many biotrophic pathosystems, this interaction between a dominant host resistance gene and a biotrophic effector follows the gene-for-gene model [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, necrotrophic pathogens use effectors to exploit the same host defense cellular machinery. Occurring in an inverse gene-for-gene manner, effectors are recognized by dominant host susceptibility genes, resulting in necrotrophic effector triggered susceptibility [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The lack of homology or conserved domains between effector proteins hinders efforts at novel effector discovery. This lack of similarity can be attributed to the rapid evolution in response to local selection pressure exerted by host resistance or susceptibility. However, the problem can be remedied via thorough genomic and genetic analyses.</p><p>Rapid evolution and positive selection of pathogen effector genes, as well as the host resistance/susceptibility genes, drive antagonistic co-evolutionary processes in plant-pathogen systems. The detection of positive selection permits the identification of genes potentially involved in local adaptation to host genotypes or environmental pressures [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Examination and comparison of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates within genes has been used to detect evidence of purifying, neutral, or positive selection of putative pathogen virulence genes [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. More recently, population whole-genome sequencing data has been leveraged to identify and compare selective sweep regions between pathogen populations, as well as closely related species, resulting from strong selection of a particular allele. The signature of such strong selection in population data is a genomic region devoid of genetic variation, and thus termed a selective sweep region. Badouin et al. [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] found a greater prevalence of selective sweeps in <italic>Microbotryum lychnidis-dioicae</italic> compared to its sister species <italic>Microbotryum silenes-dioicae</italic>. Additionally, candidate genes potentially involved in pathogenicity and host adaptation, as well as genes upregulated <italic>in planta</italic>, were identified within selective sweep regions. Analysis of a global collection of the barley pathogen <italic>Rhynchosporium commune</italic> identified three major genetic clusters that exhibited unique and generally non-overlapping selective sweep regions hypothesized to stem from ecological variations [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Interestingly, genes potentially implicated in response to abiotic stress and not host adaptation were found to be enriched within selective sweep regions. Similarly, evidence for selective sweeps was detected in a worldwide collection of <italic>Zymoseptoria tritici</italic>, with the majority of the identified regions being unique to one of the four postulated populations [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, in this case, genes typically associated with pathogenicity or virulence, such as secreted proteins or cell wall degrading enzymes, were found to underlie selective sweeps. These studies revealed how selection pressures differing between local populations or species lead to the positive selection of genomic regions, providing evidence for local adaptation. The identification of sweep regions can lead to the identification of genes co-localizing with the sweeps, aiding the formation of hypotheses on niche adaptation.</p><p>Globally, wheat ranks as one of the most widely grown crops and supplies humans with an important source of calories. In 2017, approximately 218.5 million hectares were harvested globally [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Common wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>), an allohexaploid (AABBDD), is classified by several characteristics including growth habit (spring or winter), bran color (red or white), and hardness of endosperm (soft or hard). Hard red spring wheat and hard red winter wheat are utilized primarily in the bread making industry, whereas flour from soft red winter wheat is often used for pastries and crackers [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Durum wheat (<italic>Triticum turgidum</italic> var. <italic>durum</italic>), an allotetraploid (AABB), is primarily used in the pasta industry [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Hard red spring wheat and durum wheat are typically grown in the Upper Midwest, hard red winter wheat is typically grown in the Great Plains, and soft red winter wheat cultivation predominates in the eastern United States [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As all classes of wheat are threatened by disease epidemics on an annual basis, investigation of the evolutionary mechanisms of adaptation in important wheat pathogens is of upmost importance to protect the production of this important global commodity.</p><p><italic>Parastagonospora nodorum</italic>, a haploid, necrotrophic fungal pathogen of both common wheat and durum wheat, causes significant yield losses and is an annual threat to global wheat production [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This pathogen has also emerged as a model organism for the study of plant-necrotrophic specialist interactions. Genomic resources, including the development of near complete reference genomes of diverse isolates bolstered by deep RNA sequencing, have greatly aided the investigation of pathogen virulence. Initially, the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> Australian isolate SN15 was sequenced with Sanger sequencing and subsequently improved via re-sequencing with short-read Illumina technology, RNA-seq data, and protein datasets [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

Additionally, a high level of genotypic diversity enabled robust genome-wide association analyses, which identified <italic>SnToxA</italic> and <italic>SnTox3</italic> as being significantly associated with disease severity on both spring and winter wheat lines.

Genes present in all isolates were a median distance of 13.3 kb away from the nearest repetitive element, while genes exhibiting PAV were significantly closer, being only a median distance of 5.8 kb away (Pairwise Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, p &#x0003c; 2.0 x 10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008223.g008">Fig 8</xref>).

Until recently, effector biology and genome research within <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> has relied on relatively few genomic resources. Complementing the recently refined SN15 genome [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and the establishment of nearly complete telomere-to-telomere reference genomes of three additional <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> isolates [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], this research enhances our knowledge of genomic diversity within <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> by revealing locale-specific effector diversification and evidence of host susceptibility genes influencing population structure. Due to the previous identification of the SnToxA effector, as well as characterization of the host susceptibility gene <italic>Tsn1</italic>, we were able to demonstrate the direct impact of the effector-host interaction on pathogen population allele frequencies and signatures of positive selection. This investigation also gives insight into the classes of genes undergoing diversifying selection through the accumulation of nonsynonymous SNPs, LOF mutations, and PAV, as well as identifying repetitive elements as a contributing factor to this diversification. Additionally, the results illustrate the utility of these data for association mapping strategies using linkage disequilibrium surrounding effector loci.</p><sec id="sec014"><title>Population structure and genetic diversity</title><p>Population structure analyses clearly separated the natural population of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> isolates into two populations corresponding to geographic region. Due to the expansive region in which isolates belonging to Population 2 were collected compared to the three-state region giving rise to isolates from Population 1, we originally postulated that Population 2 would have higher levels of genetic diversity. However, a greater number of genic SNPs, both synonymous and nonsynonymous, were observed in Population 1 compared to Population 2. This disparity is also evidenced in the estimated &#x003c0; values for each population. One possible explanation is the age of the populations. If the United States <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> population originated in the Upper Midwest and subsequently spread to the other wheat producing regions, more genome variants might have accumulated over time. Population size may also play a role in the observed differences and account for the increased level of nucleotide diversity observed in Population 1. Isolates in Population 2 may have recently experienced a bottleneck, resulting in a lower genome-wide Tajima&#x02019;s D compared to Population 1, as well as the identification of a larger number of potential selective sweep regions. Alternatively, differences may exist in the amount of selection pressure being placed on genes within each population. In the Upper Midwest, hard red spring, hard red winter, and durum wheat are cultivated, whereas predominantly just a single market class, soft red winter wheat, is grown in the Southern/Eastern United States. Additionally, it has been shown that differences exist in the presence of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> sensitivity genes between wheat germplasm in the Midwest and the South and Eastern United States [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. If the genetic basis of host sensitivity of wheat grown in the Southern/Eastern United States is more uniform, with less variability in susceptibility genes present in the winter wheat cultivars grown, selection pressure may have a reduced effect on the genic variation of isolates collected from winter wheat regions. Conversely, with three wheat classes being grown in the Upper Midwest, the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> population may have been exposed to a diverse range of host resistance/susceptibility genes, therefore driving stronger genic variation.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Distribution and diversity of <italic>SnToxA</italic>, <italic>SnTox1</italic>, and <italic>SnTox3</italic></title><p>A large difference was observed in the distribution of <italic>SnToxA</italic> among <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> isolates. Only 4.3% of isolates from Population 1 had lost <italic>SnToxA</italic>, compared to the 93.8% of isolates from Population 2 that lacked the gene (<xref rid="pgen.1008223.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Additionally, a selective sweep was detected in the genomic region flanking <italic>SnToxA</italic> specifically in Population 1, but not in Population 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008223.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). This dramatic difference in the prevalence of <italic>SnToxA</italic> is likely correlated with the absence of <italic>Tsn1</italic>, the dominant susceptibility gene that indirectly recognizes SnToxA, from the winter wheat cultivars planted in the soft red winter wheat region of the United States where most of Population 2 was collected. Previous research investigated the sensitivity of winter wheat breeding lines planted in the regions where isolates from the natural population were collected, particularly Georgia, Maryland, and North Carolina. Except for a single line from the breeding program at the USDA-ARS, Raleigh, North Carolina, all breeding lines from the regions were found to be insensitive to infiltrations of SnToxA, and therefore, lacked a functional <italic>Tsn1</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Conversely, previous research identified SnToxA sensitivity present in popular North Dakota spring wheat cultivars Glenn and Steele ND [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Additionally, <italic>Tsn1</italic> is present in the vast majority of wheat cultivars planted in Oklahoma [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The strong selective advantage given by SnToxA in the presence of a functional <italic>Tsn1</italic> explains the abundance of isolates harboring <italic>SnToxA</italic> in Oklahoma and the Upper Midwest. As <italic>Tsn1</italic> is fairly rare in the eastern winter wheat producing regions of the United States, the <italic>SnToxA</italic> gene was lost. A study by McDonald et al. [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] found <italic>SnToxA</italic> to be present in only 25% of a North American <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> population, compared to an overall presence of 63.4% in the present study population. The large difference between these two studies is probably due to differences in the number of isolates used from the Upper Midwest and the rest of the United States. Previously, approximately 8% of the isolates used were from North Dakota, with the remaining isolates originating in winter wheat producing regions [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], compared to the population used in coverage analysis in this study, consisting of 59.5% of the isolates collected in the Upper Midwest where <italic>Tsn1</italic> is prevalent. The results from this study illustrate the powerful selection pressure placed on pathogen populations by the deployment of a single host susceptibility gene for the maintenance of the corresponding effector. Additionally, these results suggest that in the absence of the host susceptibility gene <italic>Tsn1</italic> in regional wheat cultivars, the presence of <italic>SnToxA</italic> may incur a fitness cost for the pathogen.</p><p><italic>SnTox1</italic> was the most prevalent <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> effector found within this natural population, being present in 95.4% of the isolates (<xref rid="pgen.1008223.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). This frequency was higher than that observed in a North American population by McDonald et al. [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], where it was found to be present in 70% of isolates examined, as well as in 84% of a global population. However, like the study by McDonald et al. [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], <italic>SnTox1</italic> was found to be the most widespread effector of the three characterized genes. Additionally, we detected nine unique haplotypes for <italic>SnTox1</italic> compared to the two private haplotypes previously detected in a North American population [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The wide-range distribution of <italic>SnTox1</italic> is likely due to its dual function in chitin binding and protection from wheat chitinases [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The ability of SnTox1 to trigger programmed cell death via recognition by Snn1 is a strong selective force [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] but is dependent on the presence/absence of <italic>Snn1</italic> in locally grown wheat cultivars. The more broad-range effector function of chitinase protection provided by SnTox1 likely explains its relatively high prevalence compared to the other necrotrophic effectors.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Effector diversification and selective sweeps are population dependent</title><p>Plant-pathogenic fungi are constantly adapting the way they infect their host, often using a suite of effectors to facilitate disease. These effectors are typically small, secreted proteins that lack known functional domains. Additionally, they may be cysteine-rich and exhibit signatures of diversifying selection [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Overall, the identified putative effectors in the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> genome exemplify these hallmarks, as evidenced by the accumulation of significantly more non-synonymous changes compared to secreted non-effectors or non-secreted proteins. Additionally, 72.4% of predicted effector proteins lacked apparent functional domains. Interestingly, not only are effectors diversifying within the entire population, but effector diversification was also observed to occur within specific subpopulations. Previous studies have identified allelic differences between populations in functionally validated effector loci. Significant population structure was observed at the <italic>AvrP123</italic> and <italic>AvrP4</italic> loci between regions and local populations in <italic>Melampspora lini</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. These differences were hypothesized to result from distinct interactions with local host populations. Brunner and McDonald [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] identified 30 isoforms of the effector AvrStb6 from <italic>Zymoseptoria tritici</italic>, with 27 isoforms being specific to a population, presumably due to local adaptation. Without relying on previously identified genes and using the genome-wide approach presented here, novel effectors that were observed to be diversifying in a population-specific manner may be prioritized for further investigation to expedite research on unexplored host-pathogen interactions. Selective sweep analysis identified 92 genes co-localizing with regions that have undergone a selective sweep. Interestingly, we identified multiple sweep regions specific to one of the two populations and no genes located in sweep regions were common to both populations. Similar results were observed in the wheat pathogen <italic>Zymoseptoria tritici</italic>, where the investigation of selective sweeps in four globally distinct populations revealed that genomic regions under selection were largely population specific [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This highlights the ability of plant-pathogenic fungi to rapidly fix advantageous mutations and subsequently shape a population.</p><p>Selective sweep analyses have also been used in a &#x02018;reverse ecology&#x02019; approach to identify genomic regions associated with changes in regional climates. Ellison et al. [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] identified selective sweep regions in the model fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> with haplotypes specific to a population derived from Louisiana or the Caribbean. Following gene characterization within the sweep regions, it was hypothesized and later functionally validated that one sweep region corresponded to local adaptation to cold tolerance. In a similar manner, due to the large variation in climate between the Upper Midwest and the Southern/Eastern United States, it is likely that some of the selective sweeps identified in this study arose in response to regional environmental differences. Additionally, plant pathogenic fungi have developed effector proteins that have functions other than host colonization, such as competition with local microbial communities [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> likely produces such effectors during its saprotrophic stage, and differences in the composition of local microbial populations may be contributing to the diversification or fixation of effector proteins within specific pathogen subpopulations. Combined, these results indicate that selection pressure exerted by specific host genes, regional climate conditions, or other biotic or abiotic environmental factors is driving effector/gene diversification as well as fixation and can be restricted to specific geographical regions.</p><p>It has been documented that multiple mutations often occur in adjacent sites, resulting in a multi-nucleotide mutation (MNM) that causes a nonsynonymous change [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Since MNMs are the result of a single mutation event and do not occur independently in a stepwise manner, they may lead to the overestimation of genes under positive selection [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] As the presence of MNMs was not accounted for in our analyses, the potential exists for false positives; however, we would not expect this phenomenon to differentially affect the gene classes under comparison here (effectors vs. secreted non-effectors vs. non-secreted proteins). Additionally, further investigation is warranted to determine the prevalence of MNMs in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic>, as well as other plant pathogenic fungi, in order to more accurately measure positive selection.</p><p>Analysis of repeat content of the genome facilitated the comparison of the genomic location of genes and levels of diversity. The clear majority (90.9%) of identified repetitive DNA was classified within families of transposable elements. Genes exhibiting PAV were significantly closer to repetitive elements when compared to genes present in all isolates, suggesting that transposable element activity may contribute to gene gain or loss. This phenomenon has also been observed in <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and provides a glimpse into one of the mechanisms giving fungal genomes their plasticity. Additionally, genes residing on the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> accessory chromosome were observed to be evolving faster than genes distributed elsewhere in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008223.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Similar results have been observed in <italic>Zymoseptoria tritici</italic>, where up to eight accessory chromosomes have been observed in a single isolate [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The genes localized on these accessory chromosomes were found to have significantly higher pN/pS ratios when compared to genes residing on the core chromosomes, as well as a lower rate of recombination [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. These results further support the hypothesis that transposable element activity mobilizes beneficial genes and, upon exposure to significant selection pressure in a given locale, the genes may become fixed in a pathogen subpopulation. Additionally, they indicate that the accessory chromosome of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> undergoes evolution at a different rate than the core chromosomes, possibly to accelerate adaptation to various selection pressures.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>GWAS and LD decay</title><p>Using 322,613 SNP/InDel markers, as well as the PAV of <italic>SnToxA</italic> and <italic>SnTox3</italic> obtained through coverage analysis of whole-genome sequences, a robust framework for association mapping was created. This marker set translates to approximately one marker every 114 bp, overwhelmingly meeting our previous estimate of needing one marker every 7 kb to overcome LD decay [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Whole-genome sequencing provided the unique opportunity to examine LD surrounding validated effector loci. In the case of <italic>SnTox3</italic>, the PAV was the most significant marker detected, however, due to the sufficient marker density and LD extending to 6.5 kb, non-causal SNPs were also detected as significant. At the <italic>SnToxA</italic> locus, the PAV of the effector gene was the lone marker identified within the AT-rich isochore. These isochores are found interspersed throughout the genome and their repetitive nature directly hinders the identification of high-confidence nucleotide variants. In this case, the <italic>SnToxA</italic> PAV marker was not the most significant variant but was still in high LD with the most significant SNP residing in the region flanking the AT-rich isochore. This is likely due to missing data associated with individual isolates being removed from the PAV dataset due to low coverage across the entire gene set, subsequently reducing the significance of the marker. Interestingly, LD extended much further into the region flanking <italic>SnToxA</italic> compared to that of <italic>SnTox3</italic>. This resulted in the detection of two strong associations in the regions flanking the <italic>SnToxA</italic>-containing isochore. As <italic>SnTox3</italic> is in the subtelomeric region, its flanking region was likely more prone to recombination and the breakdown of LD, as subtelomeric regions are known to be recombination hotspots in fungi [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The opposite is likely true at the <italic>SnToxA</italic> locus. Due to the presence/absence nature of the region, recombination may be suppressed and therefore preserve LD.</p><p>GWAS also revealed a novel candidate virulence gene encoding a predicted hydrolase. Necrotrophic pathogens have long been thought to use CWD enzymes for the initiation of infection through the degradation of plant cells [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Although necessary for pathogenicity, cell wall degrading enzymes are not typically associated with direct or indirect interactions with host R genes, however, other classes of CWD enzymes have been observed to be under diversifying selection [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. It is hypothesized that these proteins may trigger the plant basal immune response and are therefore diversifying to avoid this detection [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. It is also possible that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> hydrolases are evolving rapidly to develop more efficient lysis of plant cells to enhance virulence. The identification of novel loci associated with virulence using association mapping methodology may facilitate the investigation into pathogen infection strategies, including pathways not necessarily involved in major gene interactions.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Prior to this study, focus had been placed on the investigation of diversity within previously identified effector genes. Whole-genome sequencing of 197 <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> isolates collected from spring, winter, and durum wheat producing regions of the United States revealed the accumulation of non-synonymous changes in suites of effectors specific to geographical regions. Additionally, <italic>SnToxA</italic> was found to be present in nearly all isolates collected from regions where local wheat lines harbor <italic>Tsn1</italic> and absent from isolates collected from regions where <italic>Tsn1</italic> had been removed from locally grown cultivars.

Selective sweep analysis also revealed unique genomic regions specific to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> subpopulations having undergone positive selection, indicating that strong and distinct selective forces are acting on each subpopulation. Taken together, this illustrates the selective power that host susceptibility genes place on the pathogen populations and identifies candidate effector genes specific to the spring and winter wheat production regions of the United States. Also, the identified variants were successfully used in a GWAS to identify strong associations of <italic>SnToxA</italic> and <italic>SnTox3</italic> with disease reaction on winter wheat lines, as well as to detect novel virulence candidates.

Briefly, dried agarose plugs stored at -20 &#x000b0;C of each isolate were brought to room temperature and rehydrated by placing on V8-potato dextrose agar (150 mL V8 juice, 3 g CaCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 g Difco PDA, 10 g agar, 850 mL H<sub>2</sub>O). Plugs were then spread across the plate to distribute the spores and the plates were then incubated at room temperature under a constant fluorescent light regimen for seven days. Pycnidial spores were harvested by flooding the plates with sterile H<sub>2</sub>O and agitation with a sterile inoculation loop. Spores were counted using a hemocytometer, concentration was adjusted to 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> spores per mL, and two drops of Tween20 were added per 100 mL of spore suspension.</p><p>Disease reaction to the 197 <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> isolates was assessed on six wheat cultivars including spring (Alsen) and winter types (Jerry, TAM105, Massey, and F/G95195), as well as a recombinant from a synthetic wheat population (ITMI38). These lines were chosen based on preliminary data that these lines may harbor different susceptibilities with ITMI38 being a differential line for the <italic>Snn3</italic>-SnTox3 interaction. Three seeds of each wheat genotype were sown into cones, comprising a single replicate as described by Friesen and Faris [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. A border of wheat cultivar Alsen was planted to reduce the edge effect. Plants were grown in the greenhouse for approximately two weeks, until the two- to three-leaf stage. Inoculations were conducted as described by Friesen and Faris [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Briefly, plants were inoculated using a paint sprayer until leaves were fully covered, until runoff. Inoculated plants were placed in a mist chamber at 100% humidity for 24 hours and subsequently moved to a climate-controlled growth chamber at 21 &#x000b0;C with a 12-hour photoperiod for six days. Disease ratings were taken seven days post-inoculation using the 0&#x02013;5 scale as described by Liu et al. [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>].

A 500 &#x003bc;L aliquot of each starter culture was transferred to 50 mL of YPD media and incubated at 30 &#x000b0;C and shaking at 250 rpm for 48 hours. Cultures were transferred to 50 mL conical tubes and centrifuged at 3,166 rcf for 10 minutes. Supernatants were decanted and filtered using a 0.45 &#x003bc;m Durapore Membrane Filter (Merck Millipore Ltd.). Filtered supernatant was then lyophilized overnight and stored at -20 &#x000b0;C. Seeds of winter wheat lines Jerry, TAM105, Massey, and F/G95195 were sown in cones and grown under greenhouse conditions for approximately 14 days until the secondary leaf was fully emerged. Freeze-dried protein samples of SnToxA and SnTox3 were resuspended in ddH<sub>2</sub>O and infiltrated into secondary wheat leaves using a needleless syringe. Plants were placed in a growth chamber at 21 &#x000b0;C with a 12-hour photoperiod and evaluated for necrotrophic effector sensitivity after three days.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Genome-wide association analysis</title><p>Association mapping was conducted using TASSEL v5 [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] and GAPIT [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. A na&#x000ef;ve model, as well as a model including the first three components derived from a PCA as fixed effects were used in association analyses in TASSEL v5. A kinship matrix (K) was calculated using the EMMA algorithm. Models incorporating K as a random effect, as well as a model using a combination of PCA and K were analyzed in GAPIT. The most robust model was chosen for each trait by visualization of Q-Q plots produced by GAPIT, illustrating the observed vs expected unadjusted p-values. Marker p-values were adjusted using a false discovery rate (FDR) in the R Statistical Environment. Markers with a FDR adjusted p-value of 0.05 or less were deemed significant.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Linkage disequilibrium</title><p>Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was calculated between the most significant marker detected from association mapping analyses and each intrachromosomal marker in TASSEL v5 [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. LD decay was determined by averaging R<sup>2</sup> values across sliding windows consisting of five markers and observing when average R<sup>2</sup> values fell below 0.20 for three consecutive windows. Position of the extent of LD was taken as the position of the marker at the center of the sliding window before decay.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Putative effector diversification analyses</title><p>The presence of predicted secretion signals and transmembrane domains were identified using DeepSig [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>].

LOF mutations include small InDels causing frameshifts, as well as SNPs/InDels resulting in the loss of a start codon, loss of a stop codon, or gain of a premature stop codon. Isolates from specific subpopulations were grouped and fixed SNPs/LOF mutations (minor allele frequency of 0%) were removed from each dataset. pN/pS ratios were obtained for each gene by the following formula: (N/NSites)/(S/SSites). Genes with pN/pS ratios greater than one were considered to be under diversifying selection, while genes with pN/pS ratios equal to or less than one were considered to be under neutral or purifying selection. Raw counts of LOF mutations were used in comparisons between subpopulations. Protein sequences of the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nodorum</italic> isolate Sn4 annotation were input into InterproScan [<xref rid="pgen.1008223.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] to identify conserved domains and gene ontology.
