Classical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ), which directly re-ligates DNA ends following a double strand break (DSB), has been attributed to the efficient formation of various insertions and deletions (indels), and has thus been most commonly employed for gene disruption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Yet, varying indels can result in disparate phenotypic outcomes ranging from silent mutations to the gain-of-function or loss-of-function (GOF or LOF) of a protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In contrast, DSB repair (DSBR) by homology directed repair (HDR) leads to outcomes dictated by homologous templates. HDR may be used for precise gene editing, albeit at low efficiencies without selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. An alternative pathway, microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), involves end-resection and the alignment of microhomologous sequences flanking DSBs. Subsequent removal of the intermediate sequence results in deletions of predictable size and identity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.

However, sequence context surrounding the DSB is the best understood determinant. DSBs induced by designer nucleases like transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and CRISPR-Cas9 show replicable non-random repair patterns often based on the existence of microhomologies (&#x000b5;Hs) neighboring the DSB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

We applied MHcut to genomic location and sequence data of deletion variants annotated in dbSNP and ClinVar, the latter database containing valuable information on the clinical significance of mutations. MHcut aligns the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; edges of each possible breakpoint that would result in the annotated deletion to the current reference human genome (GRCh38) and checks for maximum matching sequence (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, left). The minimum requirement for MMEJ has been proposed to be as few as 2&#x02009;bp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, since analysis of CRISPR-Cas9 deletion data suggests that no clear correlation exists between repair outcomes following a DNA DSB and homologous sequences less than 3&#x02009;bp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, we opted for a more stringent minimum length of 3&#x02009;bp of &#x000b5;H to classify deletion variants &#x02265;3&#x02009;bp in length as being &#x000b5;H-flanked. Despite observations that imperfect &#x000b5;H can lead to deletions of identical length yet differing sequence matching either the 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; residual &#x000b5;H<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, we only considered consecutive sequence matches as &#x000b5;H in order to conform specifically to annotated variant sequences.</p><p id="Par8">Nearly 44 million deletion variants are represented in the current versions of the dbSNP and ClinVar databases (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, left). Strikingly, of the 19.3 million deletion mutations with a minimum size of 3&#x02009;bp, 57% (11.1 million) are flanked by perfect &#x000b5;Hs of at least 3 bp size, far exceeding the probability expected by random base distribution (0.25<sup>3</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.56%). Surprisingly, for deletions of at least 1 or 2&#x02009;bp size with at least 1 or 2&#x02009;bp flanking &#x000b5;Hs, homologous bases are detected in 75% (expected 0.25<sup>1</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;25%) and 67% (expected 0.25<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.25%) of variants, respectively (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>), implicating microhomology as a common enriched characteristic of human annotated deletion variants. We found a bias in &#x000b5;H-flanked variants towards short deletions of 3 or 4&#x02009;bp (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>) with similarly sized &#x000b5;H (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>), such that 62% of variants have a heterologous sequence distance of zero between them (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>) revealing that &#x000b5;Hs are usually directly abutted. Regarding imperfect &#x000b5;H, allowance for a 1&#x02009;bp mismatch following a perfect stretch of 3&#x02009;bp or more and proceeding at least another single match only extended the homology length for 16% of variants (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>). The variant number could be only slightly extended to 11.9 million, or 62% of all deletions, if the definition of &#x000b5;H was relaxed to allow at least one stretch of continuous &#x000b5;H of 3&#x02009;bp or more, emphasizing that 78% of variants are flanked by perfect &#x000b5;H (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c, d</xref>). The 11.1 million &#x000b5;H-flanked deletions &#x02265;3&#x02009;bp were found to be evenly distributed across all chromosomes (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1e</xref>), with the vast majority residing in intronic or intergenic locations (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1f</xref>). Still, 98,848 variants can be found in exonic regions, with 88% of all protein coding genes containing at least one &#x000b5;H-flanked deletion mutation in an exon (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>), making large functional genomic screens feasible. The fact that less than 0.1% of &#x000b5;H-flanked deletions are annotated for clinical significance shows that there is an outstanding need for further functional exploration (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1g</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>MHcut selects CRISPR sites for genome editing</title><p id="Par9">In the interest of generating more natural and disease-relevant mutations with high efficiency, we further developed MHcut to select candidates for creation by CRISPR-Cas9 cleavage and subsequent repair by MMEJ. To orchestrate MMEJ deletions, MHcut searches the local sequence of selected &#x000b5;H-flanked deletion variants for CRISPR-Cas9 protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs) positioned so as to cause a DSB between the flanking &#x000b5;H, while retaining at least 3&#x02009;bp of &#x000b5;H on either side of the break (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, c</xref>, right). MHcut then evaluates the upstream protospacer sequences of appropriately positioned PAMs to act as unique gRNAs in the reference human genome. We initially chose to consider only &#x02018;NGG&#x02019; sequences, the canonical <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> Cas9 (SpCas9) PAM, since SpCas9 represents the most commonly used and adaptable nuclease with a well-characterized cleavage site +3&#x02009;bp upstream of the PAM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Amongst the 11.1 million variants, 10% could be targeted with a unique SpCas9 gRNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, right), matching the predicted probability of &#x02018;GG&#x02019; in positions +/&#x02212;5, 6 on one side of the deletion (12.5%) for abutted &#x000b5;H, yet biasing the data set towards variants with more distant &#x000b5;Hs due to the higher probability of identifying internal &#x02018;NGG&#x02019; sites and unique gRNAs. Of the 10% of variants (1,120,479) that could be targeted with a unique SpCas9 gRNA, 3% are in exons (33,986). Of these variants, 33% or 11,168 deletions would result in a frameshift. Of note, 95% of these are variants of unknown significance (VUS). PAM requirements may be modified in MHcut in order to accommodate engineered SpCas9 variants (or alternative CRISPR/Cas systems introducing a blunt-ended cut) and expand the number of targetable variants. For example, allowing for engineered xCas9 with a relaxed PAM requirement targeting &#x02018;NG&#x02019;, &#x02018;GAA&#x02019; and &#x02018;GAT&#x02019;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, increases the targetable number of variants to 33%.</p><p id="Par10">For each gRNA and DSB site identified, MHcut also checks for &#x000b5;Hs concealed inside of the annotated deletion variant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, right). This step allows for the voluntary exclusion of variants with nested &#x000b5;Hs that could theoretically reduce the efficiency of the desired deletion pattern, as &#x000b5;H with shorter intervening heterology are expected to be used preferentially<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. An initial test at a locus in the GLA gene associated with Fabry disease revealed that nested &#x000b5;Hs indeed reduce the efficiency of the targeted repair pattern (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a, b</xref>). Removing all variants with nested &#x000b5;Hs further reduces the candidate list to about half (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, right). Additional filters are available to select variants of interest and associated gRNAs based for example on genomic location, clinical significance and prevalence of target editing outcome as predicted by the inDelphi tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

After 48&#x02009;h, genomic DNA from the population was extracted and analyzed as described above.

In order to demonstrate this diversity in genotype/phenotype correlation, we established disease models for two target genes encoding enzymes in the heme synthesis pathway. In erythroid cells, 5&#x02032;-Aminolevulinate Synthase 2 (ALAS2) is the first enzyme of the heme synthesis pathway producing 5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). In other cell types, the paralog ALAS1 is expressed exclusively. 5-ALA is processed to Protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) by further enzymes. Ferrochelatase (FECH), the last and rate limiting enzyme of the pathway, integrates iron into PPIX to form heme. The ALAS2-4bpDel mutation (rs387906472) causes a frame shift (Glu569Glyfs) and extension of the ALAS2 protein C-terminus (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) resulting in a GOF allele with increased ALAS2 enzymatic activity leading to an overproduction of 5-ALA and PPIX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.

The rs786205248 deletion variant results in&#x000a0;a frame shift (Tyr194Leufs) and premature stop codon at amino acid position 208 rendering the protein non-functional (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Patients with the rs786205248 variant have a condition called Erythropoietic Protoporphyria (EPP). Similar to XLP, EPP is associated with photosensitivity of the skin and an increased risk of liver damage due to an accumulation of PPIX in cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). In humans this particular mutation of FECH is autosomal dominant, and can only be found in a heterozygous conformation. Indeed, in our experiment no hiPSC clones presented homozygosity for the 5&#x02009;bp deletion mutation or the second most common mutation, a 1&#x02009;bp insertion (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), either of which induce distinct frameshifts leading to premature stop codons. Our data suggest that FECH mutations are generally homozygous lethal in hiPSCs, which may account for the reduced indel ratio observed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Three clones made by RNP transfection were confirmed to be heterozygous with one normal allele and the precise MMEJ deletion on the other allele (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a</xref>).

This is consistent with the results found in EPP patient fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, and suggests that the FECH enzyme amount produced by heterozygous mutant cells is still sufficient to process PPIX under in vitro conditions. In addition, insufficient maturation of the heme synthesis pathway for in vitro differentiated erythroid cells may complicate comparison to in vivo disease conditions. Nevertheless, we could trigger a PPIX accumulation phenotype in undifferentiated FECH-5bpDel hiPSC clones by stressing the heme synthesis pathway through supplementation with additional 5-ALA in the culture medium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.

The mean prevalence predicted by inDelphi (average score from available mESC, HCT116, HEK293, K562, U2OS cell data) for all MHcut variants with available Cas9 gRNA indicates that, depending on &#x000b5;H length, &#x000b5;H distances between 4 and 10&#x02009;bp are expected to cause the MMEJ ratio of the target deletion to drop below 20% on average (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7a</xref>).</p><p id="Par22">To validate this data in hiPSCs, we chose a set of candidate variants with &#x000b5;H distances between 3 and 10&#x02009;bp (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7b</xref>) from our short-listed pathogenic variants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), and transfected RNP complexes as described above (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>).

Both the full &#x000b5;H and the first stretch of exact &#x000b5;H is saved. Summary metrics on the &#x000b5;H include homology, distance between &#x000b5;Hs and GC content. The &#x000b5;H is scored as the sum of matches in the full &#x000b5;H and the length of the first stretch of exact &#x000b5;H. The flanking configuration with the strongest score is then selected for further analysis. Of note, a variant of the tool was implemented to report results for both flanking configurations but showed minimal differences. In many cases the same deletion can be represented by different coordinates and can be shifted without affecting the deletion represented. For this reason, MHcut will also shift each deletion as much as possible and pick the coordinates that result in the longest &#x000b5;H.</p><p id="Par29">Once the &#x000b5;H is defined, we select potential gRNAs.

To filter cuts that would lead to large heterologies in large deletions, only cuts within 50&#x02009;bp of the &#x000b5;Hs are considered. Of note, this output still allows to design experiments with two cuts, one close to each &#x000b5;H, to recreate large deletions.

Briefly, before the start of erythroid cell differentiation hiPSCs were prepared at clonal density (~400 cells) in a 10&#x02009;cm cell culture dish and cultured for about 7 days as described above, until the colonies reached a size between 750&#x02013;1000&#x02009;&#x000b5;m in diameter. The erythroid differentiation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>) was started by changing the medium to Essential 8 (E8; Gibco) containing 80&#x02009;ng/mL VEGFA (R&#x00026;D system), 2&#x02009;&#x000b5;M CHIR99021 (Merck) and 80&#x02009;ng/mL BMP4 (R&#x00026;D system).

From day 4 onwards, cells were cultured in Stemline II medium (Sigma) containing 50&#x02009;ng/mL SCF and 10&#x02009;U/mL Erythopoietin (EPO, Merck). In addition, from day 4 until day 21, 50&#x02009;ng/mL IL-6 (R&#x00026;D system) were added to the medium. Furthermore, from day 4 until day 10, samples were cultured in 50&#x02009;ng/mL IL-3 (R&#x00026;D system), 5&#x02009;ng/mL TPO (R&#x00026;D system) and 50&#x02009;ng/mL Flt3/Flk2 (FI3, R&#x00026;D system). Also, from day 4 until day 6 80&#x02009;ng/mL VEGFA were added to the medium.
