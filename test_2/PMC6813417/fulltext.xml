Despite its huge commercial success as a blockbuster anticancer drug and its promising efficacy against other non-cancer diseases, Taxol supply remains limited due to the poor extraction yields caused by extremely low accumulation levels in yew plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The past two decades saw considerable efforts being channeled toward development of alternative production methods to improve yields and build reliable, cost-effective production systems. Chemical synthesis and synthesis from cell and tissue cultures from <italic>Taxus</italic> species have been attempted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, productivity of these approaches cannot meet the increasing demand or the production pipelines are either too complicated or economically unfeasible. An alternative approach is production by semi-synthesis from two key intermediates of Taxol: baccatin III and 10-deacetylbaccatin III, both still extracted from renewable needles of <italic>Taxus</italic> trees or cell cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">It is against this backdrop that great efforts have been directed toward synthetic production of committed Taxol intermediates through optimization of microbial hosts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Resources to complement these efforts have come from studies on Taxol pathway elucidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, gene cloning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and characterization of enzyme mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Despite these significant gains, the failure to achieve total biotechnological production of Taxol lies in the non-effective expression of known pathway enzymes and the dearth of knowledge on its complex biosynthetic pathway. The Taxol biosynthetic pathway consists of at least 19 steps from GGPP (geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, including a number of cytochrome P450 (CYP) mediated modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Taxadiene, the first committed intermediate of the pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> has been produced in heterologous hosts with some degree of success, however, attempts to produce the next intermediate, taxadiene-5&#x003b1;-ol (a product of a cytochrome P450 enzyme, taxadiene-5&#x003b1;-hydroxylase, T5&#x003b1;H) have been met with disappointing results. Breakthrough work in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> that employed a multivariate-modular approach towards metabolic pathway engineering achieved taxadiene yield of 1.0&#x02009;g&#x02009;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, but this optimality was lost and titers fell considerably when T5&#x003b1;H was introduced into the same strain (only 50&#x02009;mg&#x02009;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of taxadiene-5&#x003b1;-ol)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. A possible hypothesis to explain this was that <italic>E. coli</italic> was not a tractable host for P450 chemistry, leading to the subsequent design of a microbial consortia of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, the microbial competition in that hybrid system could not be completely avoided. Recently, through a rather extensive optimization of CYP expression, reductase-partner interactions and N-terminal modifications, this obstacle seemed to have been partially overcome in <italic>E. coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, achieving almost 570&#x02009;mg&#x02009;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of oxygenated taxanes, but the extensive construction of vectors in this approach was noted to be too laborious, and fine-tuned taxoid production would still be perturbed by introduction of an additional CYP. Considering that there are nine P450 enzymes involved in the Taxol biosynthesis pathway, including four that remain to be uncovered (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), huge challenges remain to be addressed to successfully engineer microbes as chassis for this pathway.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Scheme of Taxol biosynthesis.

However, despite these merits, the complex plant cell presents several drawbacks for it to be used as a successful chassis for heterologous production of natural compounds. It is highly compartmentalized, and transport mechanisms of metabolites are not fully understood. It also has both the MEP and MVA pathways and a repertoire of native enzymes and pathways that are difficult to control, predict and optimize. Thus, despite being preferred hosts for plant P450s, past attempts to construct the Taxol pathway for production of taxadiene-5&#x003b1;-ol in plants were completely unsuccessful, while only low taxadiene accumulation was achieved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par25">Recently, compartmentalized metabolic engineering in <italic>Nicotiana spp</italic>. has emerged as a promising strategy to overcome some of these problems and improve yields of terpenoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Recent engineering efforts to target P450s to the thylakoid membranes through the pH-dependent twin-arginine translocation (Tat) complex have demonstrated the competitiveness of the chloroplast as a site for light driven P450-mediated hydroxylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. In this work, we confirmed that TS possesses a plastid targeting signal peptide and that T5&#x003b1;H and CPR possess ER-localization signal peptides (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), implying there is a physical barrier between the site of production of taxadiene and the site of its subsequent oxygenations. We thus employed a compartmentalized metabolic engineering strategy to introduce T5&#x003b1;H and CPR into the chloroplast (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Given that TS is natively targeted to the chloroplast, we considered mimicking TS post-translational processing and localization in the chloroplast in our importation strategy of T5H-CPR fusion construct into the chloroplast compartment. Therefore, the use of the native TS signal peptide as a chloroplast targeting peptide was considered more optimal compared to the Tat complex in our engineering, to ensure similar translocation strategies and close proximity of TS and the P450-CPR tailoring enzymes.</p><p id="Par26">Another longstanding challenge in bioengineering terpenes in heterologous hosts is the limited supply of IPP and DMAPP, the universal precursors of all terpenes. We compared the expression profiles of MVA and MEP genes in control (empty vector) and TS-transgenic plants and identified, in the context of engineering taxane pathway, that DXS, DXR (MEP pathway) and HMGR (MVA) were downregulated in TS-expressing plants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). We speculated that this could have been caused by an inherent mechanism to limit carbon flow through the pathways in response to the introduced gene. To re-direct carbon flow towards diterpenoid synthesis, we upregulated GGPPS together with the upstream MEP and MVA genes. Some or all of these genes have been targeted before for production of taxadiene and other diterpenoids, achieving varying degrees of success<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Compared to overexpressing TS alone, co-expression with GGPPS and DXS resulted in a significant increase in taxadiene, and our chloroplastic engineering of oxygenated taxanes improved the levels of taxadiene-5&#x003b1;-ol from 0.9&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> FW to 1.3&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> FW when combined with precursor enhancement.</p><p id="Par27">Co-expression of HMGR with TS increased accumulation of a metabolite with a very similar retention time to taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene. We sought to explore this further and possibly leverage on the MVA pathway for improving production of taxanes. Overexpression of a better performing tHMGR clearly improved the closely related contaminating peak, but not taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene. There are numerous conflicting reports regarding the role of each pathway in supplying carbon for Taxol synthesis: evidence exist that there is little or no crosstalk between the pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>, but inhibitors of each pathway have been shown to inhibit Taxol biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. To further address the issue of the source of precursors for Taxol biosynthesis in a heterologous plant, we generated stable TS-transgenic plants and grew them on media with either fosmidomycin or lovastatin, the inhibitors of each pathway. In agreement with the DXS and HMGR overexpression result, pathway inhibition data showed that only fosmidomycin completely blocked taxadiene production in tobacco leaves while lovastatin-inhibited plants accumulated substantial amounts of taxadiene. The observed differences in the phenotypes in treated plants demonstrated the effectiveness of the inhibition treatments of both the MVA and the MEP pathways, giving weight to the inference that the MEP pathway supplies the bulk of the isoprenoid precursors for the taxane carbon backbone in plants.</p><p id="Par28">Together with taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene, we also identified verticillene, taxa-4(20),11(12)-diene and taxa-3(4), 11(12)-diene in hexane extracts of transgenic plants. Furthermore, though the engineered plants accumulated taxadiene-5&#x003b1;-ol, we also identified two other mono-oxygenated taxanes OCT, and iso-OCT. The appearance of these latter compounds instead of the desired taxadiene-5&#x003b1;-ol was observed in other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup> and led to different proposals for the mechanism of catalysis by T5&#x003b1;H. Based on several lines of evidence, a proposal was forwarded that T5&#x003b1;H catalyzes taxadiene to an epoxide intermediate that decomposes to many products like taxadiene-5&#x003b1;-ol, OCT and iso-OCT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup> rather than through the earlier proposed radical abstraction mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par29">Our attempt to construct the pathway further by adding T10&#x003b2;H and T5A did not yield expected results of taxadiene-5&#x003b1;-yl acetate and taxadiene-5&#x003b1;-acetoxy-10&#x003b2;-ol, but we observed a peak at 23.5&#x02009;min (with dominant masses at m/z 304, probably representing taxadiene-5&#x003b1;,10&#x003b2;-diol) that accumulated to only low levels. There was a marked decrease in the taxadiene-5&#x003b1;-ol peak following introduction of T10&#x003b2;H and T5A (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>), and given that there were no observed changes in the expression of TS, T5aH and CPR protein levels, this demonstrates consumption of taxadiene-5&#x003b1;-ol in transgenic leaves. It remains to be seen if this peak we identified is one of the committed mono-oxygenated taxane intermediates that deserves to be optimized for increased production, or if it is one of the many dead-end products from spontaneous degradation of the epoxide intermediate.</p><p id="Par30">Metabolic flux in plants is tightly controlled by complex regulatory mechanisms, and an improved understanding of gene and protein expression landscape is fundamental for achieving precise control and fine-tuning of engineered pathways. Gene expression analysis of native MVA and MEP pathway genes in the early period following agroinfiltration demonstrated varying trends, implying internal adjustment and transcriptional regulation of native precursor pathways. We targeted genes that decreased mRNA expression levels for overexpression and achieved an eight folds improvement in taxadiene and oxidized terpenes, demonstrating the importance of an improved understanding of temporal regulation.</p><p id="Par31">Altogether, this study presents <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> as an attractive and amenable alternative platform to microbial systems for engineering production of taxanes. Compared to well-established microbial systems, heterologous plant systems present challenges as biosynthetic machineries due to their complex cell structure and difficulties in optimizing growth conditions following genetic manipulation. Our approach using compartmentalized engineering coupled with precursor enhancement resulted in comparatively high taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene yields and most importantly, accumulation of taxadiene-5&#x003b1;-ol in a plant platform. Given the attractiveness of plant systems as safe, cost-effective platforms that harness sunlight and natural carbon to synthesize heterologous compounds, the taxane yields in fresh tobacco leaf tissue reported here are comparable to other reports in microbial and yeast platforms. Moreover, with the successful production of committed taxadiene-5&#x003b1;-ol in plant cells, it is highly expected that the convenient expression of P450s in plant systems as demonstrated here might help establish a fast screening platform to complete the Taxol pathway in the foreseeable future. In conclusion, this study presents a significant and crucial step for future biotechnological efforts towards Taxol production, and the strategies and tools employed here could be valuable in circumventing bottlenecks in plant systems and in guiding ongoing efforts to bioengineer Taxol production in plants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p id="Par32"><italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> plants were grown from seeds in soil in a growth chamber with a 16-h light and 8-h dark photo-cycle at 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.
