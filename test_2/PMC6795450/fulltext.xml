Erythrocytes from PKD patients show an energetic imbalance and are susceptible to hemolysis. Gene editing of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) would provide a therapeutic benefit and improve safety of gene therapy approaches to treat PKD patients. In previous studies, we established a gene editing protocol that corrected the PKD phenotype of PKD-iPSC lines through a TALEN mediated homologous recombination strategy. With the goal of moving toward more clinically relevant stem cells, we aim at editing the <italic>PKLR</italic> gene in primary human hematopoietic progenitors and hematopoietic stem cells (HPSCs). After nucleofection of the gene editing tools and selection with puromycin, up to 96% colony forming units showed precise integration. However, a low yield of gene edited HPSCs was associated to the procedure. To reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy, we worked on i) optimizing gene editing tools and ii) defining optimal expansion and selection times. Different versions of specific nucleases (TALEN and CRISPR-Cas9) were compared. TALEN mRNAs with 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; added motifs to increase RNA stability were the most efficient nucleases to obtain high gene editing frequency and low toxicity. Shortening ex vivo manipulation did not reduce the efficiency of homologous recombination and preserved the hematopoietic progenitor potential of the nucleofected HPSCs. Lastly, a very low level of gene edited HPSCs were detected after engraftment in immunodeficient (NSG) mice. Overall, we showed that gene editing of the <italic>PKLR</italic> gene in HPSCs is feasible, although further improvements must to be done before the clinical use of the gene editing to correct PKD.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007136</institution-id><institution>Secretar&#x000ed;a de Estado de Investigaci&#x000f3;n, Desarrollo e Innovaci&#x000f3;n</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>(SAF2017-84248-P)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Segovia</surname><given-names>Jose C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004587</institution-id><institution>Instituto de Salud Carlos III</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RD16/0011/0011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bueren</surname><given-names>Juan A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>IIS-FJD</institution></funding-source><award-id>Terapias Avanzadas</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bueren</surname><given-names>Juan A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from &#x0201c;Ministerio de Econom&#x000ed;a, Comercio y Competitividad y Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER)&#x0201d; (SAF2017-84248-P), &#x0201c;Fondo de Investigaciones Sanitarias, Instituto de Salud Carlos III&#x0201d; (RD16/0011/0011) and &#x0201c;Instituto de Investigaci&#x000f3;n Sanitaria de la Fundaci&#x000f3;n Jim&#x000e9;nez D&#x000ed;az&#x0201d;.

The prevalence of PKD is estimated at 51 cases per million among the white population[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. PKD is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the Pyruvate kinase L/R gene (<italic>PKLR</italic>), which lead to a total or partial reduction of the activity of the erythroid isoform of pyruvate kinase protein (R-type pyruvate kinase, RPK). To date, more than 200 different mutations in the <italic>PKLR</italic> gene have been linked to PKD[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This disease is associated with reticulocytosis, splenomegaly and iron overload, and may be life-threatening in severely affected patients. Therapy options for PKD are palliative and include regular red blood cell transfusion, splenectomy and iron chelation therapy. So far, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) represents the only curative treatment for severely affected patients[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, allogeneic HSCT is not considered as routine in these patients and the overall survival rate after allogeneic HSCT in PKD is relatively low, mainly due to the toxicity of the procedure and graft versus host disease (GvHD)[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, the availability of compatible donors is very low. Autologous HSCT of genetically corrected cells would overcome these limitations[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Autologous HSCT of genetically corrected cells, also called hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy is being used to treat many blood cell genetic diseases[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], including several red blood cell pathologies such as &#x003b2;-thalasemia[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223775.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] or sickle cell disease[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We have recently developed a lentiviral vector to correct PKD[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which has been granted orphan drug designation (EU/3/14/1330; FDA #DRU-2016-5168). This lentiviral-mediated gene therapy approach would offer a durable and curative clinical benefit with a single treatment.</p><p>Over the last few years, gene editing has emerged as a promising gene therapy approach for blood cell disorders, since genetic mutations can be accurately corrected. The swift spread of gene editing has been possible thanks to the development of engineered DNA nucleases such as zinc-fingers nucleases (ZFN), Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) or cluster regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system. Gene editing technology allows gene inactivation, integration at specific locus or correction of specific mutation. This promising technology has been adapted to correct hematopoietic inherited diseases as an ideal gene therapy. Different approaches have been reported as potential gene therapy for several blood cell diseases. Initially, these gene editing strategies were developed in induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) to correct different genetic pathologies such as X-linked chronic granulomatosis (X-CGD)[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], &#x003b1;-thalassemia[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223775.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], &#x003b2;-thalassemia[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], sickle cell anemia[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223775.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], Diamond Blackfan anemia[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or Fanconi Anemia[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this direction, we previously described the correction of PKD phenotype in patient-specific iPSC through a knock-in strategy mediated by a specific TALEN<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, targeting the second intron of <italic>PKLR</italic> gene[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], establishing that gene editing may be a potential therapeutic option to correct PKD. Thanks to recent developments, gene editing is now considered as a real therapeutic option to be applied to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) directly. Different groups have reported efficient gene editing to correct genetic blood cell diseases such as X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1)[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], JAK3 severe combined immunodeficiency[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], X-CGD[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], &#x003b2;-thalassemia[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], sickle cell anemia[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223775.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and Fanconi Anemia[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The high level of correction in HSPCs obtained without significant off-target effects suggests that the clinical use of gene editing therapy to correct genetic hematopoietic diseases is highly likely in the short term.</p><p>Here, we describe the rational path to adapt our previous gene editing approach to correct PKD in HSPCs, which is based on the optimization of the protocol conditions and the inclusion of RNA stabilizer domains[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223775.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and show the advantages and limitations of current editing approaches for the treatment of PKD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cell lines and primary cells from healthy donors</title><p>HEK293T cells were obtained from ATCC and grown in DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% Hyclone (GE Healthcare) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (Gibco).</p><p>Umbilical cord blood samples (CB) from healthy donors were provided by <italic>Centro de Transfusi&#x000f3;n de la Comunidad de Madrid</italic>.

Although corrected iPSCs can be therapeutic alternatives for some pathologies[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], they are not a clinically applicable cell source for the treatment of blood diseases yet. Different research groups have made significant improvements in the generation of HSPCs from iPSC[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, this process is still very inefficient. Therefore, important efforts have been made to apply gene editing technology directly to HSPCs, overcoming the important difficulties associated with the hematopoietic differentiation from iPSCs. So far, only few groups have described a level of gene editing efficacy in HSPCs potentially compatible with their clinical use[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223775.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223775.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223775.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In those reports, a combination of nucleases provided as DNA, mRNA or RNP together with viral vectors carrying the therapeutic matrix allowed gene modification in human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells.</p><p>Many efforts have been made in order to improve endonuclease activity and delivery into target cells. Nucleofection of TALEN mRNA clearly reduced the toxicity of the protocol. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; modifications of messenger RNAs could improve the stability of the mRNA and their overall translation efficiency. Some of this modifications include the 3&#x02019;UTR of &#x003b2;-Globin, which has demonstrated improvement in mRNA stability[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and the 5&#x02019;UTR secondary structure of the VEEV, which has been shown to alter <italic>Ifit1</italic> binding and function as an evasion mechanism by which alphaviruses use RNA structural motifs to avoid immune restriction[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Here, we have observed that TALEN mRNAs with both modifications facilitate the use of this nuclease in human HPSCs.</p><p>Here, we combined TALEN mRNA and donor matrix as plasmid DNA to get efficient specific integration of the therapeutic donor in the desired locus in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. Up to 70% of TALEN-treated HSPCs were edited after puromycin selection. We believe that this efficacy of gene correction would be sufficient to correct PKD after transplantation. Indeed, a minimum of 30% corrected stem cells, either healthy or transduced with retroviral vectors, is sufficient to compensate the diseased phenotype[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, the amount of corrected HSCs with the ability to engraft NSG mice obtained and the overall yield of the protocol is still too low to be considered as clinically applicable.</p><p>Some limitations can be seen that diminish the overall effectiveness of the protocol. First, nucleases should be active at the appropriate moment to facilitate gene editing. Thus, co-nucleofection of nucleases and repair matrix may not be the optimal solution. Second, the delivery methods to provide the repair matrix may impact the overall gene editing efficacy. The nucleofection procedure has been shown to be very toxic in some cases[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223775.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. We have observed similar toxic effects here when applied to <italic>PKLR</italic> gene editing in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. Efforts to tackle this limitation by the use of microfluids[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] or vectorizing the donor therapeutic matrix using AAV viral vectors have been shown to be very efficient in the case of the &#x003b2;-Globin gene<sup>23</sup>. Both improvements are being currently explored in our laboratory. Third, puromycin selection system might favor the selection of hematopoietic progenitors with several integrations. Indeed, there was a considerably number of Puro<sup>R</sup> CFUs without the specific integration; those clones either can have integrated the donor matrix in different genomic sites randomly, or may have not been properly selected with the treatment. It should be noted, however, that the percentage of hematopoietic progenitors with integration in the two alleles of <italic>PKLR</italic> locus is high (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0223775.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), which might reflect the selective pressure of the puromycin treatment.</p><p>All these improvements aim to get a clinically relevant gene editing efficacy in primitive HSCs. Although we were able to obtain a significant frequency of gene edited hematopoietic progenitors, we failed to target the most primitive HPSCs, getting only a small evidence of gene editing in NSG engraftable HSCs.</p><p>CRISPR/Cas9 system is nowadays frequently used because of its convenience for design and implementation[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223775.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Our results indicate that, at least in this genomic region, the developed TALEN and the CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases are performing similarly in terms of cleavage efficiency (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223775.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0223775.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). However, <italic>PKLR</italic> TALEN<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> showed a slightly higher efficacy triggering targeted insertion of therapeutic donor matrix. Recently, CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease has been reported to be more efficient than TALEN[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223775.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] for genome editing. This apparent discrepancy could be explained by (i) differences in the target sgRNA used in these studies, or (ii) by TALEN design its self. The 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; modifications introduced within our TALEN mRNAs could also favor the better performance of the specific TALE nucleases. Additionally, the use of CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease as RNP is known to improve the efficacy of cutting, which was also verified in our system, but this <italic>PKLR</italic> RNP efficacy was similar to the <italic>PKLR</italic> TALEN mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223775.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0223775.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), so we can conclude that both platforms, <italic>PKLR</italic> TALEN and <italic>PKLR</italic> RNP, have similar efficacy to target the second intron of <italic>PKLR</italic> gene.</p><p>A very important factor in achieving efficient gene editing in HSPC is the availability of optimal <italic>in vitro</italic> culture conditions that facilitates their genetic manipulation without losing their stem cell properties. Many efforts and improvements have been made over the last decades in this respect. However, up to now it has only been possible to maintain HSPC <italic>in vitro</italic> for a very limited time[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223775.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In this report, we have reduced the time required for the manipulation and selection of the cells without losing gene editing efficacy. Unexpectedly, although dmPGE<sub>2</sub> has recently been reported as a very useful molecule to enhance HPSC survival, proliferation and engraftment[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223775.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], and to help in HPSC gene editing[<xref rid="pone.0223775.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], in our hands the addition of dmPGE<sub>2</sub> to our culture conditions decreased the efficiency to enrich gene editing HSPCs. Perhaps its beneficial effect increased the resistance of HSPCs (gene edited or not) to the puromycin selection, consequently human engraftment was enhanced since the survival of HSPCs without HDR was promoted by dmPGE<sub>2</sub> treatment.</p><p>Overall, we show that gene editing of the <italic>PKLR</italic> locus in HSPCs is feasible but it might be applied in the clinical setting only after further improvements aimed at increasing efficiency, yield and targeting of HSCs. The field of gene editing is developing very fast. New improvements combined with those described in this manuscript will make the correction of <italic>PKLR</italic> gene by gene editing clinically applicable for the treatment of PKD in the near future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0223775.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Monoallelic and biallelic gene editing frequencies.</title><p>(A) Diagram of PCR analysis.

Through a thorough reading and reviewing, I think this manuscript can be accepted after minor revision. The main questions in this manuscript to my point of view are as follows.</p><p>1. Abbreviations (e.g. RPK and PKLR) should be explained at the first occurrence in the text.</p><p>2.</p><p>3. According to the supplementary data, several figures in the first paragraph of page 13 seem to be miscalculated: 56% should be 53.8%, while 44% should be 46%. In addition, the source of the data for &#x0201c;5.8 knock-in CFUs out of 1000 initial CBCD34+ cells&#x0201d; could not be found.</p><p>4.</p><p>5. In Results part, the authors declare that the use of dmPGE2 did not improve the efficiency of the specific integration. However it seems cursory to draw this conclusion just based on 4 CFUs. To support this conclusion, more puromycin-selected colonies are needs for further analysis although the dmPGE2 treatment will do harm to hCD34+ cells and make it hard to yield colonies.</p><p>6. The figure legends in the text are too simple to understand. It is important to provide enough information so that the readers can easily understand the content of article. For example, what does the &#x003bb; in Figure 2A and IX in Figure 3B mean? Are they DNA markers or something else?</p><p>Reviewer #2: Overview</p><p>This manuscript outlines a study using CRISPR- and TALEN-directed gene editing to repair mutations in the PKLR gene, which produces a pyruvate kinase, mutations within which are responsible for pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD). This rare metabolic disease has been a target of previous gene editing protocols but the overall outcome was was disappointing sense a low yield of corrected cells was attained. As has been seen for other gene editing protocols, attempts to increase the gene repair efficiency led to a significant level of toxicity. The authors now extend the work by comparing several programmable nucleases and their associated systems coupled to a more clear definition of expansion and selection time. The results are somewhat disappointing but not truly unexpected, since many ex vivo approaches, designed with the best of intentions, lead to a very low level of gene edited HPSCs following engraftment. The authors conclude that they have demonstrated the feasibility of gene editing of the PKLR gene yet further improvements must be made in order to achieve clinical application.</p><p>Critique</p><p>Overall, this is a standard targeting approach to a metabolic disease, a group of diseases that have a myriad of mutations possibly approachable by gene editing. What sounds so simple is so hard because it's not just about the gene editing, which likely works with high efficiency and specificity now, but rather about the treatment of the cells before and after the reaction. These are well-established authors who have a good track record of publishing solid work and this is no exception. I would suggest some modifications to the manuscript particularly in terms of detail. I think it's also important that the authors develop a stronger argument as to why their work is worth publishing even though for the overall scientific community, they do provide some important information. Just showing that gene editing in PKLR is feasible in a new cell type, is really not meeting the high bar now set for publication in significant journals. My recommendation is to accept the paper with major revision following the points below:</p><p>On page 5, in the first section of the Methods and Materials, the authors indicate that they are growing CD34+ cells in antibiotics. While it's clear that using puromycin as a selection is helpful experimentally , this will be problematic in a transition to ex vivo gene editing protocols. Antibiotic treatment of any cells causes major redistribution of metabolic pathways including that associated with gene editing. Why did they choose to do so as it is not usually a good idea? A strong argument needs to be made as to how this would impact clinical application only because their previous work have moved along this path already. This is important points of the will likely affect the outcome of their experiments and the generalization of their experiments into clinical application. It's also important to define the concentration of puromycin in more detail.</p><p>The RNP is a logical choice for use in any sort of ex vivo application but it appears out of nowhere and so what concentrations were used and why were they chosen? The RNP has a rapid turnover in the cell and in the nucleus and in some cases does not actually reach the nucleus.</p><p>While I do not follow this exact field, I did notice several papers appearing Molecular Therapy (NA) last year that detailed the challenges with delivery of ex vivo therapy (Modarai et al). I often utilize this paper as an example of how the details are important and that transfection efficiency can often modify/slant outcomes... I would reference this paper and discuss how the authors overcome this important experimental parameter.</p><p>What is the role of dmPGE(2)? ( page 7).</p><p>While this is not the authors problem, it's now widely accepted that the Surveyor Assay does not sufficiently reflect CRISPR activity in human cells. And, while the equation used to develop the percentage of cleavage is useful, this assay misses small indels less than 3 to 4 bases.... DNA sequence analysis and TIDE must be used in parallel even in the early sections of the work.</p><p>The authors need to explain why they do not see any heterozygotes ? I'm actually a bit surprised by this as one would expect to see a small percentage of them.</p><p>On page 13, the authors loosely use the term homologous recombination.... It is now true that gene editing has become a garbage heap of terms, mostly inappropriate, the authors need to be quite careful in using the term homologous recombination. The basket term is now considered homology-directed repair since homologous recombination is reserved for chromosomal crossovers that occurr during meiosis and, less often, in mitosis. It's not a big point, but it's a bit sloppy.</p><p>I'm a little surprised about the toxicity associated with DNA nucleofection since much of the rest of the world believes that nucleofection is much gentler than electroporation.... Please explain.</p><p>On page 16, this goes back to my point about referencing previous data that has already established..i.e. lack of activity in expression constructs as opposed to the RNP. While it is true that senior investigators such as this group have made important contributions and often reflect on their own work, there's no use reinventing the wheel. I think of a simple scan of the literature might be helpful to avoid experimental activity whose outcome is quite predictable, and has been previously reported.</p><p>Page 17, once again, the trend outlined in Table 2 has been previously reported... And needs to be cited.</p><p>A good place to talk about the delivery variations is in the Disucssion... Previous information, I suggest on page 23 at the bottom continuing on to page 24.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.
