Temperature is an environmental variable that has profound impacts on the physiology of living organisms. If the temperature falls outside of the range an organism could tolerate, depending on the duration of exposure, damage to cellular components will ensue, eventually leading to cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In yeast, response to heat stress is most well studied in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, in which the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways play critical roles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. There are currently 5 known MAPK signaling pathways in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>. In response to elevated temperatures, the cell wall integrity (CWI) and high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> are activated. The HOG pathway involves two independent branches, the Sho1 branch that involves osmosensors Hrk1 and Msb2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and Sho1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and the Sln1 branch with Sln1 as the osmosensor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Heat stress activates the CWI pathway by two transmembrane sensors, Slg1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and Mid2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>; deletion of components in this signaling cascade have been shown to result in slow growth at 30&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and cell lysis at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In addition, heat stress also activates Hog1, the MAPK of HOG pathway, via the Sho1 branch, but not the Sln1 branch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The heat stress-activated Hog1 contributes to the rapid cell recovery from the challenge; interestingly, it is not localized in the nucleus after activation in response to heat, suggesting that the phenotypic effects are not due to its direct downstream transcriptional regulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.

Interestingly, there was a lack of significant increases in OD<sub>600</sub> observed in T1 and T2 populations before generation ~37 even though expansion was observed in the GFP-subpopulations, suggesting that VERT is more sensitive in detecting adaptive events. However, due to the rapid sweep of one of the colored-subpopulations in 2 out of 3 parallel populations, use of VERT data to identify subsequent adaptive events in the population was not possible, thus increases in OD<sub>600</sub> values were used instead.

The fluorescent integration plasmids were then digested with SphI and integrated into the genome of ATCC 2001 by electroporation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup> to generate the fluorescently marked strains MHCg-G and MHCg-Y, respectively.</p><p id="Par22">The mutant alleles of CAGL0B02739g (CgSTE11) identified from the three evolved populations (T1, T2, and T3) were introduced into ATCC 2001 by first amplifying the partial coding sequences (~985&#x02009;bp) containing the desired mutations in CAGL0B02739g from the gDNA of T1-27G, T2-5G, or T3-24Y with primer pair TE9_F and TE9_R to generate the 1<sup>st</sup> part of the DNA fragment. The 2<sup>nd</sup> part (~367&#x02009;bp) was synthesized as a gBlock DNA fragments (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc) to remove the existing BsaI site via a single nucleotide substitution without causing an amino acid change; and was joined with the 1<sup>st</sup> part by overlapping PCR using the primer pair TE9_F and TE10_R. The partial coding sequence of the wild-type version of CAGL0B02739g was constructed in a similar way using the gDNA of ATCC 2001 as the template with the same primer pairs. The 3&#x02032; untranslated region (3&#x02032;UTR) of CAGL0B02739g was amplified from the gDNA of ATCC 2001 with primers TE11_F and TE11_R. In addition, the SAT1-FLP cassette was amplified from the plasmid yEP352-SAT1 with primers TE12_F and TE12_R. These DNA fragments were each first cloned into the entry vector pYTK001 from the Yeast Tool Kit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> to create a set of part plasmids (pMH032, pMH033, pMH034, and pMH041, pMH042, and pMH043); and then were assembled with parts from pYTK002, pYTK067, and pYTK095 to construct four cassette plasmids pMH035, pMH036, pMH037, and pMH038 that contain the replacement cassettes for mutant alleles of CAGL0B02739g from populations T1, T2, T3 and the wild-type control, respectively. These plasmid constructions follow the MoClo-derived assembly described by Lee, <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The part plasmids used in the construction of the replacement cassette plasmids were verified by Sanger sequencing. Each replacement cassette was digested from the cassette plasmids by BsmBI (Thermo scientific) and integrated into the genome of ATCC 2001 using the Easy Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II Kit (Zymo Research) following the manufacturer recommended protocol. Positive transformants were selected on nourseothricin (100&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/mL) YPD plates. The SAT1-FLP cassette was looped out spontaneously by growing the transformants in YPD medium without nourseothricin and subsequently verified by both colony PCR using primers TE25_F and TE25_R and Sanger sequencing.</p><p id="Par23">The <italic>C</italic>. <italic>glabrata ste11&#x02206;</italic> deletion strain (<italic>ste11</italic>::SAT1 <italic>his3&#x02206; leu2&#x02206; trp1&#x02206;)</italic> was a gift from Karl Kuchler at the Medical University Vienna.

The starting populations consisted of approximately equal numbers of MHCg-G and MHCg-Y strains. Three populations (T1, T2, and T3) were evolved in parallel. Each population was serially transferred daily and periodically heat-challenged following a two-phase strategy (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). During Phase I (P1), 1&#x02009;ml of cell culture after 24-hour growth was challenged with heat stress for 30&#x02009;minutes, followed by inoculation into 24&#x02009;ml of fresh growth medium for overnight recovery and growth. In Phase 2 (P2), 250&#x02009;&#x000b5;l of the overnight culture from the P1 phase was transferred into 24.75&#x02009;ml of fresh growth medium; and the cells were grown for 24&#x02009;hours to allow further recovery from the heat challenge. The two-phase strategy was repeated until the end of the evolution. During the evolution, the OD<sub>600</sub> of the populations were measured by sampling the culture before and after each transfer. Frozen stocks of the evolving populations sampled immediately before each stress challenge were prepared in 25% (v/v) glycerol and stored at &#x02212;80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for future characterizations. When a significant increase in OD<sub>600</sub> is observed after the second recovery phase, the thermotolerance of the evolving populations was measured using a modified method used for the general stress tolerance (described in the &#x0201c;Phenotypic characterizations of adaptive clones and population samples&#x0201d; section below) to confirm any improvements in hyperthermal tolerance. Briefly, the population samples were challenged with a temperature gradient starting from the current level used during evolution to 2&#x02009;&#x000b0;C above (in 1&#x02009;&#x000b0;C increment) for 30&#x02009;minutes; the remaining steps were unchanged. The selective pressure (temperature) was ramped up to the new level that led to at least a 10-fold reduction in viability compared to the control (challenged at 30&#x02009;&#x000b0;C). The relative proportions of the two subpopulations (MHCg-G and MHCg-Y) within each evolving population was measured using FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The isolation of the adaptive mutant for a given population sample was performed as follows: a minimum of 8 colonies from a given population sample were randomly chosen and their relative thermotolerance were estimated using the general stress tolerance protocol described above; the isolate with the highest heat tolerance was selected as the adaptive mutant from that population. The naming of the adaptive mutants is based on the population samples from which they were isolated and the color of the fluorescent protein expressed (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. mutant T2-5G was isolated from the GFP subpopulation from time point 5 of population T2).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Phenotypic characterizations of adaptive clones and population samples</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Survival assay</title><p id="Par25">The thermo-tolerance of population samples and isolated mutants were assessed after one-hour exposure to the temperature at which the samples were challenged at during the evolution experiment.
