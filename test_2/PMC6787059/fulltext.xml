Immunity involves adaptation, the integration of ~30-bp DNA fragments, termed prespacers, into the CRISPR array as spacers, and interference, the targeted degradation of DNA containing a protospacer. Interference-driven DNA degradation can be coupled with primed adaptation, in which spacers are acquired from DNA surrounding the targeted protospacer. Here we develop a method for strand-specific, high-throughput sequencing of DNA fragments, FragSeq, and apply this method to identify DNA fragments accumulated in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells undergoing robust primed adaptation by a type I-E or type I-F CRISPR-Cas system. The detected fragments have sequences matching spacers acquired during primed adaptation and function as spacer precursors when introduced exogenously into cells by transformation. The identified prespacers contain a characteristic asymmetrical structure that we propose is a key determinant of integration into the CRISPR array in an orientation that confers immunity.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Primed adaptation in the CRISPR-Cas system helps recognition of previously encountered sequence elements and promotes the formation of new memories.

To test this model, we developed a method for strand-specific, high-throughput sequencing of DNA fragments, FragSeq.

Because the library construction steps in FragSeq do not involve tailing&#x02014;i.e., the addition of non-templated nucleotides onto fragment ends&#x02014;the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-end sequences of the fragments can be identified with single-nucleotide resolution. We applied FragSeq to identify products of degradation in self-targeting cells undergoing primed adaptation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>, Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref> and Methods).

Alignments of the chromosomal sequences associated with the 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; ends of complementary fragments reveals the presence of a consensus 5&#x02032;-AAG-3&#x02032;/3&#x02032;-TTC-5&#x02032; PAM derived from sequences associated with the 5&#x02032; ends of 32- to 34-nt fragments and the 3&#x02032; ends of 36- to 38-nt fragments (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>).

Compared with the orientation bias in spacer acquisition observed in type I-E systems, orientation bias in type I-F systems is reversed. In particular, the non-transcribed strand of spacers acquired from the PAM-proximal region of the PPS (upstream) or PAM-distal region of the PPS (downstream) are derived from the target strand or nontarget strand, respectively in type I-F. To determine whether spacer precursors could be detected in the type I-F system, we performed FragSeq analysis in cells undergoing primed adaptation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">21</xref>).

Accumulation of spacer precursors in the type I-E system requires the functional integrity of components of interference and adaptation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) indicating that protospacer selection involves coordination between the interference machinery and adaptation machinery (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Strikingly, spacer precursors detected during primed adaptation in both type I-E and type I-F systems share an asymmetrical structure characterized by a 3&#x02032;-end overhang on the PAM-derived end. Thus, we propose that spacer precursors detected in this work are products generated during universal steps of prespacer processing in type I CRISPR&#x02013;Cas systems relying on Cas1 and Cas2 and lacking auxiliary adaptation proteins. We further propose that the asymmetrical structure of the spacer precursors detected in this work is a key determinant of the sequential integration of prespacers into the CRISPR array (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). In addition, the FragSeq method reported in this work should be applicable, essentially without modification, to identify spacer precursors that form in vivo in any CRISPR&#x02013;Cas system.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Model of primed adaptation in type I-E CRISPR&#x02013;Cas systems. <bold>a</bold> Generation of spacer precursors involves coordination between interference and adaptation.
