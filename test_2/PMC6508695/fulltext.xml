In most cases the DSB is repaired by non-homologous end joining, resulting in small nucleotide insertions or deletions that can be used to construct knockout alleles. However, these mutations do not produce the desired null result in all cases, but instead generate a similar, functionally active protein. This effect could limit the therapeutic efficiency of gene therapy strategies based on abrogating oncogene expression, and therefore needs to be considered carefully. If there is an acceptable degree of efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 delivery to cells, the key step for success lies in the effectiveness of a specific sgRNA at knocking out the oncogene, when only one sgRNA can be used. This study shows that the null effect could be increased with an sgRNA targeting the splice donor site (SDS) of the chosen exon. Following this strategy, the generation of null alleles would be facilitated in two independent ways: the probability of producing a frameshift mutation and the probability of interrupting the canonical mechanism of pre-mRNA splicing. In these contexts, we propose to improve the loss-of-function yield driving the CRISPR system at the SDS of critical exons.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Fondo de Investigaciones Sanitarias (FIS) of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)</institution></funding-source><award-id>PI17/01895</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8370-1336</contrib-id><name><surname>S&#x000e1;nchez-Mart&#x000ed;n</surname><given-names>Manuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Fondo de Investigaciones Sanitarias (FIS) of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)</institution></funding-source><award-id>PI17/01895</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4758-2151</contrib-id><name><surname>Garc&#x000ed;a-Tu&#x000f1;&#x000f3;n</surname><given-names>Ignacio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was mainly supported by a grant from the Fondo de Investigaciones Sanitarias (FIS) of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) &#x0201c;Una manera de hacer Europa&#x0201d; [grant PI17/01895 to IGT and MSM.]; Junta de Castilla y Le&#x000f3;n, Fondos FEDER [SA085U16 to JMHR]; Novartis grant; and by the Fundaci&#x000f3;n &#x0201c;Jabones para Daniel&#x0201d;.

Although CRISPR/Cas9 is similar in action and efficacy to protein-based targeted nucleases, such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs)[<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], the ease with which these reagents can be designed and tested through the construction of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) has made gene editing available to a wider variety of users and for a broader range of applications. Unlike ribozymes, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS-ODNs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), CRISPR/Cas9 works at the DNA level, where it has the advantage of providing permanent and full gene knockout, while other methods only silence genes transiently[<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. CRISPR/Cas9 cuts DNA in a sequence-specific manner with the possibility of interrupting coding sequences, thereby making it possible to turn off cancer drivers in a way that was not previously feasible in humans[<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This notable application of permanent gene disruption is based on the cellular mechanisms involved in double-stranded break (DSB) repair. Nonhomologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ) is the predominant DSB repair pathway throughout the cell cycle. Following the creation of a DSB within the coding sequence of a gene, the predominant and error-prone NHEJ pathway often results in small nucleotide insertions or deletions (indels)[<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Its great efficiency at inducing DSB has led to CRISPR/Cas9 technology gaining a reputation as the gold standard for creating null alleles <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. These null alleles can arise from NHEJ indels that trigger premature stop codons (frameshift mutation) and/or non-sense-mediated decay in the target gene, resulting in loss of function. Currently, CRISPR/Cas9 is extensively used to engineer gene knockouts in most biological systems, but due to the variable size of the NHEJ-induced indel, it is not always possible to generate a full KO in one step. When the delivery of Cas9 elements is effective, full KO generation requires off-frame mutations in both alleles, which is a matter of probability since the random nature of DNA repair gives rise to considerable heterogeneity within the cell. It entails dealing with a significant frequency of mutated cells in which the outcome of mutation could preserve the reading frame (i.e., +3 or -3 mutations)[<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A possible solution is to use two or more RNA guides to knock out the gene at several key sites in an attempt to guarantee the null result. However, a high proportion of off-targets would increase with each new sgRNA added. Conversely, more sgRNAs at the same time trigger more DSBs, which induces a stronger p53-mediated DNA damage response[<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and more complex rearrangements[<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Either way, these undesirable effects may be irrelevant in assays in which the knockout cell can be sequenced, selected and expanded, or the null allele of the animal model can be segregated. Nevertheless, there are other situations, either <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic>, in which cell selection and clone expansion are not available, and achieving high levels of knockout or gene inactivation efficiency is crucial[<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, it is important to study the key exons carefully and, more importantly, the target areas inside them, before making a selection[<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Hematological cancer therapies based on specific oncogenic silencing within primitive pluripotent stem cells may be the best example of these situations. In this pathological cell context, the highly efficient interruption of the oncogenic open reading frame (ORF) might be an effective therapeutic option. It would even be more important for those tumors directed by a single oncogenic event, as is the case for several leukemias or sarcomas, which are directed by specific fusion oncoproteins[<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A recent study of the <italic>BCR/ABL</italic> oncogene showed this gene fusion to be an ideal target for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene therapy. A CRISPR-Cas9 application truncated the specific <italic>BCR-ABL</italic> fusion (p210) abrogating its oncogenic potential, but to achieve <italic>in vivo</italic> effectiveness in a xenograft model, the authors had to select and expand the correctly edited cellular clone because some of the clones contained in-frame or non-synonymous mutations[<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, in these situations, it is essential to have not only highly efficient Cas9-sgRNA cell delivery, but also a high capacity for generating null mutations. This is especially critical for cancer oncogene suppression therapies based on disrupting driver oncogenes. If the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 reagent delivery to the cancer cell is acceptable, the key step to success lies in the effectiveness with which a specific sgRNA can knock out the oncogene. In this way, for most knockout studies in which the edited cells or mice can be selected, the sgRNA targets different positions within the chosen exon, avoiding exon boundaries. In most of these cases, the sgRNA design follows only off-target criteria, but for cases in which cellular selection is not an option and only one sgRNA can be used, the null effect could be strengthened with an sgRNA that targets splice site consensus sequences or close to them. Following this strategy, the generation of null alleles would be enhanced in two ways: by producing a frameshift mutation and by breaking the canonical mechanism of pre-mRNA splicing. In this sense, it has long been known that mutations in splice-site consensus sequences can affect pre-mRNA splicing patterns and can lead to the generation of null or deficient alleles[<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In fact, pioneering genetic studies indicated that many of the thalassemia mutations in the &#x003b2;-globin gene affect splice sites and give rise to aberrant splicing patterns[<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Recent studies have demonstrated that a splicing mutation in the STAR gene is a loss-of-function mutation that produces an aberrant protein[<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a conserved biological mechanism that degrades transcripts containing premature translation termination codons, could help secure the null effect when a DSB is induced at splice sites. In addition to transcripts derived from nonsense alleles, the substrates of the NMD pathway include pre-mRNAs that enter the cytoplasm with their introns intact[<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Several mutations of splice donor sites that cause loss of gene function have recently been identified. A novel mutation at a splice donor site that was predicted to lead to skipping of exon 10 of the PLA2G6 gene was found in a homozygous state in infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy patients. This variant has been correlated with loss of function, providing further evidence of its pathogenicity[<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Mutations in the ectodysplasin A1 gene (EDA-A1) at the splice donor site have been described in patients with hypohydrotic ectodermal dysplasia. This novel functional skipping-splicing EDA mutation was the cause of the pathological phenotype[<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Studies in a family with premature ovarian failure identified a variant that alters a splice donor site. This variant resulted in a predicted loss of function of the MCM9 gene, which is involved in homologous recombination and repair of double-stranded DNA breaks[<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Taking into account all these findings, we decided to explore the effectiveness of driving one single sgRNA targeting the splice-donor exon site (SDE-sgRNA) to increase the null allele yield.

In most cases, DSBs are typically repaired by NHEJ, resulting in indel mutations. These mutations can generate knockout alleles when CRISPR/Cas9 is directed at coding sequences, but due to the variable size of NHEJ-induced indels, generating a full KO in one step cannot always be achieved at high frequency. This could be especially critical for gene therapy approaches. If there is an acceptable degree of efficiency of delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 reagents to the target cell, the key step for success lies in the effectiveness of a specific sgRNA at knocking out the oncogene. In this context, the null effect could be increased by sgRNAs targeting the exon SD boundaries. Following this strategy, the generation of null alleles could be increased in two independent ways: by the probabilities of producing a frameshift mutation and/or breaking the canonical pre-mRNA splicing. In the present work we have demonstrated that knockout efficiency can be increased using sgRNAs targeting the exon splice donor area. The study considered the predicted informatic score (most guides with a score of &#x0003e; 75) and the cut-site of the sgRNAs. It is important to note that for SDE-sgRNAs we chose PAMs to trigger DSBs inside the coding sequence that were located no further than five nucleotides from the end of the exon.</p><p>We noted that most of the mutant alleles produced in our assays in the Baf3 and k562 cell lines correspond to small indels, indicating that the DSB is repaired by blunt-end ligation independently of sequence homology, the classic nonhomologous end joining (C-NHEJ) mechanism[<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. NGS corroborated the Sanger sequences detected and exposed new mutant alleles that are likely to be little-represented in the edited cell line. As expected, NGS and Sanger sequencing highlighted the same alleles in <italic>in vivo</italic> assays of mouse zygotes, grown to blast or of mice born from them. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis of these mutant alleles revealed a full efficiency of the null effect in SDE-sgRNA compared with IE-sgRNA. When an IE-sgRNA was used, mutant alleles with mutations preserving the reading frame were detected. To corroborate the <italic>in silico</italic> findings we Sanger-sequenced all mice born in both groups. Excluding unmutated mice, we detected color mice born from microinjected zygotes with IE-sgRNA with indels in one or more alleles. It is of particular note that we observed color mice with both alleles mutated, one of them with a frameshift mutation and the other with a mutation, indicating that some induced indels are not able to generate a frameshift mutation. By contrast, when we used a <italic>Tyr</italic> SDE-sgRNA, we detected albino or mosaic mice featuring one allele with a frameshift mutation and another with a mutation but a destroyed splice-donor site. This result demonstrates the higher null efficiency when an SDE-sgRNA is used. To determine whether this effect can be reproduced in another locus we employed the same assay but targeting the <italic>ATM</italic> and <italic>ABL</italic> loci. A similar result was obtained in both loci in human and mouse cell lines. Western blot analysis in cell clones from both groups corroborated the NGS and the results of their <italic>in silico</italic> analysis. More importantly, this approach can be efficiently used to abrogate oncogene expression. When a cancer cell is the target, a delivery strategy that can result in the expression of Cas9 and an oncogene-specific sgRNA in all infected cells is desirable. This is especially critical for <italic>in vitro</italic> gene therapy where the expansion processes of a selected edited cell are not available. Similarly, it is crucial for <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches in cancer therapies based on disrupting a driver oncogene. If the efficiency of delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 reagents to the cancer cell is acceptable, the key step for success lies in the effectiveness of a specific sgRNA at knocking out the oncogene. In most of these cases, the designs are based solely on off-target criteria. However, for those cases in which cellular selection is not an option and only one sgRNA can be used, the null effect could be increased with an sgRNA targeting the exon boundary. Various strategies at different molecular levels[<xref rid="pone.0216674.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] have been employed to treat malignant diseases in recent decades, such as specific drug inhibitors acting at the protein level, gene suppression therapies at the mRNA level, and genome-editing nucleases at the DNA level. CRISPR/Cas9 works has the advantage of providing permanent and full gene knockout, and following this strategy, we abrogated p210 (BCR/ABLp210) oncoprotein expression in the K562 cell line. Using this approach, pools of K562 edited cells electroporated with SDE-sgRNAs or IE-sgRNA were studied. The loss of p210 expression in K562 cells with SDE-sgRNA resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis levels. Thus, this strategy could be adopted for gene therapy in cases for which cell selection is not an option and the delivery Cas9 vector only allows the accommodation of one sgRNA.</p><sec id="sec009"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Genome-editing nucleases, like the popular CRISPR/Cas9, enable knockout cell lines and null zygotes to be generated by inducing site-specific DSBs within a genome. In most cases, when a DNA template is not present, the DSB is repaired by non-homologous end joining, resulting in small nucleotide insertions or deletions that can be used to construct knockout alleles. However, for several reasons, these mutations do not produce the desired null result in all cases, giving rise to a similar but functionally active protein. This undesirable effect could limit the efficiency of gene therapy strategies based on abrogating oncogene expression by CRISPR/Cas9 and should therefore be borne in mind. The use of an sgRNA-targeting splice donor site could improve the null result for <italic>in vivo</italic> gene therapies. This strategy could be adopted to abrogate <italic>in vivo</italic> the oncogenic activity involved in tumor maintenance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Material &#x00026; methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study followed Spanish and European Union guidelines for animal experimentation (RD 1201/05, RD 53/2013 and 86/609/CEE respectively).
