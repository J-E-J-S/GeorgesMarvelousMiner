Thus, plant-colonizing microorganisms&#x02014;the plant microbiota&#x02014;are exposed to direct influence by the soil&#x02019;s phosphorus (P) content itself as well as to the indirect effects of soil P on the microbial niches shaped by the plant. The individual contribution of these factors to plant microbiota assembly remains unknown. To disentangle these direct and indirect effects, we planted PSR-deficient <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants in a long-term managed soil P gradient and compared the composition of their shoot and root microbiota to wild-type plants across different P concentrations. PSR-deficiency had a larger effect on the composition of both bacterial and fungal plant-associated microbiota than soil P concentrations in both roots and shoots.</p><p>To dissect plant&#x02013;microbe interactions under variable P conditions, we conducted a microbiota reconstitution experiment. Using a 185-member bacterial synthetic community (SynCom) across a wide P concentration gradient in an agar matrix, we demonstrated a shift in the effect of bacteria on the plant from a neutral or positive interaction to a negative one, as measured by rosette size. This phenotypic shift was accompanied by changes in microbiota composition: the genus <italic>Burkholderia</italic> was specifically enriched in plant tissue under P starvation. Through a community drop-out experiment, we demonstrated that in the absence of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> from the SynCom, plant shoots accumulated higher ortophosphate (Pi) levels than shoots colonized with the full SynCom but only under Pi starvation conditions. Therefore, Pi-stressed plants are susceptible to colonization by latent opportunistic competitors found within their microbiome, thus exacerbating the plant&#x02019;s Pi starvation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>This study shows that plants' response to phosphate starvation has more influence on plant microbiota than does the phosphate concentration itself; these changes are not necessarily beneficial for the plant, and can even exacerbate the phosphate starvation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>National Science Foundation INSPIRE</institution></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1343020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3199-8654</contrib-id><name><surname>Dangl</surname><given-names>Jeffery L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>DOE-USDA Feedstock</institution></funding-source><award-id>DE-SC001043</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3199-8654</contrib-id><name><surname>Dangl</surname><given-names>Jeffery L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>NIH NRSA</institution></funding-source><award-id>F32-GM117758</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4770-0402</contrib-id><name><surname>Finkel</surname><given-names>Omri M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1917270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3199-8654</contrib-id><name><surname>Dangl</surname><given-names>Jeffery L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>-</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3199-8654</contrib-id><name><surname>Dangl</surname><given-names>Jeffery L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>U.S. National Institute of Health NRSA (grant number F32-GM117758-02).

Only when comparing the low P versus the P-supplemented low+P samples is there a discernible difference in both plant transcriptome and shoot Pi accumulation, which correlates to a stronger effect on microbiota composition. This suggests that bioavailable Pi added to the soil is quickly consumed, and short-term amendments are needed in order to detect changes. A similar short-term fertilization approach was successfully applied in the work by Fabia&#x00144;ska and colleagues [<xref rid="pbio.3000534.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], using soils from a different long-term experimental site.</p><p>As opposed to in vitro defined transcriptomes [<xref rid="pbio.3000534.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], here, <italic>phf1</italic> and <italic>phr1 phl1</italic> plants, although each having a distinct transcriptional profile, were impaired in the response of a core set of genes (Cluster 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000534.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) to low P.

A paralogous discrepancy was also observed in the work by Hiruma and colleagues [<xref rid="pbio.3000534.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], in which both <italic>phf1</italic> and <italic>phr1 phl1</italic> were impaired in their response to a plant growth promoting fungus, whereas only <italic>phr1 phl1</italic> but not <italic>phf1</italic> was impaired in P translocation to the shoot, raising the speculation that PHF1 is needed for fine, rather than bulk, P translocation within the plant. Our results support this idea and raise a similar speculation that PHF1-guided transporters are involved in fine grained phosphate translocation within the plant toward Pi sensing tissues.</p><p>An additional apparent departure from the axenically defined PSR transcriptional signature is that only 7 of the genes that were induced in wt plants under low Pi conditions overlapped with the list of 193 axenically defined PSR genes we used as a reference. It is notable, however, that despite the difference in plant age and environmental conditions between our soil and axenic agar systems, the agar-defined transcriptomic signature is detectable in the soil system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000534.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000534.s023">S1 Data</xref>) and vice versa: the signature of the 123 genes identified in our soil system is detectable on agar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000534.s006">S6C Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000534.s023">S1 Data</xref>).

A recent report of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> planted in a 60-year-long annual P fertilization gradient (the same soil used in the current study) showed a modest P effect on plant microbiome composition [<xref rid="pbio.3000534.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Previously, we showed that PSR mutants in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> have different bacterial microbiomes in Pi replete conditions [<xref rid="pbio.3000534.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and a recent publication showed that PSR mutants had a slightly altered fungal microbiome in Pi-replete but not in Pi-depleted conditions [<xref rid="pbio.3000534.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Here, we analyzed fungi and bacteria side by side and demonstrated a pronounced effect of PSR impairment on both bacterial and fungal components of the plant microbiota. We noted an intriguing difference that emerged in the patterns of community assembly between bacteria and fungi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000534.s003">S3A, S3B, S3D and S3E Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000534.s023">S1 Data</xref>). The bacterial microbiota composition is strongly dependent on the soil bacterial community composition, whereas changes to the fungal microbiota are uncoupled from changes to the soil fungal community composition. This indicates that the plant is markedly more selective as to the fungi allowed to proliferate in its tissue than it is with bacteria. The observation that much of the modulation of the plant&#x02019;s fungal microbiota is mediated by the bacterial microbiota itself [<xref rid="pbio.3000534.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] may also contribute to this complex pattern. Our results show that impairment of PSR genes profoundly affects the composition of the plant microbiota, independently of P conditions, and that observed shifts in root-derived microbial communities may not be a result of sensitivity to P concentrations but rather a response to PSR regulation in the hosts. The mechanism by which PSR regulation affects microbiota assembly is not fully understood. On one hand, PSR and plant immunity have been shown to be transcriptionally linked [<xref rid="pbio.3000534.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. On the other, Pi depletion drastically changes the root&#x02019;s exudate profiles [<xref rid="pbio.3000534.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000534.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000534.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000534.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], which have been shown to play a critical role in plant microbiota assembly [<xref rid="pbio.3000534.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000534.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. It is likely that both factors contribute to shifts in microbiota composition. Evidently, however, the <italic>Burkholderia</italic> plant-enrichment in our SynCom occurs via a PSR-independent mechanism.</p><p>Our SynCom, comprising 185 genome-sequenced endophytic bacterial isolates, was designed to resemble a natural bacterial community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000534.g004">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000534.s023">S1 Data</xref>). The community assembly patterns shown for this system are highly reproducible, demonstrating that microbiome assembly is largely a deterministic process. The reproducibility and editability of this system is attractive for detailed mechanistic study of the processes that determine community assembly and its influence on plant phenotype and fitness. From within this SynCom, the genus <italic>Burkholderia</italic> emerges as a PSR-independent, low Pi-responsive taxon. We compared the effect of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> on shoot Pi accumulation from within a full SynCom (a realistic proxy for the bacterial community) to that of the full SynCom lacking <italic>Burkholderia</italic>, a strategy akin to knocking-out a gene of interest, also recently applied in the work by Dur&#x000e1;n and colleagues [<xref rid="pbio.3000534.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The control treatment for this type of approach is the full SynCom, whereas in a plant&#x02013;bacterium binary association experiment it would typically be sterile conditions. Because both sterile conditions and binary association are strong deviations from conditions that may be encountered in the field, the results of binary association experiments may be correspondingly distorted. Using the drop-out approach, we expect to see more subtle differences, because the microbial load on the plant does not change much, but also that these differences be more relevant to the field&#x02014;an expectation that is yet to be empirically tested. Our observation that dropping <italic>Burkholederia</italic> out of the SynCom increased shoot Pi in Pi-limiting conditions (50 &#x003bc;M Pi) but not in Pi-replete conditions (1,000 &#x003bc;M Pi) suggests that strains in this genus shift their relationship with the plant from a seeming commensal to a competitor/pathogen. Having ruled out PSR-dependent processes, another plausible explanation for <italic>Burkholderia</italic> enrichment patterns is that when Pi is limiting in the media, the plant becomes a source of Pi for the bacteria and strains with an enhanced ability to utilize plant-derived organic Pi or polyphosphate have an advantage under these conditions. Strains belonging to the genus <italic>Burkholderia</italic> have been shown to be particularly efficient at polyphosphate accumulation at pH 5.5, which is similar to the pH we used in our media [<xref rid="pbio.3000534.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>Shifts in microbiota composition that accompany PSR are either adaptive to the plant or reflect opportunistic strategies by bacteria [<xref rid="pbio.3000534.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000534.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Under the former hypothesis, microbes recruited by the plant under Pi stress provide the plants with an advantage vis-a-vis coping with this stress, whereas under the latter, opportunistic microbes might be making a bad situation worse for the plant. In the case of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> in our SynCom, results support the latter hypothesis. <italic>Burkholderia</italic> contribute to depletion of shoot Pi stores, only under Pi-limiting conditions. However, plant-adaptive microbial recruitment under low Pi has been shown to occur as well [<xref rid="pbio.3000534.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The fact that bacteria responding to PSR genes are not a monophyletic group in soil indicates that multiple mechanisms are involved in community assembly. It is likely that these mechanisms encompass both plant-adaptive and opportunistic strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec012"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Soil P gradient experiment</title><sec id="sec014"><title>Collection of soil from field site</title><p>Soil used in this experiment was collected from the long-term Pi fertilization field (&#x0201c;Field D&#x0201d;) trial at the Julius K&#x000fc;hn Experimental Station at Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg (51&#x000b0;29&#x02032;45.6&#x02032;&#x02032;N, 11&#x000b0;59&#x02032;33.3&#x02032;&#x02032;E) [<xref rid="pbio.3000534.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000534.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].

Because we were interested in identifying DEGs among any pair of levels (6 levels) of the group variable (e.g., Col-0_lowP versus Col-0_low+P) we performed a likelihood ratio test (LRT) between a model containing the group variable and a reduced model containing only the intercept.
