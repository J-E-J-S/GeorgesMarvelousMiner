Synthetic long read technologies have existed in various forms as a means of reducing complexity and resolving repeats since the outset of genome assembly. Recently, technologies that combine subhaploid pools of high molecular weight DNA with barcoding on a massive scale have brought new efficiencies to sample preparation and data generation. When combined with inexpensive light shotgun sequencing, the resulting data can be used to scaffold large genomes. The protocol is efficient enough to consider routinely for even the largest genomes. Conifers represent the largest reference genome projects executed to date. The largest of these is that of the conifer <italic>Pinus lambertiana</italic> (sugar pine), with a genome size of 31&#x000a0;billion&#x000a0;bp. In this paper, we report on the molecular and computational protocols for scaffolding the <italic>P. lambertiana</italic> genome using the library technology from 10&#x000d7; Genomics. At 247,000&#x000a0;bp, the NG50 of the existing reference sequence is the highest scaffold contiguity among the currently published conifer assemblies; this new assembly&#x02019;s NG50 is 1.94&#x000a0;million&#x000a0;bp, an eightfold increase.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>10&#x000d7; genomics</kwd><kwd>conifer genomes</kwd><kwd>genome assembly</kwd><kwd>sugar pine</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="20"/><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>As a class, conifer genome reference sequences represent the largest genome assemblies accomplished to date. Recent and active conifer genome projects have target genomes far exceeding that of the human genome (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Birol <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Nystedt <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Neale <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Warren <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Stevens <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). Most of the size of conifer genomes derives from insertions of transposable elements (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Nystedt <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Stevens <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). Their large scale and repetitive nature make them an important assembly benchmark, and a target for technological improvements. The largest genome project to date is that of the white pine <italic>Pinus lambertiana</italic> (sugar pine), with a genome size of 31&#x000a0;Gbp (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Stevens <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>).</p><p>Complexity reduction played an important role in the initial assembly of <italic>P. lambertiana</italic>. A gymnosperm megagametophyte (MGP) is maternally derived tissue found within each seed containing the same haploid genome that is contributed to the diploid zygote (embryo). The haploid MGP contains enough DNA for creation of a set of size-selected paired end Illumina libraries. These can be sequenced to sufficient depth to support the creation of a high quality, error corrected, read set forming the basis for <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Zimin <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Stevens <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). In this paper, we present a protocol for scaffolding a conifer genome applying the new library technology, described in detail below, from 10&#x000d7; genomics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.10xgenomics.com">www.10xgenomics.com</ext-link>). Because DNA requirements are small, the protocol can be implemented using DNA from a single conifer megagametophyte. Application of this new protocol to <italic>P. lambertiana</italic> results in an eightfold improvement to the scaffold contiguity of the colossal genome. For most MGPs, extracted DNA will be of sufficient quality and quantity that the protocol presented here can be used in parallel with methods for generating standard size selected paired end libraries (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Zimin <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>).</p><p>The idea of reducing the complexity of the assembly problem by simplifying the target has been around since the early genome projects. The shotgun sequencing and assembly of cloned DNA was the original method of constructing &#x0201c;synthetic long reads&#x0201d;. On a larger scale, the shotgun sequencing and assembly of fosmid pools to create &#x0201c;synthetic long reads&#x0201d; has also been used effectively for the assembly of complex genomes (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Duitama <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>) and proposed for conifers (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Alexeyenko <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). Alternatively, Illumina&#x02019;s TruSeq Synthetic Long Read technology (formerly Moleculo) uses shotgun sequencing and assembly of amplified high molecular weight (HMW) DNA to construct synthetic long reads (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Voskoboynik <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). These protocols suffer a common practical limitation on the number of independent subhaploid pools that can be generated. Contiguity information is extracted from each pool by deep sequencing and assembly to generate synthetic long reads, which are useful as inputs to another assembly.</p><p>Recently, it has become practical to replace the deep sequence coverage requirement of synthetic long reads, with a deep subhaploid pool coverage. We follow <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Kuleshov <italic>et al.</italic> (2016)</xref> and refer to the resulting data as synthetic long read &#x0201c;clouds.&#x0201d; When aligned to a genome, each long DNA fragment is represented by a low-density cloud of clustered reads. Currently, few methods exist for implementing deep pool coverage.</p><p>The GemCode system from 10&#x000d7; Genomics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.10xgenomics.com">www.10xgenomics.com</ext-link>) utilizes a combination of proprietary hardware and reagents to produce Illumina sequencing libraries that preserve the long-range linkage information present in large DNA molecules. The two key components of their platform are (1) a microfluidic device designed to produce emulsified droplets each containing a small &#x0201c;pool&#x0201d; of HMW DNA fragments, and (2) distinct indices drawn from a massive set (&#x0223c;750,000) of 14-bp oligonucleotide &#x0201c;barcodes&#x0201d; (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Each library begins with &#x0223c;1&#x000a0;ng of input DNA, which is partitioned into &#x0223c;200,000 barcoded pools. These droplet partitions are proprietarily named GEMs, for Gel bead in EMulsion. Because the amount of partitioned DNA is small (&#x0003c;10&#x000a0;fg), for genomes of sufficient size, each GEM will contain a collection of genomic fragments comprising a small fraction of the haploid genome. Multiple libraries can be used to further increase the total number of barcoded pools generated. High quality linkage information is contingent upon HMW input DNA. One advantage of the 10&#x000d7; Genomics protocol, in this regard, is a relatively small amount of input DNA (&#x0223c;1&#x000a0;ng) recommended.<fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(Top) Construction of synthetic long read clouds with 10&#x000d7; Genomics technology. (A) HMW DNA is prepared from a single haploid sugar pine MGP. (B) Within the instrument emulsion droplets are used to pool HMW DNA. A barcode containing bead in each droplet is used for indexing the pools. During subsequent thermal cycling the bead dissolves and the input DNA fragments act as templates for primer extension by the barcoded random hexamers (blue). All extension products within a droplet contain the same 14&#x000a0;bp barcode (magenta). After completion of primer extension cycles the emulsion is &#x0201c;broken,&#x0201d; pooled extension products are physically sheared to subkilobase fragments, and p7 and p5 adapters are added to the barcoded terminal fragments by ligation and enrichment PCR. Final molecules have the standard configuration and adapter sequences of Illumina dual-index, paired-end libraries, except that i5 is 14&#x000a0;bp instead of 8&#x000a0;bp. The random hexamer sequence (Nmer) is trimmed from the start of read one during data processing. (C) The oligo-containing gel bead (colored dots) within each droplet contains a single 14&#x000a0;bp barcode and multiple long DNA fragments (wavy lines) that serve as templates for generation of library fragments and then reads (short bicolored bars). Different droplets may contain identical gel beads increasing the effective size of the pool. All reads with the same barcode form an effective pool. (D) Alignments to a contig will assign the contig to one or more pools. Overlap graph nodes are defined in windows at the contig ends. Because there are a large number of distinct pools (barcodes), any two nodes are unlikely to belong to the same two (or more) pools by chance. However, one shared barcode is common. (Bottom) Scaffolding with synthetic long read clouds and fragScaff. (E) For each node, the read group assignments for that node are compared with the read group assignments for every other node and the fraction of read groups shared between them (their &#x0201c;shared fraction&#x0201d;) is calculated. (F) A typical distribution of shared fraction for a node in our data. For each node, a normal distribution is fitted to the observed shared fraction data. Link scores for each ordered pair of nodes are computed by taking the negative log<sub>10</sub> probability of the observed shared fraction under the fitted normal distribution. After all pairwise link scores are calculated, a global link score threshold is determined. In our example, the pair (n, n&#x02032;) shared one barcode and are below the threshold, while the pair (n, n&#x02032;&#x02032;) shared &#x0003e;1 and are above. (F) Pairs of nodes with a score exceeding the global link score threshold become edges in an overlap graph with a weight corresponding to the score. (G) Layout linearizes the weighted graph and is accomplished by greedy algorithm described in (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adey <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). From each linearized subgraph the consensus scaffold is determined by concatenating component scaffolds.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1563f1"/></fig></p><p>The first application for this data was haplotype phasing, which relies on a reference genome alignment to directly demarcate the long (linking) DNA fragments from aligned reads. This follows similar implementations by others using related (but lower-plexity) data types (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Peters <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Amini <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). Utilizing read clouds for assembly relies on a property of the interactions between &#x0003e;1 barcode. For the subhaploid dilution achieved, multiple DNA fragments have the same barcode, hence any given barcode is associated with many parts of the genome. However, the dilution into pools is of sufficient magnitude to ensure that coincidental overlap between two barcodes is rare. This implies that two (or more) barcodes will intersect at a unique location. Similarly, if two or more barcodes are shared between unlinked sequences, they are likely in close proximity to each other. Few programs exist that will utilize this information for genome assembly (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adey <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Kuleshov <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). To create our new assembly we used the <italic>fragScaff</italic> program from <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adey <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref>. <italic>fragScaff</italic> implements a modification of the classic overlap&#x02013;layout&#x02013;consensus paradigm (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Myers 2005</xref>). Specifically, <italic>fragScaff</italic> uses a link score to define overlaps and build an overlap graph. Each edge in this graph has a weight. The layout step is accomplished by finding a new simpler graph, which, when traversed, defines a scaffold. The consensus step concatenates component scaffold sequences with spacers.</p><p>The primary input to <italic>fragScaff</italic> is a bam formatted alignment file. In the case of our data, each aligned read is annotated with a 14&#x000a0;bp barcode. Sequencing may be single read, for our scaffolding protocol, the additional read in paired-end sequencing is used only to help resolve alignment location. The other important input is a bed formatted annotation of repetitive regions of the genome, which is used to establish the subset of trusted alignments. We address methods for creating this annotation as well as setting the most important assembly parameters in this paper.</p><p>Our results build on the results of <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Mostovoy <italic>et al.</italic> (2016)</xref> for the human genome. We demonstrate the utility and scalability of this approach, and establish a protocol for the much larger, more repetitive, and more fragmented genomes of conifers. We validate our approach using empirical estimates of the type&#x000a0;1 and type&#x000a0;2 error rates in linking.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Library construction and sequencing</title><p>DNA was extracted from a single sugar pine MGP using the method previously reported in <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Zimin <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> for obtaining HMW DNA from pine needles.

The size-selected library showed a substantial improvement in the overall distribution of fragment sizes and physical coverage (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Subsequent effort focused on SPX2, and three additional size-selected libraries (SPX3, SPX4, and SPX5).

To compensate for this we subtracted one window width from all our estimates. To estimate density, the total number of reads contained in the read clouds defined for each library was divided by the sum of the read cloud lengths in kilobase for that library to determine the aligned reads per kilobase. To estimate genome wide physical coverage, the observed physical coverage from the subset of larger scaffolds was scaled to the complete genome using the ratio of all aligned reads to reads aligned to the larger scaffolds.

Subsequent alignment to the genome yielded 1,226,556,973 aligned reads containing valid barcodes.

We opted to use the most contiguous elements of our existing genome assembly as the internal control, and to generate a corresponding test dataset <italic>in silico</italic>. Specifically, we began with all 10,403 elements whose total length (including gaps) was &#x02265;500&#x000a0;kb, and broke these into 157,873 pieces that were exactly 50&#x000a0;kb in length (excluding Ns) with the exception of the 3&#x02032; terminal pieces. These fragmented scaffolds then became the input data for <italic>fragScaff</italic>. The original order and orientation of the 50&#x000a0;kb pieces allowed us to evaluate the performance of our scaffolding procedure under different parameter settings. We refer to these assemblies as &#x0201c;calibration runs&#x0201d; since we used them to evaluate parameters for our final assembly of unmodified data.</p><p>This methodology relies on two plausible assumptions: (1) the existing assembly for elements &#x0003e;500&#x000a0;kb in length is essentially correct and representative; (2) the performance of the methodology for joining 50&#x000a0;kb elements will be indicative of the performance for the overall genome. It is also noteworthy that, because the haploid genome of our megagametophyte is not identical to the reference genome sequence, there is the possibility that genuine structural variation is a source of error.</p><p>Runs were performed in four stages: (1) bam file parsing, which included definition of nodes and barcode hits to each node; (2) shared fraction calculations, which was the most computationally intensive step; and (3) graph based layout and (4) consensus. We focused our efforts on evaluating and optimizing the exposed <italic>fragScaff</italic> parameters and procedures that directly effect the definition of nodes and edges in initial graph construction.</p><sec id="s13"><title>Optimizing repeat exclusion:</title><p>The <italic>P. lambertiana</italic> genome is highly repetitive. Reads originating from repetitive regions obfuscate scaffolding because their genomic locations are ambiguous. Hence, the fragScaff protocol recommends the specification of an exclusion file in BED format. Regions specified in this file will be excluded from nodes so that reads aligning within them are not considered. For the <italic>P. lambertiana</italic> genome, a repeat mask file masks 79% of the genome (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Stevens <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). We ran a parameter-calibration run using this exclusion file with default parameters and estimated a type&#x000a0;I error of 5.84%, and an even higher type&#x000a0;II error of 25.73%, <italic>i.e.</italic>, only 74.27% of expected joins were made.</p><p>An alternative approach was to rely on BWA mapping quality estimates to annotate repetitive regions. For each alignment, BWA estimates a confidence in the location, in the form of a Phred transformed probability that the locus is correct (mapping quality or MAPQ). By default, the program only considers alignments with a mapping quality &#x0003e;10. We created an additional exclusion file based on the mapping quality estimates. This was done by collecting all alignments with MAPQ &#x02264; 10, converting the alignment coordinates to BED format (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>). This produced a less restrictive (more targeted) exclusion file. Similarly, using this exclusion file in a parameter-calibration run, we found that it improved type&#x000a0;I error to 4.92%, while the type&#x000a0;II error rate and contiguity were substantially improved: 84.80% of expected joins were made.</p></sec><sec id="s14"><title>Optimizing the window size for defining graph nodes:</title><p>We evaluated two settings for the number of unmasked bases defining an overlap graph node (&#x02013;<italic>E</italic> parameter), the default value of 5000&#x000a0;bp, and larger value of 10,000&#x000a0;bp, which would incorporate more barcodes. In both cases the maximum node length (&#x02013;<italic>o</italic>) was kept at 50,000&#x000a0;bp, and the minimum input element length (&#x02013;<italic>m</italic>) was set to 5000&#x000a0;bp. The median number of barcodes per node increased from 26 to 39. This increase improved the number of valid links made. Upon updating the value of &#x02013;<italic>E</italic> from 5000 to 10,000, our estimated type&#x000a0;II error rate dropped from 15.20 to 13.52%.

By examining the results of our parameter calibration runs, we were able to modify the value of the (&#x02013;<italic>D</italic>) parameter leading to improved type&#x000a0;II error rates relative to its default setting. Using calibration data, we estimated the likely impact of adjustments to the type&#x000a0;I error and type&#x000a0;II error rates. This led to updating of the parameter to filter the top 1.5% of the distribution, rejecting nodes with 98 or more read groups. Comparing similar calibration runs before and after parameter update, we observe a reduction in type&#x000a0;II error rate from 13.52 to 8.69%, while type&#x000a0;I error rate stayed relatively contained (5.19% <italic>vs.</italic> 4.85%, respectively).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s16"><title>Final assembly and validation</title><p>The production fragScaff assembly of all <italic>P. lambertiana</italic> v1.0 elements &#x02265;5&#x000a0;kb resulted in an eightfold improvement in scaffold <italic>N</italic>50 relative to the input (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>).

Like most initial assemblies of megagenomes, large-scale scaffolding is the obvious next step toward a more contiguous and serviceable resource. In this paper, we report the generation of deep physical coverage from subhaploid pools using a single molecule sequencing technology (10&#x000d7; Genomics). Relatively light sequencing of the resulting libraries was needed to obtain a substantial eightfold increase to the weighted scaffold contiguity.</p><p>System performance with this technology is highly dependent on the quality, especially the size distribution, of the input DNA. In particular, the range of the linkage information produced is contingent upon the distribution of molecular weight of the starting DNA. We demonstrated that sufficient HMW DNA could be obtained from a single conifer megagametophyte for this scaffolding. What was surprising was that the majority (nearly 99%) of the DNA extracted from the single megagametophyte was not actually needed since the input requirements of library construction are so extremely modest. Thus this remaining DNA could be used for additional single-molecular physical coverage.
