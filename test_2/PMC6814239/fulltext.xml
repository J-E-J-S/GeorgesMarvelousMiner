Exome sequencing became a widespread tool to further study the genomic basis of Mendelian diseases. In an effort to identify pathogenic variants, reject benign variants and better predict variant effects in downstream analysis, the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) published a set of criteria in 2015. While there are multiple publicly available software&#x02019;s available to assign the ACMG criteria, most of them do not take into account multi-sample variant calling formats. Here we present a tool for assessment and prioritisation in exome studies (TAPES, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/a-xavier/tapes">https://github.com/a-xavier/tapes</ext-link>), an open-source tool designed for small-scale exome studies. TAPES can quickly assign ACMG criteria using ANNOVAR or VEP annotated files and implements a model to transform the categorical ACMG criteria into a continuous probability, allowing for a more accurate classification of pathogenicity or benignity of variants. In addition, TAPES can work with cohorts sharing a common phenotype by utilising a simple enrichment analysis, requiring no controls as an input as well as providing powerful filtering and reporting options. Finally, benchmarks showed that TAPES outperforms available tools to detect both pathogenic and benign variants, while also integrating the identification of enriched variants in study cohorts compared to the general population, making it an ideal tool to evaluate a smaller cohort before using bigger scale studies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>New sequencing techniques allow researchers to study the genetic basis of diseases. Predicting the effect of genetic variants is critical to understand the mechanisms underlying disease. Available software can predict how pathogenic a variant is, but do not take into account the abundance of a variants in a cohort.

It has become easy to annotate the ever-increasing amount of variants identified by such methods, using tools such as VEP [<xref rid="pcbi.1007453.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], snpEff [<xref rid="pcbi.1007453.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] or ANNOVAR [<xref rid="pcbi.1007453.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These tools help researchers to better predict the downstream effect of a variant and give insight, for example, on the frequency of the mutation in the general population, the impact on proteins or in-silico predictions of pathogenicity.</p><p>In 2015, the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) published a set of criteria to assess the probability of a variant pathogenicity, classifying them into five categories [<xref rid="pcbi.1007453.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], from benign to pathogenic, facilitating downstream analysis.</p><p>Since then, tools have been developed to assess individual variant pathogenicity using the ACMG criteria (such as CharGer [<xref rid="pcbi.1007453.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and Intervar [<xref rid="pcbi.1007453.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]) but they do not have the ability to take into account the frequency of variants in a cohort. The categorical nature of the ACMG criteria also leaves a lot of variants classified as &#x0201c;a variant of unknown significance&#x0201d;.</p><p>Here, we present TAPES, an open-source tool to both assess and prioritise variants by pathogenicity. TAPES can assign the ACMG criteria and by using one of the first implementations of the model described in Tavtigian <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007453.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], providing a more nuanced and easy to understand estimated probability for a variant to be either pathogenic or benign, thus transforming categorical classification into a more linear prediction. Our goal during development was first to create a simple tool that can better predict pathogenicity and reject benign variants, and then to assess a cohort sharing a phenotype by detecting enriched variants compared to the general population without the need of control samples. In addition, we focused on providing simple yet powerful reporting and filtering systems, while allowing pathway analysis of pathogenic mutations, gene-burden calculations and per-sample reporting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Design and implementation</title><sec id="sec003"><title>ANNOVAR interface and annotated variant file</title><p>TAPES sorting option can be used with both ANNOVAR and VEP annotated variant calling files (VCF).

The gene burden score is calculated by summing the probability of pathogenicity of a specific variant multiplied by the number of individuals with that genotype in the cohort.</p><disp-formula id="pcbi.1007453.e003"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1007453.e003.jpg" id="pcbi.1007453.e003g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M3"><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="4pt"/><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="4pt"/><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo stretchy="false">&#x02211;</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>&#x000d7;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></disp-formula><p>Calculated for each gene, where <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = the probability of pathogenicity of the variant and <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = Number of samples affected by the variant.

They leverage this model along with publicly available variant population frequencies to provide more accurate predictions of variant pathogenicity. Additionally, this software provides a comprehensive list of both reporting and analysis options.</p><p>MAJOR CODE PROBLEMS:</p><p>- Code doesn't seem to have any tests or automated way to run them: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/a-xavier/tapes">https://github.com/a-xavier/tapes</ext-link>. Please add tests (preferrably using a testing framework such as PyTest) that minimally take advantage of your toy datasets that covers most of your functionality. Integration with a free and automated continuous integration environment like Travis would also be highly recommended. Once tests are in place, potentialy using branches to provide a more stable development path may aid development</p><p>- Toy example provided doesn't work natively or within a virtualenv:</p><p>- python3 tapes.py sort -i ./Example_Output/input.csv -o ./Toy_dataset/ --tab --by_gene --by_sample --enrichr --disease "autosomal dominant" --kegg "Pathways in cancer":</p><p>No acmg_db path given and no db_config.json found</p><p>Default is: /home/ubuntu/repositories/tapes/acmg_db</p><p>***TAPES: SORT***</p><p>2019-07-15 10:37:05.....Output type: FOLDER</p><p>Traceback (most recent call last):</p><p>File "tapes.py", line 309, in &#x0003c;module&#x0003e;</p><p>main()</p><p>File "tapes.py", line 164, in main</p><p>output_prefix = args.output.split('\\\\')[-2]</p><p>IndexError: list index out of range</p><p>MINOR CODE FEEDBACK</p><p>- I would put code that is not top-level in a `src` or `source` directory.</p><p>- While the Manual is fine as a PDF, long-term maintenance might be easier if it is in markdown. It can be further extrapolated using something like Read the Docs or other services.</p><p>MINOR EDITS:</p><p>- line 25: should be: "share the same phenotype" , missing "the"</p><p>- line 27: I think it reads better to say "Benchmarks showed that TAPES outperforms avaialable tools"</p><p>- line 34: "Available software can predict" drop "'s"</p><p>- line 90: "individuals affected" and "number of individuals", individuals I believe should be plural in both cases</p><p>- line 96: "very vare variants" I believe variants should be plural</p><p>- line 134: "cohort are in the class are probably" , missing "are"</p><p>- line 137-139: This is not a complete sentence.</p><p>- Figure 1: Charger should be "CharGer" in your legend</p><p>MINOR QUESTIONS:</p><p>- In this model there are no controls, which is novel. I'm mildly curious if it can be shown that providing controls offers little or no statistical benefit over the publily available variant frequencies.</p><p>- A minor discussion of why the CharGer Scores were so simlar to the TAPES probability model might be useful in context of Figure 1.</p><p>Reviewer #2: The article "TAPES: a tool for assessment and prioritisation in exome</p><p>studies" describes a new software tool to identify pathogenic and</p><p>benign variants. The aim described is very promising. However, I think</p><p>the clarity of both the paper and the documentation could be improved.</p><p>I will first comment on my experience with the software and then on</p><p>the paper. (This review is writen in MarkDown format, so it can be</p><p>converted to html or other format to see code section.)</p><p>## Comments on the software package.</p><p>I cloned the repository from GitHub, and could install it. Then I ran</p><p>into a few problems.</p><p>1. I found a bug in `t_func.py` on line 3197 that made the program</p><p>crash</p><p>```</p><p>with gzip.open(os.path.join(acmg_db_path, 'repeat_dict.{}.gz'.format(assembly)), "r") as dj:</p><p>```</p><p>Correcting the line to the following solved the issue.</p><p>```</p><p>with gzip.open(os.path.join(acmg_db_path, 'repeat_dict.{}.gz'.format(assembly)), "rt") as dj:</p><p>```</p><p>2. It was not clear at installation that I should install annovar to</p><p>be able to use tapes. I have found this information later in the</p><p>manual.</p><p>3. After installing annovar I needed to run</p><p>`python3 tapes.py db -s -A annovar` and</p><p>`python3 tapes.py db -b annovar` before I could annotate vcf</p><p>files. These commands were only mentioned at the end of the manual.</p><p>4. I did not manage to find a way to start with a vcf file, annotate</p><p>it and finally obtain ACMG classification. I think a tutorial and an</p><p>example dataset (starting from vcf files) would be valuable additions.</p><p>5. I would suggest to add a workflow diagram both to the manual and to</p><p>the paper to make it clear what kind of steps are needed and what</p><p>are the potential input and output files.</p><p>6. I could not identify what was the input file used for the analysis</p><p>shown in the paper, so I could not check whether it is</p><p>reproducible.</p><p>7. The program does not always produce the expected file name or it</p><p>does create the expected file, but does not log it</p><p>correctly. I think the code needs to be checked more thoroughly.</p><p>8. Please create a release for the publication version of the package</p><p>so people can know which version/status of the software was used</p><p>for the publication (This can be done at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/a-xavier/tapes/releases">https://github.com/a-xavier/tapes/releases</ext-link>).</p><p>9. A docker image is always a nice addition, to make sure that</p><p>everything is specified as it should be, and there are no problems</p><p>due to difference in the software environment. It is also a good</p><p>way to test, how a software can be installed in a new environment.</p><p>## Comments on the paper</p><p>I have found several typos and grammatically mistakes. I think the</p><p>text should be checked more thoroughly for mistakes.</p><p>1. Abstract line 17: What does "downstream" variants refer to?</p><p>2. On line 20 multi-sample variant calling formats are mentioned in</p><p>the abstract, but this is never mentioned further in the article. I</p><p>would either remove it from the abstract or add an explanation to</p><p>a later section.</p><p>3. Lines 25-26. The Authors mention that cohort samples can be analyzed</p><p>even without a control sample set. My question is whether it is</p><p>possible to make use of a control set or is it only possible to use</p><p>the standard option where the databases are checked?</p><p>4. Lines 26-27: "Finally, it can provide powerful filtering and</p><p>reporting options to help researchers make sense of cohort</p><p>studies." I would say "it provides powerful filtering and</p><p>reporting options". I find "make sense" to be too informal for a</p><p>scientific paper.</p><p>5. The Author summary contains several typos also some have</p><p>grammatical mistakes as well.</p><p>6. Lines 34-35: "but does not take into account the fact that the</p><p>variants belongs in a cohort." I don't know what this sentence</p><p>refers to exactly. Also, I have the same comment for line 52: "any</p><p>chort characteristic". I think there should be a clear discussion</p><p>on what these are and how they are used or not used by the</p><p>different software tools.</p><p>7. ANNOVAR interface and annotated variant file: lines 66-69. This</p><p>section contains grammatical mistakes and is not clearly</p><p>structured. I think it would be good to have workflow chart to make</p><p>clear how different inputs can be used. Starting from VCF either</p><p>VCF --(3rd party tools)--&#x0003e; annoteted VCF or</p><p>VCF --(TAPES as a wrapper for ANNOVAR)--&#x0003e; annoteted VCF. And how to proceed</p><p>with the annotated VCF. I could not use the sort function on a VCF,</p><p>only on CSV.</p><p>8. Line 69: "without having to specify the databases and annotations</p><p>to use." It is true that when running one does not have to specify them,</p><p>but at set up the user has to specify which databases are to be</p><p>used, according to my experience. Also this comment gives the</p><p>impression that the user has no control over which databases are</p><p>being used.</p><p>9. Lines 76-80. I think it would be nice to have a description on how</p><p>each criterion was implemented as supplementary at least. Then the</p><p>Authors could say that most criteria were straight forward to</p><p>implement (see suppl.), but the others we solved in the following</p><p>way, and then explain them.</p><p>10. Line 95. assumptions "are" made.</p><p>11. Line 125. I would not use "most confidence", but "highest level of</p><p>confidence".</p><p>12. Lines 128-129. I would suggest to reformulate the first sentence</p><p>to make it clearer.</p><p>13. Line 134. What does "in the class" mean?</p><p>14. Line 169. "sheer number of" I find this a bit too informal.</p><p>15. Figure 1. and surrounding text is not well formulated. It is</p><p>difficult to interpret the difference between "TAPES proba" and</p><p>"TAPES ACMG". I have only realized what the difference was once I</p><p>opened the supplementary table and saw the last two columns. I</p><p>think this could be improved.</p><p>16. Lines 166-167. How did the Authors arrive at the threshold values (0.35 and 0.8) for</p><p>probability scores? Was it to maximize the score on the</p><p>example/training dataset? I would suggest to use more than one dataset</p><p>for benchmarking and testing. It should be avoided to optimize a</p><p>method on the benchmarking set.</p><p>17. Figure 1. According to the benchmarks TAPES falls either between the two other</p><p>software or performs worse than the other two software if we use the</p><p>ACMG results according to the ROC and precision recall analysis. While</p><p>this is not discussed in the text. Also would the Authors suggest to</p><p>use the Probability instead of ACMG then?</p><p>18. Figure 3. I prefer graphs with two axes. Having two y-axes makes</p><p>it difficult to interpret. The two graphs could be shown below each</p><p>other (A and B) with the same x-axis, but separate y-axes for the two plots.</p><p>19. Lines 188-194. I think this section could be improved by adding</p><p>example output, adding context on how does it compare to a</p><p>workflow without TAPES to fully show the benefits of the method.</p><p>I suggest to separate real data and mock up (made up) data</p><p>examples.</p><p>20. TAPES is able to assign variants to ACMG categories and then can</p><p>do further sorting and reporting. Other software tools can also</p><p>use ACMG categories as mentioned in the introduction. Can TAPES</p><p>use the output of those software and then do sorting and reporting?</p><p>21. On which platforms was TAPES tested?</p><p>22. Please add a release for TAPES that is referred to in the article.</p><p>Also add version numbers for the software used (or commit tags from GitHub).</p><p>## Summary</p><p>Overall, I find the tool promising. However, I do think both the</p><p>software package and the article require significant revision.</p><p>I do believe that TAPES can become a valuable tool.&#x0003c;/module&#x0003e;</p><p>**********</p><p><bold>Have all data underlying the figures and results presented in the manuscript been provided?</bold></p><p>Large-scale datasets should be made available via a public repository as described in the <italic>PLOS Computational Biology</italic>

I still think that adding a flowchart on input, output and processes could be very helpful to easily understand the pipeline and the possibilities. Below I have included a suggested workflow chart.</p><p>Most importantly, please indicate clearly the input file and the reference set for the benchmark, and how the thresholds were calculated. Otherwise, readers cannot evaluate the validity, it would be only faith or distrust.</p><p>In addition, I recommend to further improve the git repo, because potential users will give up easily if it is not clear or there are two manny mistakes. Adding a tutotorial with example input (e.g. the benchmark would be an excelent example), commands to run and the interpretation would help users test that everything is installed correctly and help them understand how the program works and what the seteps are.</p><p>Example flowchart, based on the manual, in mermaid (it can be drawn using the online editor: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mermaidjs.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/">https://mermaidjs.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/</ext-link>):</p><p>```</p><p>graph TD</p><p>VCF --&#x0003e;an{annotate}</p><p>VCF --&#x0003e;an2</p><p>subgraph ANNOVAR</p><p>an2{annotate: table_annovar.pl}</p><p>end</p><p>an2 --&#x0003e;VCF2[VCF: annotated variants]</p><p>an2 --&#x0003e;TSV[TSV: annotated variants]</p><p>VCF2--&#x0003e;an</p><p>TSV --&#x0003e;|?|sort</p><p>subgraph TAPES</p><p>subgraph wrapped ANNOVAR</p><p>an</p><p>end</p><p>an --&#x0003e; Annot[CSV: annotated variants]</p><p>Annot --&#x0003e;sort{sort}</p><p>sort --&#x0003e;Sorted[CSV: sorted varainats]</p><p>Sorted --&#x0003e;X{analyse}</p><p>end</p><p>X --&#x0003e;|by_sample| S[By sample report]</p><p>X --&#x0003e;|by_gene| G[By gene reoprt]</p><p>X --&#x0003e;|enrich| E[EnrichR report]</p><p>X --&#x0003e;|list| L[Kegg, List and Disease reoprt]</p><p>```</p><p># Questions based on the response from the Authors</p><p>In one of the answers the Authors mention that for the benchmarking they used the dataset from the CharGer publication. Please include this also in the manuscript, and also add to the repository. The same answer ends with the comment that a sentence has been added to line 176. I think that line numbering has changed, so I could not find the referenced sentence.</p><p>The Authors claim that ANNOVAR wrapping is totally optional, although I could not run any of the commands without setting up the database by first installing ANNOVAR.</p><p>I still don't understand how the threshold values 0.35 and 0.8 were chosen for the probability method which is the recommended method. My assumption is that based on the benchmark set the Authors identified which cutoffs would yield the maximum number of correctly identified variants. If this is true then an independent data set is needed to test how valid the calls are, because the benchmark and training set should be independent from each other. If this assumption is false, please include the method used for deciding the threshold values.</p><p># Textual comments</p><p>Line 35: "does not take into account the abundance of a variants in a cohort" should be "do not take into account the abundance of variants in a cohort"</p><p>Line 66-70. I could not perform the described steps without installing ANNOVAR and the setting up the database. Either include clearly in the manual how this can be done or modify this paragraph.</p><p>Line 116 should read "TAPES provides an array of different useful reports."</p><p>Line 119. "on the command line" not "in"</p><p>Line 121. "a pathway" not plurar</p><p>Line 122. "users do research" could be "run searches"</p><p>Line 145. TAPES will or does?</p><p>Line 158. Is the table only used as reference or also as input for the analysis? Please add the input.</p><p>Line 167-168. How do the ROC curves suggest the threshold values?</p><p>Figure 3: Why is the old TAPES curve used instead of the new one that is already in the git repo?</p><p># Code review</p><p>The code still contains bugs that cause it to crash. Although the git repo suggests using `python tapes.py`, since tapes.py is written in python3 and the default python on many linux systems is python2 the program crashes.</p><p>Many of the example commands contains incorrect hyphen character that results in an error when copy pasting them to command line.</p><p>Attempting o run the "Quick Start" section</p><p>`python tapes.py db -s -A /path/to/annovar/` -&#x0003e; `python3 tapes.py db -s -A ~/temp/tapes/annovar/`</p><p>Worked fine with absolute path, but fails with relative path with a non informative error.</p><p>`python3 tapes.py db -s -A ../tapes/annovar/` Gives the following output:</p><p>```</p><p>No acmg_db path given and no db_config.json found</p><p>Default is: /home/user/temp/tapes-0.1/acmg_db</p><p>***TAPES: SEE DATABASE***</p><p>2019-09-04 13:45:59.....Fetching ANNOVAR Alldb file</p><p>NOTICE: Web-based checking to see whether ANNOVAR new version is available ...
