This is a rapid and efficient way to genetically manipulate early developing embryos, and to introduce microbes, chemical compounds, nanoparticles or tracers at larval stages. Here we demonstrate the development of a machine learning software that allows for microinjection at a trained target site in zebrafish eggs at unprecedented speed. The software is based on the open-source deep-learning library Inception v3. In a first step, the software distinguishes wells containing embryos at one-cell stage from wells to be skipped with an accuracy of 93%. A second step was developed to pinpoint the injection site. Deep learning allows to predict this location on average within 42 &#x003bc;m to manually annotated sites. Using a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), both steps together take less than 100 milliseconds. We first tested our system by injecting a morpholino into the middle of the yolk and found that the automated injection efficiency is as efficient as manual injection (~ 80%). Next, we tested both CRISPR/Cas9 and DNA construct injections into the zygote and obtained a comparable efficiency to that of an experienced experimentalist. Combined with a higher throughput, this results in a higher yield. Hence, the automated injection of CRISPR/Cas9 will allow high-throughput applications to knock out and knock in relevant genes to study their mechanisms or pathways of interest in diverse areas of biomedical research.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>RB, AHM and HPS were supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) Domain Applied and Engineering Sciences (TTW project 13259).

In addition, it is also a suitable technique to introduce chemical compounds that otherwise do not readily enter the embryo due to the compound lipophilicity properties and the protection function of the chorion [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. More recently, microinjections have been also used in the fields of toxicology and nanomedicine to evaluate nanoparticles toxicity at different functional levels and to inject nanoparticles encapsulating genetic material or therapeutic drugs to specific tissues in older embryos and/or larvae [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The intrinsic biological properties of zebrafish make it particularly amenable to this technique, since these cyprinids are highly fecund, a spawning pair typically producing more than 400 eggs at a time. Moreover, fertilization is external and spawning is confined to a brief period at dawn (natural or artificial), allowing for timing of the experiments. Furthermore, the chorion of zebrafish eggs is supple and easy to pierce.</p><p>Classically, injection of tracer dyes is used to identify single cell populations [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], to follow cell lineages and to build fate maps in zebrafish [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The development of molecular methods for the zebrafish model enabled functional studies by manipulating the expression of specific genes. Injection of messenger RNA (mRNA) can be used to overexpress and misexpress a specific protein [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], while morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (MOs) can be employed to knock down a given target gene [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In zebrafish mRNA and MO injections are simply performed by introducing a fine-tipped needle into the yolk of one-cell stage eggs and delivering nanoliter volumes of the injection material into it [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As cytoplasmic streaming will move the mRNA or MOs into the cytoplasm, it is not necessary that the injection targets the cell. While injection into the yolk requires some skill, it can usually be learned within a few weeks. Nevertheless, injections of mRNAs and MOs have their drawbacks. First of all, the effect is only transient, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. the injected molecules will be degraded and/or diluted with time. Moreover, in the case of mRNA injection, tissue-specific upregulation is not possible and a given mRNA will be expressed in all tissues indiscriminately. Also, the specificity of MO antisense technology has recently been questioned as MOs can sometimes lead to misleading results due to toxicity and off-target effects [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In a recent study [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], loss-of-function mutations for ten different genes previously thought to have an essential role in development failed to recapitulate the corresponding morpholino-induced phenotypes. In several cases, the discrepancy between mutant and morphant phenotypes, could be explained by genetic compensation mechanisms that occur in mutants [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], however, undoubtedly rigorous controls are required to ascertain the reliability of MO-induced phenotypes [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>In the last years, with the implementation of targeted nuclease techniques in the zebrafish, the demand for genetic evidence to define gene function has greatly increased. Fortunately, after a somewhat slow start using zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the adaptation of the prokaryotic CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR associated protein 9) defence system to engineer genomes [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] has revolutionized reverse genetics in zebrafish.</p><p>Recently the CRISPR/Cas9 system was adapted and optimised to engineer genomes. A single synthetic guide RNA (gRNA) directs Cas9-mediated cleavage of target DNA [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and the method was implemented in multiple systems including zebrafish [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], finally paving the road for knock-ins in this model [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Along with <italic>Tol2</italic> mediated transgenesis, a transposon system based on the <italic>Tol2</italic> element of medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>) widely used in zebrafish to create transgenic lines [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the CRISPR/Cas9 system has become an essential tool for genome editing in zebrafish. In this context microinjection is an essential technique. For the creation of genetically altered lines in zebrafish, be it through <italic>Tol2</italic> transgenesis or by means of zinc finger nucleases, TALEN or Cas9 nucleases, it is critical to inject the solution directly into the blastomere at the one-cell stage or at least at the interface between blastomere and yolk [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Contrary to RNA or MOs, DNA appears not to be transported into the blastomere via cytoplasmic streaming. Moreover, efficiency of all these genome editing techniques is much lower compared to mRNA or MOs injections. Therefore, in order to create genetically altered zebrafish lines it is essential to master microinjections into the cell. This can be challenging as this type of injection requires long training and excellent technical skills.</p><sec id="sec002"><title>Automated microinjection system</title><p>One of the first reports attempting to establish an automated microinjection system was published by Wang and colleagues in 2007 [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This microrobotic system based on computer vision and motion control was able to inject zebrafish embryos at an average speed of 25 seconds per embryo. Although quite innovative, this system is limited by the low batch size (only up to 24 embryos per plate) and low injection speed [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] compared to the first version of our microinjection system [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This automated microinjection system featured half-spherical wells, moulded in agarose gel, which allowed for high-throughput microinjection into the yolk of zebrafish eggs at fast speed (1 embryo in 1.8 seconds). This was used for microinjection of bacteria, morpholinos [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The great advantage over other systems was the higher batch size and speed of the injections allowing to inject up to 2000 embryos per hour and up to 2580 embryos per plate. As the initial cell division steps in zebrafish embryos occur in intervals of 20&#x02013;40 minutes, speed is crucial for the accuracy, reproducibility and number of experiments.</p><p>In our experience, it is apparent that injections into the middle of the yolk are less suitable for DNA injections. Therefore as a first step, the program &#x0201c;click-to-inject&#x0201d; was developed to test the efficiency of injections closer to the first cell [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. With this, we noticed that we could achieve a great increase in efficiency, similar to manual injections done into the first cell.

As the zebrafish egg is very transparent, epi illumination from below is not suitable; most contrast and edges are then lost. As the egg is spherical, a ring-light displays a very bright circle on top of the egg. Therefore, to obtain better and more reproducible imaging conditions in different locations, we placed a large (L x B = 60 x 80 cm<sup>2</sup>) diffuse light source above the robotic injector. Five different classes were used to annotate the images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202377.g002">Fig 2</xref>). In the &#x0201c;Inject&#x0201d; class the ideal injection position for automated microinjection is also annotated. Instead of injecting directly into the zygote, we have chosen to inject in the yolk, close to the visible zygote. The reason is that injections in a thin zygote (less ideal orientation, or very early stage) would often cause a rotation of the egg, and bounce the needle off. Injections into the yolk-blastomere boundary almost never show this problem, and thus gave a higher yield.</p><fig id="pone.0202377.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0202377.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Imaging classification for injection.</title><p>Representative digital images measured from below of an agarose grid (&#x0201c;Empty&#x0201d;) that supports zebrafish eggs with the first cell visible (&#x0201c;Inject&#x0201d;) or not visible (&#x0201c;No cell&#x0201d;), eggs in a two- or higher cell stage (&#x0201c;Two cell&#x0201d;) or non-viable eggs (&#x0201c;Sick&#x0201d;).

The Hough circle transform [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] allowed us to detect the yolk with an above 90% accuracy. However, the next step to find the first cell was problematic. In cases where the shadow of the micromanipulator overlapped with the first cell, the edge detection algorithm failed. As an alternative to edge detection, we annotated a database of images with injection positions. We used a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm to find a closest matching egg in this database and used that image to infer an injection position. This worked reasonably well with a peak error (distance between calculated position and annotated position) of 20 &#x003bc;m. However, when a good match could not be found, the error was quite high, and as a result the tail of the error was quite large. An explanation for the large variation in results is that there is also a large variation in first cell shapes, especially when looking from an arbitrary angle. It can be an early very thin line up to about a third of the yolk depending on the developmental stage and orientation of the egg. To overcome this variation, we could make the annotated database larger, to increase the chance of a close match. Nevertheless, the downside of this solution is that more images have to be compared, and this takes more processing time during injection. Thus, we sought to apply a better approach based on deep learning.</p><p>Using a database of annotated images as input, one can also train a deep learning network. Instead of comparing images during runtime, one trains an algorithm that is afterwards used to interpret new images. The execution time of this algorithm is independent of the size of the training image set. Thus, roughly speaking, the larger the number of annotated images, the higher the accuracy of the algorithm. We used the Inception v3 open source deep learning software [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This software has been built and tested to categorize images, based on a large training database of images, initially for the annual ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.image-net.org/">www.image-net.org</ext-link>). The Inception v3 architecture uses a neural network that takes the pixels of images as input and extracts features. Many features are subsequently built on top of features, in different layers of neurons, in higher and higher levels of abstraction, until the neurons reach an output of defined categories [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. One advantage of the Inception v3 software is that one can reuse the first layers of feature extraction for a different set of images. This is built on the idea that the basic features, <italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. lines and simple patterns, can be used in all higher-level features that are used to train new categories with new sets of images. Within eight hours of training time we reached a 93% accuracy, with an execution time in the order of tens of milliseconds.</p><p>After finding the images with a visible first cell, the next step was to determine the injection location. To enable the use of deep learning for this problem, we had to modify the output from categories into an ideal location. When just the pixel (x y) coordinate is used as output, only one pixel of the whole image is correct. With this output the neuronal network cannot easily distinguish between locations closer to the annotated location and further away, and this makes learning impossible. Therefore, we translated the (x y) coordinates to a barycentric coordinate system [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The Greek word &#x0201c;<italic>barys</italic>&#x0201d; means heavy and refers to the centre of gravity. In a barycentric coordinate system a grid of triangles is used, with a weight assigned to each vertex. This is used as follows. A chosen grid of triangles is placed on top of each image. The annotated injection position will fall within one triangle; then the weights of these triangle vertices are given a value according to the location within that triangle. These weights sum up to one, whereas the other vertices in the grid are all zero. This vertices output vector then represents the ideal outcome. The advantage is now that a small deviation from this ideal output vector can be scored gradually instead of binary. This then allows for efficient training. A more detailed explanation is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202377.s001">S1 Text</xref>. After eight hours of training we created a table of (x y) coordinates using validation images. We calculated the distance between the annotated injection position and the position as predicted by the deep learning network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202377.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The average distance is 42 &#x003bc;m, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202377.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, and for 83% of the images this distance is smaller than 60 &#x003bc;m.</p><fig id="pone.0202377.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0202377.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Distance between annotated and computed injection location.</title><p>(A) Bar graph depicting the frequency of the distance between annotated and computed injection position (prediction).

In our robotic microinjection system, injecting in the middle of the yolk gives the highest speed. Image recognition used to customise an injection location takes time but can increase the injection efficiency. To balance efficiency and speed, and to be able to monitor improvements of our image recognition model, we started by measuring efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 injections performed in the yolk. Both manual and automated yolk injections gave a very low efficiency of 12% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202377.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Then, with the &#x0201c;click-to-inject&#x0201d; program (semi-auto), resulting in injections closer to the first cell we could generate albino larvae at an almost three times higher efficiency than with the injections in the middle of the yolk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202377.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Next, using deep learning (auto), we could automate this procedure and with this we reached a slightly lower efficiency when comparing it the &#x0201c;click-to-inject&#x0201d; injections but a higher efficiency than the one obtained with automated and manual injections in the middle of the yolk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202377.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Still, manual injections into the first cell reached the highest efficiency of 43% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202377.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202377.g004">Fig 4B</xref> shows that both the efficiency and the variation between experiments differs considerably depending on the experimentalist (displayed as P1: experienced, P2: expert and P3: novice). In contrast, here, the automated injections show relatively little variation, also when compare them to the &#x0201c;click-to-inject&#x0201d; (semi-auto) injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202377.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Also, it can be seen that the efficiency is quickly surpassed by humans given enough experience (P1 and P2). This lower efficiency achieved with the robot can be explained by the injection location&#x02013;close-to-cell instead of into the zygote&#x02013;and by the fact that not all the eggs are oriented with a cell visible on the side, despite the fact that they are oriented in the agar grid. Hence, the automated injections tend to be a mixture of injections into the middle of the yolk, and close to the first cell, when the first cell was detected.

With CRISPR/Cas9 samples the robot needs 6 seconds of injection time to obtain a positive larva, and humans need 8 up to 43 seconds. On average, the robot is more than three times (3.6x) faster.

Using the measured efficiencies and statistics of image classification we can calculate the efficiencies of injections close to the first cell. During the injections of CRISPR/Cas9, on average 65% of the eggs were oriented with a first cell visible, and 35% were injected into the middle of the yolk. The increase in efficiency, 24%, was caused by 65% of the eggs being injected with efficiency much higher than 12%. Using the efficiency of the yolk injections we can predict the efficiency of injections close to the first cell. Solving the equation 0.65*X+0.35*0.12 = 0.24 for X results in an efficiency of around 30% for injections close to the first cell. For DNA injections we have chosen to not orient the eggs after placing them in a grid, and therefore less eggs, 46%, were injected close to the first cell. Solving the equation 0.46*X + 0.54*0.32 = 0.39 for X results in a predicted efficiency of 47% for injections close to the first cell. Surprisingly, this is much higher than what was obtained by manual injections close to the first cell. The higher efficiency of DNA injections (47%) versus CRISPR/Cas9 injections (24%) can be partially explained by the fact that the integration of a single copy of DNA construct can still be detected, while the readout of the CRISPR/Cas9 injection requires a non-synonymous mutation to occur on both alleles in order to have a visible phenotype, the albino phenotype being recessive. A non-synonymous mutation in one copy of <italic>slc45a2</italic> would not be detected in our assay. Hence, we expect that the actual number of induced CRISPR/Cas9 mutations is underestimated.</p><p>These measured and calculated efficiencies can also be used to make a prediction of the positive embryos, directly after the injection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Conclusion and perspectives</title><p>In this study we have demonstrated how we improved an automated injection robot to inject close to the first cell using image recognition in order to enable efficient genome editing in zebrafish embryos. This was accomplished using a modified open-source deep-learning software and annotation of thousands of images. A step-by-step approach of first testing an annotation strategy and efficiency helped to predict the increase in efficiency that can be obtained. Initially we tested the efficiency with a semi-automated click-to-inject program. This click-to-inject approach is also suitable as a first step for other microinjection applications, such as injections into older zebrafish larvae or different organisms.</p><p>Because of its transparency, rapid development and easy genetic manipulation, zebrafish have become a key vertebrate model organism for the elucidation of developmental processes. With the advent of CRISPR/Cas9 technology, zebrafish are becoming an even more powerful tool for the study of diverse human disorders. The CRISPR/Cas9 system achieves mutagenesis rate of around 80% for generation of knockout lines [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and has proven to have fewer side effects than other genome editing technologies. However, generation of specific hereditable mutations or epitope tagging of chromosomal genes in zebrafish is still challenging. Unfortunately, genome editing in zebrafish is unpredictable and efficiency sometimes drops to 3.5% [<xref rid="pone.0202377.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Therefore, higher number of eggs should be injected for the generation of the expected mutation. Creation of zebrafish mutant lines using CRISPR/Cas9 requires precise injections into or close to the zygote. These types of injections take time to master and are tedious if many batches of hundreds of eggs have to be injected, particularly for the generation of knock-in lines. Our results have shown that efficiency and reproducibility of manual cell injections highly depend on the training stage of the person performing the experiment, making it more difficult to have this technique as a routine procedure in the laboratory. Here, we show the establishment of automated injections as a reliable tool for the generation of CRISPR/Cas9 mutants. Automated microinjections are simple to learn and allow the cell injection of 100 embryos in 2.5 minutes with comparable efficiency to manual cell injections. This method could also be used for high-throughput gene overexpression studies by microinjection of mRNA.</p><sec id="sec024"><title>The need for high-throughput genome manipulation</title><p>To date there have been almost 9,000 morpholinos used in zebrafish research. In addition, the adaption of CRISPR/Cas9 editing technology is progressing faster than any other gene silencing method, and even faster than the adoption of morpholino knockdown technology (statistics on zfin.org). However, injections of mRNAs or DNA must be more precise and are more time consuming. Therefore injection can be a limiting step for high-throughput genetic studies. For the moment, there are about 30,000 known gene loci that could be interesting to manipulate in order to investigate their function in development, disease or expressed phenotype (zfin.org). Multiplied with 300 injections that are typically used to obtain a mutant, and multiple mutants per gene, this brings us to tens of millions of injections. Much time and efforts would be saved if this tedious but needed task can be performed mostly by robotic systems.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0202377.s001"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Deep learning supplement.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0202377.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0202377.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Movie demonstrating robotic injections with deep learning.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0202377.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0202377.s003"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Demo source code and demo images.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0202377.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0202377.s004"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Data set used for plotting the graphs.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0202377.s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0202377.s005"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Representative images of manual and automated yolk injections with <italic>slc45a2</italic> morpholino.</title><p>The images show four days post-fertilization (dpf) larvae that were injected manually (A) or injected by the automated robot (B) with control morpholino (top) and <italic>slc45a2</italic> morpholino (bottom).
