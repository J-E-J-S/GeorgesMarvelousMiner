MM is essentially incurable without a means of early diagnosis and no successful standard of care. These facts indicate a deep chasm of knowledge that needs to be filled. Our group recently delved into MM tumor biology from the perspective of exosome-contained microRNAs (miRNAs). We discovered that the most abundant miRNAs in MM cancer exosomes were tumor suppressors, particularly miR-16-5p. This observation lead us to hypothesize that MM cells preferentially secreted tumor-suppressor miRNAs via exosomes. Through separate avenues of potential therapeutic advance, we embarked on an innovative strategy to kill MM tumor cells. We employed small molecule inhibitors to block exosome secretion, thereby reducing miR-16-5p exosome loss and replenishing cellular miR-16-5p leading to reduced tumorigenic capacity and miR-16-5p target oncoproteins CCND1 and BCL2. Additionally, we force-fed MM tumor exosomes back to MM tumor cells, which led to cell death, and a reduction in the same oncoproteins. We recapitulated these results with direct transfection of miR-16-5p, confirmed that this is a cancer-cell specific effect, and elucidated a part of the miR-16-5p mechanism of exosome loading.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>miRNAs</kwd><kwd>Mesothelioma</kwd><kwd>Mechanisms of disease</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense (United States Department of Defense)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-13-PRCRP-IA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shukla</surname><given-names>Arti</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a remarkably deadly cancer arising after exposure to asbestos fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Median life-span after diagnosis is 6-12 months, there is a latency period of 20-50 years after initial asbestos exposure, and MM is relatively un-diagnosable until the disease is in advanced stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Due to limited knowledge of biomarkers for asbestos exposure and early detection of this cancer, coupled with no successful therapeutic regimens other than chemotherapeutic intervention with cisplatin and pemetrexed, this disease signifies large gaps in scientific knowledge that, when filled, would greatly benefit human health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">An exciting realm of cancer research has developed over the past decade by focusing on nano-sized extracellular vesicles, known as exosomes, to answer pivotal problems such as those mentioned above. Exosomes refer to a class of vesicles produced via the endocytic pathway and ranging in size from 30-140&#x02009;nm in diameter. As a new piece to the puzzle of cancer, exosomes represent an important aspect of biological signaling between cells and as a means of novel biomarker identification strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. This is directly linked to the biofunctional cargo enriched in exosomes such as proteins, miRNAs, and lipids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">To date there are only a handful of publications focusing on exosomes in the disease setting of mesothelioma. The initial steps towards this area were to analyze the proteomic make up of exosomes isolated from pleural effusions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and separately by mesothelioma tumor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. A decade after these reports, it was shown that tumor-derived exosomes could be used in dendritic-cell (DC) based immunotherapeutic strategies against mesothelioma by treating tumor-bearing mice with DCs loaded with MM exosomes, showing that the exosomes imparted the mice with an immunological response against the MM thereby increasing survival rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Recently, Greening <italic>et al</italic>. added to the field that MM exosome signature reflects oncogenic cargo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in oncogenesis and could be exploited as potential therapeutic targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.There have been multiple of investigations into the miRNAs involved in mesothelioma, particularly by Glen Reid&#x02019;s group who has summarized a large swath of such knowledge and reported miRNA levels in MM tumor cells and tissues. Of note, the study indicated very low expression levels of tumor suppressor miRNAs in MM such as miR-16-5p, miR-15, miR-31, and let-7a, to name a few<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In another study by Oliveto <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> miR-24-3p has been identified as an oncomir that is pro-migratory in MM. Furthermore, diagnostic value of miRNAs in asbestos exposure and MM has also been proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> Notably, as per our knowledge only one current research article looks at the miRNA signature associated with circulating extracellular vesicle (EV) miRNAs in MM patients, and found that miR-103a-3p and miR-30e-3p were discriminatory for MM from asbestos-exposed patients with no cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Recently, our group has shown differential abundance of exosome proteomic signatures in mouse-serum after asbestos exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and suggested a novel mechanism by which MM may develop by exosomes traveling from asbestos exposed cells to mesothelial cells thereby modifying the mesothelial cells&#x02019; gene expression patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Our present study is the first to present a quarry into the exosomal miRNAs of MM along with findings implicating new avenues of potential biomarkers and therapeutic options. Here, we investigate the signature miRNAs in MM tumor cell exosomes, and formulated a hypothesis that MM tumor cells preferentially secrete the tumor suppressor miR-16-5p via exosomes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that by inhibiting exosome secretion or force-feeding cancer exosomes back to MM cells can rebuild miR-16-5p levels in the cancer cells resulting in significant killing of cancer cells. Our findings may lead to potential therapeutic strategies for MM in future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Exosome isolation and characterization from MM cells</title><p id="Par7">The isolation of exosome samples was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Western blot analysis for exosomal marker CD81, and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

Subsequent analysis of miR-16-5p provided with confirmation that inhibition of exosome secretion leads to concomitant reduction in secreted miR-16-5p in addition to increased levels of intracellular miR-16-5p within MM cancer cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). This result suggests that both inhibitors function differently in their capacity to effect exosome secretion and miR-16 secretion, and that neither inhibitor regulates levels of miR-16. If the inhibitors regulated miR-16 levels directly, we would expect to have seen intracellular levels of the miRNA altering in the same direction as observed in the exosomes; instead, they are increased in the cell and decreased in the exosomes. For further validation, we measured 4 other exosomally secreted miRNAs that were initially identified by microarray, and found that exosome inhibition also leads to reduced levels of exosomal miR-222-3p, miR-30a-5p, miR31-5p, and let-7e-5p (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>), when measured from direct exosome preparations.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Inhibition of exosome secretion from Hmeso MM cancer cells attenuates exosomal miRNA secretion.

Our hypothesis was to attack these knowledge gaps by embarking to uncover potential miRNA biomarkers and therapeutic targets with the focus on MM tumor exosomes. To date, exosomes have been a trending theme in cancer research and there have been wonderful advancements in understanding cancer through the lens of tumor exosomal miRNAs as possible biomarkers and therapies in many cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, however, not much is known about their role(s) in MM.</p><p id="Par23">Our initial findings were surprising in that we observed MM tumor cells secreting significantly higher levels of tumor suppressor miRNAs, particularly miR-16-5p, compared to non-cancer mesothelial cells in exosomes. Previous studies of MM have well-characterized miR-16-5p as both a tumor suppressor by targeting oncogenes BCL2 and CCND1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and as a remarkably under-expressed miRNA in MM tumor cells and tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Moreover, miR-16-5p has been reported as a potential therapeutic molecule by restoring its expression in MM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Based on these previously reported pieces of evidence on the role of miR-16-5p in MM, and our new findings of presence of miR-16-5p in exosomes led us to the innovative hypothesis that MM tumor cells preferentially secrete miR-16-5p, among other tumor suppressors, via exosomes to rid their cancer-killing effects. Similar results have been stated previously in ovarian cancer that may behave similarly in secreting high levels of tumor suppressor miRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par24">The other over-expressed tumor associated exosomal miRNAs also have interesting biological relevance in MM: miR-222-3p is downregulated in MM and is a negative regulator of CDK1 (p27) and is a PTEN suppressor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>; miR-30a-5p (along with miR-222-3p and miR-31-5p), in the same family as miR-30e, is associated with good prognosis when in higher abundance in MM tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>; and miR-320 family members are suggested as potential biomarkers for malignant pleural mesothelioma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par25">This set of miRNAs along with miR-16-5p were under-expressed in the MM cells from which they were being secreted. Our findings are supported by literature that MM cells and tumors have low levels of tumor suppressor miRNAs including miR-16-5p<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> as compared to mesothelial cells. This leads us to the possibility that miR-16-5p is not simply randomly packaged into cancer exosomes due to inherently high abundance in the exosome producer cells, but that it must be systematically sequestered into exosomes by a biologically preferential loading process. The low miR-16-5p in MM tumor cells observed by us and others could be attributed to its increased secretion via exosomes, as opposed to common loss of tumor suppressors via mutation and deletion.</p><p id="Par26">Because of miR-16-5p&#x02019;s tumor suppressive effect and our hypothesis of its preferential secretion from MM tumor cells by exosomes, we aimed to inhibit MM cell tumorigenesis by inhibiting exosome secretion. The idea being that if exosome secretion were significantly down-regulated, that miR-16-5p stores would rebuild in the tumor cells and lead to oncogenic targeting and subsequent cell death.</p><p id="Par27">Based on successful outcomes in the literature we chose to use two separate exosome secretion inhibitory approaches. The neutral sphingolmyelinase-2 inhibitor GW4869, which blocks ceramide production that is needed to bud exosomes inward at the endosomal surface, has been indicated as a useful avenue for blocking exosome secretion as well as increasing the efficacy/reducing chemotherapeutic drug resistance to cisplatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Further, a combination of two small molecules bisindolylmaleimide-I and chloramidine have also been shown to reduce exosome secretion from cells and increase chemotherapeutic retention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par28">Using GW or B&#x00026;C treatment of Hmeso cells, led directly to significant reductions in exosomal miR-16-5p along with other miRNA secretions and significantly increased stores of cell cytoplasmic miR-16-5p. The inhibition of exosome release coupled with miR-16-5p retention in cells provided direct evidence that the miRNAs we were investigating were indeed being released in exosomes, and that we could prevent their preferential release and achieve the goal of miR-16-5p tumor suppressor retention. Also, we see that both inhibitors used, did not appear to negatively regulate the expression of miR-16-5p in the cells, as seen by the increased cellular miR-16-5p, so we can conclude that the drugs work by inhibiting exosomal miR-16-5p secretion and not the levels within the cell. Further confirmation of miR-16-5p retention was assessed by significantly reduced protein abundance of the miR-16-5p targets CCND1 and BCL2 and substantial inhibition in tumorigenesis as measured by loss of cell number, 3D tumor spheroid growth, transformation/colony growth, migratory and invasive capacity of MM tumor cells.</p><p id="Par29">Additionally, we indicate that exosome secretion may play an important role in chemotherapeutic resistance of MM to cisplatin, given that exosome inhibition leads to increased cisplatin-induced cell death in our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies.

All studies to date on the effect of tumor exosomes has indicated that they are pro-tumorigenic by multiple means (immunosuppression, drug resistance, enhanced tumor growth/proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, mesenchymal/fibroblastic transitions etc.)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. However, our hypothesis was different because of our intriguing findings that MM tumor exosomes have high volumes of tumor suppressor miRNAs, especially miR-16-5p, and may have a tumor killing effect.</p><p id="Par31">Remarkably, addition of MM exosomes back to the producer MM cells, led to incredible levels of cell death in a dose dependent manner as compared to controls. Further, upon force-feeding of MM cancer exosomes to cancer cells, we see significant decreases in miR-16-5p target oncogenic protein CCND1. This is a vital result in that it shows that we can demonstrate the same result as exosome inhibition but in a separate route. Importantly, MM cancer exosome force-feeding, even more notably, was only seen to kill MM cancer cells and had no effect on normal mesothelial cells. Also, normal mesothelial cell exosomes had no effect on cancer cells or on themselves when force-fed back.</p><p id="Par32">These findings are the first of their kind, to show that not only can a certain cancer&#x02019;s exosomes lead to the death of their producer cells, but they do so in a specific manner that does not affect non-cancer cells. The implications of this are exciting in that they may suggest a very new therapeutic option in MM by targeting tumor cells with their own exosomes. This is especially noteworthy given that the effect of MM exosomes on the cancer cells is implicated in the effect of the tumor suppressor miR-16-5p that is functioning in the exosome inhibition experiments.</p><p id="Par33">We do understand that we are drawing our discussion of force-feeding exosomes based only on one component of what is being redelivered to the tumor cells. In reality, the exosomes will be delivering back a vast array of molecules in combination to the miR-16-5p and other tumor suppressors, and those effects should be considered. Essentially, we know that miR-16-5p plays a role in this complicated biology, but there is likely a lot of interplay with everything else within the MM tumor exosomes that needs to be studied.</p><p id="Par34">Moreover, we recapitulated the same findings from exosome inhibition and force-feeding via direct transfection of miR-16-5p, providing firm evidence that not only is exosome secretion a pro-tumorigenic mechanism of MM by preferential secretion of miR-16-5p but that exosomal miR-16-5p is of potential therapeutic importance as reported before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. As a counterintuitive piece of evidence, we did see that although miR-16-5p levels increased intracellularly in MM cancer cells after transfection of miR-16-5p mimic, the levels in their exosomes significantly plummeted. This may suggest that miR-16-5p levels may also play a role in the loading or secretion of exosomes with miR-16-5p within. As NTA analysis showed no significant differences in the number of particles in response to miR-16-5p transfection, there is a further possibility of miR-16-5p exhibiting an effect on packaging/loading system of exosomes.</p><p id="Par35">Here we also intended to unlock the potential mechanism for miR-16 loading into exosomes within MM cancer cells. Based on previous reports of RNA binding protein HuR interaction with miR-16-5p<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and evident role in exosome secretion of other miRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, we explored its role in our experimental settings. Significant reduction in HuR expression via siRNA lead to increased amount of miR-16-5p in cells, and significantly reduced the amount secreted in exosomes. This result is evidence that HuR is at least partly involved in the packaging of miR-16-5p into MM cancer exosomes.</p><p id="Par36">Furthermore, previous research has also shown that miR-16 targets the expression of HuR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, we also provide this same evidence as measured by Western blot analysis, telling us something very interesting about the mechanistics of miR-16-5p exosomal loading and the interplay of HuR. Based on our results thus far, we have drawn together a proposed mechanism that may be involved where HuR promotes miR-16-5p loading into exosomes, meaning that siHuR knockdown of HuR protein levels leads to reduced exosomal miR-16-5p, and hence increased miR-16-5p in the cell. It is then implicated that miR-16-5p targets HuR expression at the protein level, meaning that high miR-16-5p levels lead to low HuR and therefore, reduced exosomal miR-16-5p, which is exactly what our data represents. Because miR-16-5p upregulation by transfection does not affect exosome secretion by particle number, we know that this effect is limited to the packaging process of exosome cargo. Along this logic, we theorize that MM cancer cells not only have the evolutionary advantage for uncontrolled cell growth because of low intracellular stores of miR-16-5p based on high exosomal removal, but that miR-16-5p itself negatively regulates its own packaging into exosomes by targeting HuR (Supplemental Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>).</p><p id="Par37">Taken together, our findings strongly indicate that miR-16-5p is preferentially secreted by MM tumor cells via exosomes <italic>in vitro</italic>, and by inhibiting exosome secretion, miR-16-5p levels increase thereby reducing oncogenic protein levels and lead to significant loss of tumorigenic capacity of the MM cancer cells. We also indicate that the mechanism of exosomal miR-16-5p secretion is at least somewhat regulated by HuR, and that there is a negative feedback loop involved in this packaging when miR-16-5p levels are increased within the cell.</p><p id="Par38">Altogether, this novel research study provided unprecedented indications that MM tumor exosomes can be used to inhibit tumorigenesis, and this is related to the fact that the MM tumor cells preferentially secrete miR-16-5p through their exosomes to rid themselves of its tumor suppressor function.
