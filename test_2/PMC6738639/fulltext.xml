However, quantifying the fitness impact of translocations independently from the confounding effect of base substitutions has so far remained challenging. We report a novel application of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology allowing to generate with high efficiency both uniquely targeted and multiple concomitant reciprocal translocations in the yeast genome. Targeted translocations are constructed by inducing two double-strand breaks on different chromosomes and forcing the trans-chromosomal repair through homologous recombination by chimerical donor DNAs. Multiple translocations are generated from the induction of several DSBs in LTR repeated sequences and promoting repair using endogenous uncut LTR copies as template. All engineered translocations are markerless and scarless. Targeted translocations are produced at base pair resolution and can be sequentially generated one after the other. Multiple translocations result in a large diversity of karyotypes and are associated in many instances with the formation of unanticipated segmental duplications. To test the phenotypic impact of translocations, we first recapitulated in a lab strain the <italic>SSU1/ECM34</italic> translocation providing increased sulphite resistance to wine isolates. Surprisingly, the same translocation in a laboratory strain resulted in decreased sulphite resistance. However, adding the repeated sequences that are present in the <italic>SSU1</italic> promoter of the resistant wine strain induced sulphite resistance in the lab strain, yet to a lower level than that of the wine isolate, implying that additional polymorphisms also contribute to the phenotype. These findings illustrate the advantage brought by our technique to untangle the phenotypic impacts of structural variations from confounding effects of base substitutions. Secondly, we showed that strains with multiple translocations, even those devoid of unanticipated segmental duplications, display large phenotypic diversity in a wide range of environmental conditions, showing that simply reconfiguring chromosome architecture is sufficient to provide fitness advantages in stressful growth conditions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Chromosomes are highly dynamic objects that often undergo large structural variations such as reciprocal translocations. Such rearrangements can have dramatic functional consequences, as they can disrupt genes, change their regulation or create novel fusion genes at their breakpoints. For instance, 90&#x02013;95% of patients diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia carry the Philadelphia chromosome characterized by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. In addition, translocations reorganize the genetic information along chromosomes, which in turn can modify the 3D architecture of the genome and potentially affect its functioning. Quantifying the fitness impact of translocations independently from the confounding effect of base substitutions has so far remained challenging. Here, we report a novel CRISPR/Cas9-based technology allowing to generate with high efficiency and at a base-pair precision either uniquely targeted or multiple reciprocal translocations in yeast, without leaving any marker or scar in the genome. Engineering targeted reciprocal translocations allowed us for the first time to untangle the phenotypic impacts of large chromosomal rearrangements from that of point mutations. In addition, the generation of multiple translocations led to a large reorganization of the genetic information along the chromosomes, often including unanticipated large segmental duplications. We showed that reshuffling the genome resulted in the emergence of fitness advantage in stressful environmental conditions, even in strains where no gene was disrupted or amplified by the translocations.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></funding-source><award-id>ANR-16-CE12-0019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5732-2682</contrib-id><name><surname>Fischer</surname><given-names>Gilles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche M&#x000e9;dicale</institution></funding-source><award-id>fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4860-6728</contrib-id><name><surname>Fournier</surname><given-names>T&#x000e9;o</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Institut universitaire de France (IUF)</institution></funding-source><award-id>member</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schacherer</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-16-CE12-0019].

SVs comprise both unbalanced events, often designated as copy number variations (CNVs) including deletions and duplications, and balanced events that are copy number neutral and include inversions and translocations. Both have a phenotypic impact; however, the prevalence and the fitness effect of balanced SVs has been less documented than CNVs, partly because they are much more challenging to map than CNVs and also because quantifying their fitness contribution independently from the confounding effect of base substitutions remains challenging. Natural balanced chromosomal rearrangements result from the exchange of DNA ends during the repair of Double Strand Breaks (DSBs) either through Homologous Directed Repair (HDR) between dispersed repeats or intact chromosomes carrying internal repeat sequences homologous to the DNA ends [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] or through Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Artificial balanced rearrangements are classically engineered by inducing targeted DSBs and promoting repair through both HDR and NHEJ. However, inducing targeted DSBs and engineering scar-less chromosomal rearrangements has remained difficult. In early studies structural variants were obtained through recombination between heteroalleles or I-SceI-induced DSB repair between split alleles of a selection marker [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In later developments, the use of the I-SceI endonuclease was combined to a &#x0201c;COunter-selectable REporter&#x0201d; or CORE cassette in the frame of the <italic>delitto-perfetto</italic> technique, allowing the generation of a reciprocal translocation in a scar-less fashion [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Other techniques based on Cre/Lox recombination were used to make the genomes of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces mikatae</italic> colinear and generated interspecific hybrids that produced a large proportion of viable but extensively aneuploid spores [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Cre/Lox recombination was also used to assess the impact of balanced rearrangements in vegetative growth and meiotic viability [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A novel approach using yeast strains with synthetic chromosomes allowed extensive genome reorganization through Cre/Lox-mediated chromosome scrambling [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This approach proved to be efficient to generate strains with a wide variety of improved metabolic capacities [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Muramoto and collaborators recently developed a genome restructuring technology relying on a temperature-dependent endonuclease to conditionally introduce multiple rearrangements in the genome of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, thus generating strains with marked phenotypes such as increased plant biomass or ethanol production from xylose [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Methods using Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs) and Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs) were also developed to generate targeted rearrangement in yeast, mammalian and zebrafish cells [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Although these technologies provide very useful insights, they are often difficult to implement and/or rely on the use of genetic markers. For this reason, the development of the CRISPR/Cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR associated) system has boosted the field of genome engineering [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This system, initially derived from immune systems of bacteria, consists of an endonuclease encoded by the Cas9 gene of <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> and a short RNA that guides the endonuclease at the targeted genomic locus. The gRNA can be easily designed to target any genomic locus proximal to a &#x0201c;NGG&#x0201d; Promoter Adjacent Motif (PAM). This technology is now routinely used to introduce targeted DSBs in genomes from a wide variety of species [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In yeast, CRISPR/Cas9 induced DSBs can be repaired with high efficiency by providing homologous repair DNA cassettes, allowing a variety of genome editions. Previous studies achieved the introduction of point mutations, single and multiple gene deletions and multiplexed genome modifications at different loci by transforming cells with plasmids bearing single or multiple gRNAs and linear DNA repair templates [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. CRISPR-based approaches have also been developed to add centromeres and telomeres to chromosome fragments [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] concatenating chromosomes [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and for massively parallel genome editing to generate large libraries of genetic variants [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Interestingly, it has been noticed that multiplex genome editing can often result in undesirable chromosomal translocation suggesting that such rearrangements are likely programmable [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The ability to generate genome rearrangements with CRISPR/Cas9 has been known for some time [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and more recently used to engineer translocations in mammalian cells with high efficiency. The principle was to introduce two DSB in two distinct chromosome with CRISPR, then repair the DNA ends in <italic>trans</italic> by HDR with donor DNA carrying a selection marker, lost in a second step by Cre/Lox recombination leaving a single <italic>loxP</italic> element at the chromosomal junction [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, unequivocally determining the contribution of SVs to phenotype variations in a large variety of environmental conditions and independently from the contribution of single nucleotide variants cannot be envisioned in mammals because of overwhelming technical and ethical difficulties.</p><p>In this study, we developed two CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing strategies in yeast to generate markerless and scarless SVs with high efficiency in a control and unique genetic background, thus providing a mean to quantify their fitness impacts by high-throughput phenotyping independently from marker or background specific effects. The first strategy allowed generating on-demand any translocation at a base-pair resolution and we recapitulated the phenotypic consequences associated with known rearrangements. The second approach allows generating multiple SVs simultaneously leading to an important diversity of karyotypes. We showed that reshuffling the chromosome architecture between dispersed repeated sequences often results in the formation of large segmental duplications at translocation breakpoints. Strains with reshuffled genomes show large fitness diversity in various stress conditions, even in the absence of duplication when no gene or promoter sequence was directly disrupted by the translocations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Rationale for chromosome reshuffling</title><p>We used a single-vector which encodes both the Cas9 nuclease gene and a gRNA expression cassette. This cassette allows cloning either a DNA fragment of 430 base-pairs reconstituting two different gRNAs in tandem or a unique 20 bp fragment corresponding to the target sequence of a single gRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). This system is versatile as it allows generating either a single targeted or multiple translocations at once. Targeted translocations can be induced by a pair of gRNAs generating two concomitant DSBs in two different chromosomes. Any pair of gRNAs can be cloned in the vector in a single ligation step using as insert either a synthetic DNA fragment or a PCR product (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Methods</xref>). The two DSBs are repaired in <italic>trans</italic> upon homologous recombination with chimerical donor DNA resulting in targeted reciprocal translocations with a single-nucleotide precision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Multiple translocations are induced by generating several DSBs using a single gRNA that targets repeated sequences such as the Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs) scattered on different chromosomes. The multiple DSBs are repaired by recombination using the uncut copies of the LTRs as homologous templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).

To generate two concomitant DSBs on chromosomes V and XV carrying <italic>CAN1</italic> and <italic>ADE2</italic>, respectively, we cloned two previously described gRNA target sequences, namely CAN1.Y and ADE2.Y [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. To repair the DSBs, we used donor DNA fragments of 90 base-pairs each composed of two homology regions of 45 bp identical to the sequences flanking CRISPR cutting sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s008">S1 Table</xref>). Two combinations of DNA repair donor fragments were used. As a control, we used donors called Point Mutation-donors (PM-donors), promoting the intra-chromosomal repair of DSBs in <italic>cis</italic> and mutating PAM sequences into stop codons, thus preventing further Cas9 activity. The donors promoting inter-chromosomal repair in <italic>trans</italic>, thus leading to a Reciprocal Translocation were called RT-donors. No point mutation needed to be introduced into the PAM sequence in this case because the translocation generates chimerical target sequences not complementary to the original gRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Transformation with the plasmid bearing two gRNAs and either RT or PM-donors resulted in 95% and 76% of the colonies showing both the pink and resistance to canavanine phenotypes [ade2, CAN<sup>R</sup>], respectively (Material and Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In the RT-donor experiment the other 5% of colonies were all white and sensitive to canavanine, probably resulting from the transformation of the <italic>LEU2</italic> marker without induction of any DSB. In the PM experiment, we recovered 21% of white colonies, 83% of which being resistant to canavanine, likely resulting from a single DSB/repair in the <italic>CAN1</italic> gene.

We then confirmed by PCR the presence of the chimerical chromosomal junctions of 16 [ade2, CAN<sup>R</sup>] strains recovered from the RT experiment.

We took advantage of the high instability of the Cas9 plasmid that can be easily cured from the strains (Material and Methods). We first cured the plasmid from the two translocated strains. Then, we cloned a pair of gRNAs that target the chimerical junctions formed by the <italic>ADE2</italic>-<italic>CAN1</italic> translocation in the Cas9 plasmid and designed repair donors to restore <italic>ADE2</italic> and <italic>CAN1</italic> to their original configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s008">S1 Table</xref>). Co-transformation with the gRNAs plasmid and donor fragments resulted in 94.2% of colonies which restored the white and canavanine sensitive phenotypes [ADE2, Can<sup>S</sup>]. We performed pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) karyotyping of two [ADE2, Can<sup>S</sup>] strains. No difference could be observed between the karyotype of these two strains and that of the original BY4741 strain (YAF194 and YAF199 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The chromosomal junctions of the two de-translocated strains were Sanger-sequenced and were found identical to BY4741 natural junctions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). These results demonstrate that sequential chromosomal translocations can be engineered at base-pair resolution with high efficiency.</p><p>Finally, we also showed that our system can be used to simultaneously generate a deletion of a few nucleotides and a reciprocal translocation. We used the same CAN1.Y and ADE2.Y gRNA target sequences as above and designed new donor fragments inducing deletions of 27 and 23 bp, including the PAM sequences, on chromosome V and XV, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s002">S2A Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s008">S1 Table</xref>). As above, we obtained a high proportion of [ade2, CAN<sup>R</sup>] transformants (96%). PCR of the junctions and karyotyping of 4 strains showed that chromosome V and XV underwent the expected reciprocal translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The genome of one translocated strain was Nanopore sequenced and <italic>de-novo</italic> assembled (Material and Methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s009">S2 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s010">S3 Table</xref>) to check whether off-target activity of the Cas9 nuclease could result in unexpected additional rearrangements. The translocated and reference genomes were entirely collinear except for the expected translocation and associated deletions on chromosomes V and XV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).

This translocation resulted from a recombination event between 4 base-pair micro-homology regions on chromosomes VIII and XVI. We therefore engineered the same translocation into the BY4741 background. We designed two gRNA target sequences as close as possible to the micro-homology regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s003">S3A Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s008">S1 Table</xref>). The first gRNA targeted the <italic>SSU1</italic> promoter region, 115 base-pairs upstream of the start codon. The second gRNA targeted the promoter region of <italic>ECM34</italic>, 24 base-pairs upstream of the start codon. To mimic the translocated junctions, present in the wine strains, we designed 2 double stranded synthetic DNA donors of 90 base-pairs centered on the micro-homology regions but not on the cutting sites. In addition, each donor also contained a point mutation in the PAM sequences to prevent subsequent CRISPR recognition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s003">S3A Fig</xref>).</p><p>The transformations with the Cas9 plasmid containing the two gRNAs and the donor DNA yielded on average 202 transformants. We tested natural and chimerical junction by colony PCR for 16 transformants and found the expected chimerical junctions in 15 of them. This translocation was not visible by PFGE karyotyping because the size of the translocated chromosomes were too close to the size of the original chromosomes (XVI 948 kb, VIII 563 kb, VIIItXVI 921 kb and XVItVIII 599 kb). To further validate the rearrangement, we checked the junctions by Southern blot for one translocated strain with probes flanking the two cutting sites on chromosome VIII and XVI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). This experiment validates the presence of the chimerical junction fragments in the rearranged strain YAF082 as compared to the WT. Finally, we sequenced the junctions of the translocated strain and found that the rearrangement occurred within the expected micro-homology regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). In addition, the system was designed such that both mutated PAMs ended up into the promoter of <italic>ECM34</italic> after the translocation, therefore unlikely to have any impact on the expression of the sulphite resistance gene <italic>SSU1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s003">S3C Fig</xref>).</p><p>We then compared sulphite resistance between the lab strain in which we engineered the translocation (YAF202 corresponding to YAF082 cured for the Cas9 plasmid, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Methods</xref>), the non-translocated parental lab strain (BY4741) and wine isolates that carry or not the translocation of interest (Y9J and DBVPG6765, respectively). Surprisingly, we found that the engineered strain with the translocation was the least resistant of all strains with a Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of 1 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g004">Fig 4</xref>). By comparison, the reference strain and the wine isolate without the translocation both had a MIC of 2 mM. This suggests that the promoter of <italic>ECM34</italic> is weaker than the <italic>SSU1</italic> promoter in the BY background. As expected, the wine isolate with the translocation (Y9J) was the most resistant of all (MIC &#x0003e; 20 mM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g004">Fig 4</xref>), However, it was reported that this wine strain also had four tandem repeats of a 76 bp segment in the promoter region of <italic>SSU1</italic> originating from the <italic>ECM34</italic> locus and it was shown that the number of repeats positively correlated with sulphite resistance [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This suggested that the translocation would not be <italic>per se</italic> responsible for increased resistance. Resistance would in fact result from the repeats in the <italic>ECM34</italic> promoter region that were brought in front of the <italic>SSU1</italic> gene by the translocation. There is only one copy of this 76 bp sequence in the BY background. To test whether promoter repeats were responsible for the resistance phenotype we PCR amplified the repeat-containing promoter of the translocated wine strain Y9J (introducing a point mutation in the PAM sequences to avoid subsequent recognition by Cas9, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s008">S1 Table</xref>) and used the PCR product as donor in a CRISPR experiment to introduce the promoter repeats in front of the <italic>SSU1</italic> gene in the translocated BY4741 strain. We designed a gRNA targeting the region between the single copy motif and the beginning of <italic>SSU1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s008">S1 Table</xref>).

The addition of the repeats in the <italic>SSU1</italic> promoter in the translocated lab strain (YAF158) resulted in increased sulphite resistance with a MIC of 7 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g004">Fig 4</xref>) therefore confirming the effect of the repeats on the resistance phenotype. However, the chromosomal configuration and the promoter repeats are the same in YAF158 and the Y9J wine strain, yet the wine strain is much more resistant than the lab strain suggesting that additional polymorphisms must contribute to the phenotype in the wine isolate.</p><fig id="pgen.1008332.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1008332.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Quantification of sulphite resistance.</title><p>Laboratory and wine strains are symbolized by eppendorf tubes and bottles, respectively.

We reasoned that generating in a single step multiple DSBs targeting Ty repeated sequences should also result in genome reshuffling through multiple translocations without altering any coding sequence or promoter region. We chose a gRNA sequence flanked by a PAM that targets 5 different Ty3 LTR copies located in chromosomes IV, VII, XV and XVI (four of which comprise a region identical to the gRNA target sequence while the fifth copy differs from the target sequence by a single mismatch at its 5' end, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). In addition, there are 30 other complete copies of solo Ty3 LTRs dispersed throughout the genome but they contain several mismatches or indels relatively to the sequence of the gRNA and/or are devoid of PAM, suggesting that Cas9 will not cut at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). We hypothesized that these uncut LTRs would be used as internal donor templates for DSB repair. We chose to target these five Ty3 LTRs because inducing DSB at these locations should allow significant genome reshuffling without compromising to much the viability of the cells by overloading the repair system by too many DSBs. DNA ends originating from the five DSBs can be repaired both in <italic>cis</italic>, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. the two ends from the same DSB are repaired together or in <italic>trans</italic>, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. the two ends from two different DSBs are repaired together. A WT-like karyotype is expected when all DSBs are repaired in <italic>cis</italic> and without any crossover with the internal Ty3 donor templates (type A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).

Note that only reciprocal translocations are expected because the two targeted Ty3 LTRs on chromosome XV are in the same transcriptional orientation and therefore cannot induce the inversion of the intervening segment. In addition, all rearranged karyotypes comprising acentric or dicentric chromosomes are supposedly non-viable and thus will not be recovered. Other combinations of viable karyotypes resulting from both <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> repair with crossovers within uncut LTR donors could also be generated but are hard to predict because of the large number of possible LTR donors that can be used as template for repair and therefore are classified as 'unpredicted' in the following.</p><fig id="pgen.1008332.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1008332.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Induction of multiple rearrangements and phenotypic diversity of reshuffled strains.</title><p><bold>A.</bold> Multiple alignment of the target regions in Ty3 LTR sequences.

We PFGE karyotyped 69 transformants (37 BY4741 and 32 BY4742) out of which 30 showed clear chromosomal rearrangements on the gels, representing 18 different karyotypes in total (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). This result demonstrates that genomes are efficiently reshuffled via our strategy. In total 23 strains showed predicted rearrangements, representing 10 distinguishable profiles (B; D; (F,M,T); G; H; J; (K,N); R; V and X in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>). We validated the presence of all predicted junctions by colony-PCR in only 7 out of the 23 strains. For the other 16 strains, some junctions could not be validated suggesting that additional rearrangements might have occurred (see below). We sequenced all chromosomal junctions in 2 strains that show the most frequently observed rearranged profile (type J in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>) and found that all junctions, from both chimerical and un-rearranged chromosomes, were mutated in their PAM compared to the original target sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). This shows that during shuffling, all targeted sites were cut and repaired using as donor uncut Ty3 LTRs that had no PAM. Additional mutations in the region corresponding to the gRNA target sequence were also observed for 3 junctions, but were too few to identify which copy of the uncut Ty3 LTR was used as donor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). We tested any possible over- or under-representation of the predicted rearranged types by randomly sampling with replacement 15 draws (corresponding to the 15 characterized strains) in a uniform distribution of 18 types (24 types excluding type A (not rearranged) and types (F,M,T) and (K,N) that are not discernible). We performed 10,000 realizations and counted the number of times we sampled the different types. The probability to observe 5 times the predicted type J was 0.017 which suggests that this type could be overrepresented. No other type showed deviation from expectation. However, given the relatively small number of characterized strains, we cannot exclude that DSBs would be repaired in a random way.</p><p>Moreover, we obtained 7 strains with distinct unpredicted karyotypes involving chromosomes other than the 4 targeted ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). For instance, chromosomes XI and XIV that have no PAM sequence associated with their Ty3 LTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) are absent from several karyotypes showing that they can be rearranged in the absence of DSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Surprisingly, some of the karyotypes showed an apparent genome size increase suggesting the presence of unexpected large duplications (see YAF064, YAF126, YAF143 and YAF150 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Using Oxford Nanopore MinION, we sequenced and <italic>de-novo</italic> assembled the genome of YAF064. We characterized in this strain an unequal reciprocal translocation between chromosomes VII and XV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). The junctions corresponded to the targeted CRISPR cut site on chromosome XV but not on chromosome VII. In the chimerical chromosome XVtVII, the junction occurred away from the expected site resulting in a 30 kb increase in DNA content. In the chimerical chromosome VIItXV, the junction also occurred away from the expected site but was accompanied by a truncated triplication of a 110 kb region. The missing part of the triplication corresponds to the 30 kb region found in the reciprocal chromosome XVtVII. The sequencing coverage relatively to the reference genome clearly confirmed the triplication of the complete 110 kb region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). Interestingly the 110 kb segment, composed of regions <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic>, is flanked by two Ty3 LTRs. Moreover, two full length Ty2 retrotransposons are found, one in chromosome XV directly flanking the targeted Ty3 LTR and the other one in chromosome VII at the junction between regions <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s005">S5C Fig</xref>).</p><p>The presence of this triplication as well as partial junction-PCR validation for 16 strains suggested that segmental amplifications might have been missed for strain with predicted types. We Nanopore sequenced and <italic>de novo</italic> assembled the genomes of another 5 strains with different predicted profiles on the CHEF gels ((F,M, T), G, K, H, B). We characterized all rearrangements by read mapping onto the reference genomes and breakpoints were validated by at least 2 reads spanning the junctions. Only one strain showed the predicted genome organization without any additional rearrangement (YAF129, type G). The 4 other strains carried unanticipated rearrangements, ranging from the presence a single additional duplication to more complex rearrangements including multiple events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). All additional rearrangements were flanked by transposable elements, either full length or solo LTRs. Note that these additional rearrangements resulted in karyotypes that were hardly distinguishable from their predicted profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s006">S6 Fig</xref>) showing that CHEF gels are not resolutive enough to precisely predict the chromosomal architecture of reshuffled strains.</p><p>Finally, we also recovered 37 type A strains that had a WT karyotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>). For 35 of them we validated the presence of all un-rearranged junctions by PCR. We sequenced the junctions in 4 independent strains. We found that these strains underwent two different paths within the same experiment. Firstly, 3 clones had all junctions identical to the original LTR sequences with intact PAM, suggesting that Cas9 did not cut the target sites. Secondly, in the fourth clone, the PAM sequences of three sequenced junctions were mutated, showing that the corresponding chromosomes were cut and repaired yet without any rearrangement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). In this clone, one junction could not be amplified, possibly because of a small-sized indel that could not be observed on the PFGE profile.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Exploring the phenotypic diversity of reshuffled strains</title><p>It is well known that strains bearing heterozygous translocations have impaired meiosis resulting in low spore viability [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We checked that crosses between rearranged and parental strains indeed produced few viable spores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). We tested 5 different strains with predicted rearranged karyotypes and PCR-validated junctions, therefore most probably devoid of unanticipated rearrangements. These strains were chosen because they encompassed various rearrangements including reciprocal translocations between 2 and 3 chromosomes (types D, F and G, respectively) and transpositions (types J and K). The 2 control strains without any rearrangement show 81% and 89% of viable spores with most tetrads harbouring 3 to 4 viable spores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). By contrast, all heterozygous diploids had a severely impaired spore viability ranging from 9% to 37% with predominantly 0, 1 or 2 viable spores per tetrad. We observed no clear correlation between the type of rearrangement and the impact on fertility. One strain carrying a single reciprocal translocation between 2 chromosomes (type F) showed the lowest viability, inferior to that of a more rearranged strain with 2 translocations between 3 chromosomes (type G, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). These results show that knowing the type of rearrangements is not sufficient to predict their quantitative impact on meiotic fertility, although they all have a drastic negative effect.</p><p>Secondly, 22 rearranged strains (the 15 predicted and 7 unpredicted karyotypes presented on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5C</xref>) were phenotyped in 40 different growth conditions impacting various physiological processes and in complete synthetic media as the reference condition. These 40 conditions include various types of stresses, different drugs interfering with replication, transcription and translation as well as compounds impacting several subcellular structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s011">S4 Table</xref>). In total, we performed 943 phenotypic measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). We identified about twice as many cases where reshuffled strains grew significantly faster compared to cases where they grew slower than the WT strain (91 and 48 cases, respectively), suggesting that genome shuffling might be advantageous in many stressful conditions. The strongest phenotypic advantages of all corresponded to the strain with the unpredicted karyotype harboring the 110 kb triplication (YAF064, see above) when DNA synthesis is impaired (in the presence of the pyrimidine analog 5-fluorouracile) and in starvation (low carbon concentration 0.01% of galactose or glycerol, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). However, none of 36 triplicated genes with a known function is directly involved either in DNA synthesis or starvation, suggesting that the other 18 uncharacterized genes present in this region could be involved in these phenotypes. More generally, for the conditions that produce the greatest effects, most of the strains tended to react in a similar way. For instance, in the presence of 6-azauracil (6AU), 4NQO and high glucose concentration all the strains that showed a significant phenotypic variation grew slower than the WT while in the presence of galactose, caffeine, cycloheximide and fluconazole all the strains that showed a significant variation grew faster than the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Most strains (19 out of 22) showed variations in at least 2 different conditions showing that genome shuffling is efficiently broadening the phenotypic diversity. The most variable strain, YAF132, presented significant growth variations in 17 out of the 40 conditions (faster and slower than the WT in 15 and 2 conditions, respectively). By opposition, the 2 type J strains (YAF021 and YAF040) as well as one strain with an unpredicted karyotype (YAF135) showed no phenotypic variation in nearly all the 40 conditions. The type G strain devoid of additional rearrangement as validated by sequencing (YAF129, see above) had significant growth variations in 13 conditions, including fitness advantage in many environmental conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec008"><title>Discussion</title><p>There are mounting evidences that SVs play a major role in phenotypic variation [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, these genetic variants are the most difficult to interpret with respect to their functional consequences. In this study, we developed a versatile CRISPR/Cas9-based method allowing to engineer, with the same efficiency as point mutations, both uniquely targeted and multiple reciprocal translocations. Our method therefore provides the possibility to quantify the role played by structural variants in phenotypic diversity in a wide range of environmental conditions and in any genetic background. The versatility of our approach also allows to untangle the phenotypic impact of SVs from that of the genetic background. For instance, sulphite resistance remained lower in the laboratory as compared to the wine isolate even after engineering both the same translocation and promoter repeats at the <italic>SSU1</italic> gene. This strongly suggests that additional polymorphisms such as SNPs also contribute to sulphite resistance in the wine isolate. For instance, there are 4 non-synonymous SNPs in the coding sequence of <italic>SSU1</italic> between the 2 genetic backgrounds. These findings provide a striking example of the advantages brought by our technique to untangle the phenotypic impact of SVs from that of the genetic background.</p><p>Reshuffling the genome with multiple translocations show that the genotypic space accessible by our approach is probably very large. The observed distribution of all predicted types, except type J, was very similar to the expected frequency of each types, suggesting that DSBs were repaired in a random way and that no specific chromosomal contact would be favored during repair. It is interesting to note that type J corresponds to the only chromosomal combination amongst all discernible predicted types where chromosome XVI remains non-rearranged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). The target sequence on chromosome XVI is the only one that contains a mismatch with the gRNA sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), suggesting that even a single mismatch located on the 5' end of the target sequence could be sufficient to decrease the cutting efficiency contrarily to <italic>in vitro</italic> results showing that mismatches at the last two nucleotides at the PAM distal region show similar or even higher cleavage efficiency than that of WT target [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We also isolated strains with rearranged karyotypes different from the 23 predicted profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Translocations involving chromosomes devoid of CRISPR target site are believed to result from crossovers involving uncut LTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The large number of LTRs that can be used for each repair event explains why these karyotypes would be difficult to predict. Moreover, we cannot exclude that some of the unpredicted karyotypes would also result from untargeted LTRs being cut by CRISPR/Cas9. However, this scenario seems very unlikely because all other LTRs are devoid of PAM and/or contain multiple mutations and indels in the target sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Another possible explanation to the presence of unpredicted translocations would be multipartite ectopic recombination between cut and uncut chromosomes where a single end of a DSB can invade multiple sequences located on intact chromosomes during its search for homology leading to translocations between uncut chromosomes by multi-invasion-induced rearrangement [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Surprisingly, more complex rearrangements involving large duplications were frequently recovered, always flanked by transposable sequences, either solo LTR or full-length elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s005">S5 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s006">S6 Fig</xref>), thereby expanding the genomic space accessible by our approach but making the prediction of accessible karyotypes less reliable. These events are consistent with previous finding showing that inducing DSB can trigger the formation of large duplicated segments [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and that BIR can occur by several rounds of strand invasion, DNA synthesis and dissociation within dispersed repeated sequences such as LTRs, leading to chromosome rearrangements [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>We also showed that genome reshuffling generates a great phenotypic diversity under specific environmental conditions including many cases of fitness advantage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Similar findings were previously described both in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, for the first time in this study all rearrangements are completely markerless and scarless (no CRE/Lox site) and at least for the predicted karyotype G (YAF129) no gene was disrupted nor duplicated suggesting that balanced rearrangements between repeated sequences such as Ty3 LTRs, simply reconfiguring the chromosome architecture are sufficient to create fitness diversity. Ty3 LTRs control expression of the Ty3 genomic RNA and have an organization similar to other yeast promoters. Ty3 LTRs contain positive control elements for pheromone induction, negative control elements for mating-type and also pheromone-independent transcriptional activity [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The transcriptional activity of Ty3 LTRs could possibly explain the observed phenotypic diversity associated with genome reshuffling at these sites. Interestingly, the presence of the nucleotide-depleting drug 6AU induces the strongest growth defect of all tested conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Sensitivity to 6AU is a well-documented phenotype associated with transcription-elongation mutants, reducing both the elongation rate and processivity [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], suggesting that transcription might be globally affected in the reshuffled strains. Previous works in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe</italic> revealed that reconfiguring the chromosome structure can alter transcription throughout the genome and not specifically at the rearrangement loci [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Further work is needed to understand the molecular mechanisms at the origin of the phenotypic diversity associated with genome reshuffling.</p><p>Our genome reshuffling procedure is reminiscent of the restructuring technology developed by Muramoto and collaborators [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] that uses a temperature-dependent endonuclease to conditionally induce multiple DSBs in the genome of yeast and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>. However, here by only targeting solo LTRs our reshuffling method has some limitations in the number and types of chromosomal rearrangements that can be produced as all rearrangements that were produced were flanked by transposable element sequences. In addition, we mainly recovered translocations and duplications but deletions and inversions were almost never observed. By comparison, the Cre/Lox based SCRaMbLE technique can generate a much greater genomic diversity by concomitantly inducing recombination at thousands of sites and generating all types of variations, including small and large rearrangements encompassing a single or many genes at a time [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

All plasmids constructed in this study were obtained by cloning in pGZ110 either a 430 bp DNA fragment reconstituting a two-gRNA expression cassette or a 20 bp fragment corresponding to the target sequence of a single gRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). We linearized pGZ110 with the enzyme LguI (ThermoFischer FD1934, isoschizomer SapI from NEB) and gel purified the backbone. In order to clone a single 20 bp target sequence we first annealed two oligonucleotides of 23 bases with 5&#x02019; overhangs of 3 bases complementary to the LguI sites. Annealing was performed by mixing equimolar amounts of forward and reverse oligonucleotides at 100 pmol/&#x003bc;l with NEBuffer 4 (New England Biolabs), heating 5 minutes at 95&#x000b0;C and allowing the mix to cool down slowly to room temperature. We then mixed 100 ng of backbone with 20 pmol of double stranded insert and performed the ligation with the Thermo Fischer Rapid DNA ligation Kit (K1422) according to manufacturer instructions. In order to obtain plasmids with an expression cassette containing two gRNAs, we ordered a 464 bp synthetic DNA fragment composed of a 430 bp sequence containing the target sequence of the first gRNA, its structural component and its terminator sequence followed by the promoter of the second gRNA and its target sequence, flanked by two LguI sites in opposite orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008332.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). This 464 bp DNA fragment was digested with LguI to obtain the 430 bp insert with adequate 5&#x02019; overhangs of 3 bases and gel-purified for ligation in pGZ110. We mixed 100 ng of backbone and 20 ng of insert and performed ligation as explained previously. As an alternative to ordering a synthetic DNA fragment, the double gRNA cassette can easily be PCR amplified using as template any plasmid already containing two gRNAs and two 55 bp oligonucleotides. The first oligo is composed of the LguI site (15 bp), the gRNA target sequence 1 (20 bp) and a homology region to the structural component of the gRNA 1 (20 bp). The second oligo is composed of the LguI site (15 bp), the gRNA target sequence 2 (20 bp) and a homology region to the promoter region of the gRNA 2 (20 bp).

DNA was repaired and dA-tailed using PreCR and FFPE kits (New England Biolabs) and cleaned with Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). SQK-LSK108 adapters were ligated and libraries run on FLO-MIN107 R9.5 flowcells. Raw signals were basecalled locally using Albacore v2.0.2 with default quality filtering. DNA from strains YAF129, YAF140, YAF153, YAF155 and YAF156 was extracted using QIAGEN Genomic-tip 20/G columns, repaired and dA-tailed using FFPE and Ultra II (New England Biolabs) and cleaned with Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). EXP-NBD114 barcodes 13&#x02013;17 and adapters were ligated using Blunt/TA ligase MM and Quick T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). The barcoded library was then run on a FLO-MIN106D R9.4.1 flowcell and locally basecalled using Guppy v2.3.5 with default filtering.

Due to only 19x coverage, the correctedErrorRate for Canu assembly was increased to 0.16. YAF064 was processed using the LRSDAY v1 pipeline [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Linear chromosomes were assembled by SMARTdenovo v1 using 40x coverage of the longest Canu-corrected reads and combined with a Canu assembled mitochondrial genome. For canu correction, due to 200x coverage, correctedErrorRate was set at 0.12. YAF129, YAF140, YAF153, YAF155 and YAF156 reads were pre-processed by porechop and then assembled with SMARTdenovo v1 using Canu-corrected reads. Assembly data are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s010">S3 Table</xref>.</p><p>All corrected reads were aligned against a reference-quality S288C genome, assembled with PacBio reads [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] using LAST-921. At least two split reads were used to highlight structural variations alongside the SMARTdenovo assemblies. Read coverage was used to calculate an increase in the number of copies of particular regions within the rearranged genomes. For YAF019, evidence of rearrangements defined by overlapping reads and changes in copy number were used to manually adjust the assembly prior to nanopolish v0.8.5 and Pilon v1.22 error correction.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Spore viability</title><p>Colonies of rearranged strains originating from the BY background and SK1 strains of the opposed mating type were mixed and spread on the same YPD plate and left overnight at 30&#x000b0;C. The next day, the cells were re-suspended in distilled water and single cells were picked using the Sanger MSM 400 micro-manipulator and left to grow on YPD for 2 days at 30&#x000b0;C until a colony appeared. Colonies originating from single cells were replicated on sporulation medium and left for 4 to 7 days at 30&#x000b0;C until tetrad appeared. For each strain 2 independent diploid clones were dissected on YPD plates and left to grow for 3 days before counting viable spores. For each WT strain we dissected a total of 66 tetrads and between 52 and 56 for the 5 shuffled strains.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>High-throughput phenotyping</title><p>Quantitative phenotyping was performed using endpoint colony growth on solid media. First, strains were grown overnight on liquid YPD medium then pinned onto a solid SC medium with a 1,536 colony per plate density format using robot assisted pinning with ROTOR<sup>&#x02122;</sup> (Singer Instrument) and incubated overnight at 30&#x000b0;C. Once sufficient growth is achieved, the matrix plate is replicated onto 40 media conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s011">S4 Table</xref>) plus SC as a pinning control. Plates were incubated at 30&#x000b0;C (except for the 14&#x000b0;C phenotyping). After 24h, plates were imaged at a 12Mpixel resolution. Quantification of the colony size was performed in R using Gitter [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Raw sizes were corrected using two successive corrections: a spatial smoothing was applied to the colony size [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. This allowed to account for variation of the plate thickness. Another correction was then applied to rescale colony size by row and column [<xref rid="pgen.1008332.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] which is important for colonies lying at the edges of the plate thus having easier access to nutrients compared to strains in the center. All calculations were performed using R. Once the corrected sizes were obtained, the growth ratio of each colony was computed as the colony size on the tested conditions divided by its size on SC. To detect the phenotypic effect of the engineered translocations, each growth ratio has been normalized by the growth ratio of BY4741 or BY4742, depending on the origin of the shuffled strain, on the 40 tested condition. As each strain was present six times, the value considered for its phenotype was the median of all its replicates thus smoothing pinning heterogeneity. Each experiment was repeated 2 times independently in the 40 growth conditions. Correlations between the two replicate experiments are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008332.s007">S7 Fig</xref>. For each replicate experiment and condition, the growth ratios of the 6 colonies of each tested strain were compared to the growth ratio of the reference colonies (BY4741 or BY4742) and a Wilcoxon test was used determined the significance of the phenotypic effect: ***, ** and * indicated that the two p-values from both replicates were lower than 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> and 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Data access</title><p>The Oxford Nanopore sequencing data are deposited in the Sequence Read Archive under the project number PRJNA493199.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1008332.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Sanger sequencing of the translocated junctions in YAF190, YAF192 and de-translocated junctions in strains YAF194, YAF199.</title><p>The sequences corresponding to donor oligonucleotides are shown in bold.
