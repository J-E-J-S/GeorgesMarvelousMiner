The intersecting set of genes, that were found using the gSELEX-Seq and the microarray analysis, had 51 genes.

Identifying the genes regulated by a TF is important for understanding not only the function of the TF but also the gene expression network of the cells. However, since laborious efforts are required to comprehensively identify TF-regulated genes, except for some model TFs, the detailed functions of most TFs are still poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, so far, various methods have been devised for high-throughput identification of genes regulated by a target TF.</p><p id="Par9">DNA microarray (DNA-chip) analysis, which is a comprehensive DNA hybridization technique, was proposed by Brawn et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This technique is mainly applied for simultaneous analysis of the expression of more than thousands of genes. To date, many genes regulated by TFs have been identified using this method in various organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, since DNA microarray analysis gives no information of the TF-binding sites, it is very difficult to distinguish whether the expression of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) is regulated directly or indirectly by a target TF.</p><p id="Par10">On the other hand, systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is a method used for selecting nucleotides that specifically bind to a target from a random sequence pool in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Genomic SELEX (gSELEX), in which the binding sites of a target TF can be preferentially enriched from a genomic library in vitro, enables direct mapping of the TF-binding sites within the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Dror et al. showed that the form of DNA near the consensus motif contributes to the determinant of the TF-binding sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The study suggested that it is important to use genomic libraries rather than synthetic DNA libraries for the identification of TF-binding sequences. Recently, Kojima et al. established a new comprehensive analysis system for transcriptional regulatory networks by using gSELEX-Seq and RNA-Seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This system identified the genes directly regulated by AmyR, a TF from <italic>A. nidulans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

Therefore, 50-bp regions containing the 5&#x02032;-GGCTGA-3&#x02032; in the two promoters were applied to BLI analysis for characterization of the AoXlnR-binding preference (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1). Interestingly, all fragments containing the binding motif analyzed were bound to AoXlnR with nanomolar affinities. The results strongly suggested that all the 5&#x02032;-GGCTGA-3&#x02032; sites in the promoters subject to regulation by AoXlnR.</p><p id="Par37">On the other hand, using gel shift assays, Marui et al. showed that AoXlnR preferentially binds the 5&#x02032;-GGCTAA-3&#x02032; region in the <italic>xynF1</italic> promoter with approximately 10-times higher affinity than that for 5&#x02032;-GGCTGA-3&#x02032; in the promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition, they showed that the 5&#x02032;-GGCTAA-3&#x02032; in the <italic>xynF1</italic> promoter is utilized in vivo for induction by xylan and <sc>d</sc>-xylose more efficiently than the 5&#x02032;-GGCTGA-3&#x02032; site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The results of these previous studies are inconsistent with our findings that the <italic>cis</italic>-element 5&#x02032;-GGCTGA-3&#x02032; is significantly involved in the expression regulation by AoXlnR, comparable to 5&#x02032;-GGCTAA-3&#x02032; (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b).</p><p id="Par38">Of the 29 promoters possessing one or more 5&#x02032;-GGCTGA-3&#x02032; sites among the 72 DEGs identified by microarray analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], most of them (21 promoters) also possessed 5&#x02032;-GGCTAA-3&#x02032; or 5&#x02032;-GGCTAG-3&#x02032; sites. Therefore, we analyzed the correlations between the coexistence of the two kinds of canonical AoXlnR-binding motifs and differential expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Table S4). The analysis showed that the presence of both the 5&#x02032;-GGCTGA-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-GGCTAA-3&#x02032; sites was significantly correlated with differential expression levels (Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation coefficient&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.515, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). By contrast, there was no significant correlation in the case of 5&#x02032;-GGCTAA-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-GGCTAG-3&#x02032; (Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation coefficient&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0632) or 5&#x02032;-GGCTGA-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-GGCTAG-3&#x02032; (Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation coefficient&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.138). The data mining strongly suggests that the coexistence of 5&#x02032;-GGCTGA-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-GGCTAA-3&#x02032; sites in the promoter enhances the expression of genes located downstream of the sites. In fact, the xylan-dependent expression level of a reporter gene decreased moderately by introducing of a point mutation into the 5&#x02032;-GGCTGA-3&#x02032; site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Together, these results suggest that the 5&#x02019;-GGCTGA-3&#x02032; motif might be a <italic>cis</italic>-element that further enhances the transcriptional activation by AoXlnR bound preferentially onto the 5&#x02032;-GGCTAA-3&#x02032; site.</p><p id="Par39">The approach adopted in this study can be used for the analysis of AoXlnR-mediated cellulose and xylan metabolic network. In addition, the information of the correlation between the presence of the AoXlnR motifs and the expression of genes located downstream of the sites can be applied to <italic>A. oryzae</italic> metabolic engineering approaches utilizing cellulose as a starting material. Several synthetic biological approaches with a genetically engineered <italic>A. oryzae</italic> for cellulosic fermentation have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In these approaches, however, several kinds of foreign cellulase genes were introduced into an <italic>A. oryzae</italic> transformant to enhance the cellulase activity. Considering the hypothesis described above, AoXlnR can further activate the expression of a target intrinsic cellulose gene by newly introducing the 5&#x02032;-GGCTGA-3&#x02032; motif into the promoter of the gene. The motif can be inserted at a desired site onto the <italic>A. oryzae</italic> genome by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system of filamentous fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] to increase the cellulase activity of the strain. In principle, this strategy can be applied to various metabolite fermentations using <italic>A. oryzae</italic> as a cell factory. Hence, if our pipeline is combined with the CRISPR/Cas9 system, it may be possible to rationally design a metabolic process in <italic>A. oryzae</italic>.</p><p id="Par40">Recently, Wang et al. performed a genome-wide analysis of TF-binding sites in <italic>A. oryzae</italic> by using DNase I digestion coupled with high-throughput sequencing (DNase-Seq), consequently identifying the binding site of 19 known TFs based on the digestion profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In addition, the authors found that the DNase I cleavage patterns of TFs were consistent with DNA shape features, such as minor groove twist (MGW), propeller twist (ProT), helix twist (HelT), and Roll. In the report, however, the target TF phenotypes were not considered. On the other hand, our pipeline, which integrates both data of in vitro TF-binding characteristics and DEGs, can output not only the genes regulated directly by a TF but also the TF-binding <italic>cis</italic>-elements related closely to the expression of the target genes. A further robust transcriptome analysis system may be established by incorporating the DNA shape features described above as parameters into our pipeline.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par41">In this study, the genes regulated directly by AoXlnR were successfully identified by integrated mining of data obtained from gSELEX-Seq and microarray. The data mining of the promoters of the DEGs showed that the presence of both the canonical AoXlnR-binding motifs, 5&#x02032;-GGCTAA-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-GGCTGA-3&#x02032;, are related significantly to the expression of genes located downstream of the sites. These findings will contribute greatly to the elucidation of AoXlnR-mediated cellulose and xylan metabolic network in <italic>A. oryzae</italic>. In addition, the pipeline, which is based on integrated mining of data consisting of both in vitro characterization of the DNA-binding sites and TF phenotype, can be a robust platform for comprehensive analysis of gene expression network via TFs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>
