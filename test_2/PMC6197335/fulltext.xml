Recently, naturally occurring circular RNAs (circRNAs) were shown to function as efficient miR sponges in cancer cells. We hypothesized that synthetic circRNA sponges could achieve therapeutic loss-of-function targeted against specific miRs. Linear RNA molecules containing miR-21 binding sites were transcribed <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic>; after dephosphorylation and phosphorylation, circularization was achieved using 5&#x02032;-3&#x02032; end-ligation by T4 RNA ligase 1. circRNA stability was assessed using RNase R and fetal bovine serum. Competitive inhibition of miR-21 activity by a synthetic circRNA sponge was assessed using luciferase reporter, cell proliferation, and cell apoptosis assays in three gastric cancer cell lines. circRNA effects on downstream proteins were also delineated by Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labeling (data available via ProteomeXchange identifier PRIDE: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pride:PXD008584" id="intref0010">PXD008584</ext-link>), followed by western blotting. We conclude that artificial circRNA sponges resistant to nuclease digestion can be synthesized using simple enzymatic ligation steps. These sponges inhibit cancer cell proliferation and suppress the activity of miR-21 on downstream protein targets, including the cancer protein DAXX. In summary, synthetic circRNA sponges represent a simple, effective, convenient strategy for achieving targeted loss of miR function <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic>, with potential future therapeutic application in human patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>synthetic circular RNA</kwd><kwd>microRNA sponge</kwd><kwd>microRNA loss-of-function</kwd><kwd>gastric carcinoma</kwd><kwd>molecular therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Gastric carcinoma (GC) remains the fifth most common cancer and the third highest cause of cancer death worldwide, with 984,000 new cases and 841,000 deaths in 2013.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Most GC cases are diagnosed at late stages with consequent poor outcomes, for which treatment is largely restricted to cytotoxic chemotherapy.

The term &#x0201c;MvA&#x0201d; is standard shorthand for minus <italic>versus</italic> average, a standard graphic plot to depict expression comparisons for amino or nucleic acid analyses. Minus is the difference between two biological conditions determined by subtracting (division in log world) the control signal from the case signal. Average is the geometric mean of the case&#x02019;s and control&#x02019;s log signals. In this case, our signals were the quantile-normalized log2 values derived from mass spectrometric analysis software (Proteome Discoverer) output. In practice, the MvA y axis is the log2 fold change between the two biological conditions, in this case the samples&#x02019; underlying genotypes. It is also called the log ratio. Thus, the zero value for log2 represents no difference. The x axis represents the average of both case&#x02019;s and control&#x02019;s normalized log2 signals in simple log2 notation. This can be thought of as depicting the full dynamic range of the underlying mass spectrometry platform.

The marked observed stability of synthetic circRNA against two different nuclease digestion regimens emphasizes this key theoretical advantage of synthetic circRNAs as potential therapeutic agents. We also found that gastric carcinoma cell proliferation was inhibited, and that expression of DAXX, a key tumor suppressor gene that is also a known direct miR-21 target,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> was upregulated by a synthetic circRNA sponge.

Additional proteins, including GRB2, PPP1CC, CDC42SE2, SARAF, DUT, and RPRD1B, were increased at 24&#x000a0;hr post-scRNA-21 transfection: these additional proteomic changes further support the substantial biologic effects of this synthetic circRNA. These additional proteins merit further investigation in future circRNA experiments but are beyond the scope of the current initial exploratory study.</p><p id="p0090">We draw several conclusions from the current study. First, to our knowledge, we have directly created the first artificial circRNAs containing multiple bulged oncomiR miR-21 binding sites by enzymatic ligation and synthesis <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic>. Second, we show that this synthetic circRNA is more resistant to nuclease degradation than its linear counterpart RNA. Third, we demonstrate that this synthetic circRNA functions actively as a miR-21 sponge, suppressing the posttranscriptional regulatory activity of miR-21 and increasing the expression of miR-21 downstream proteins, while also inhibiting GC cell proliferation. Notably, circRNA sponges can be synthesized in large quantities using simple and easily controllable steps. However, several potential drawbacks still exist, and additional troubleshooting may be required for broader application of this strategy. For example, we used enzymatic ligation for circularization of <italic>short</italic> RNAs (&#x0003c;500 nucleotides); circularization of larger RNAs may be challenging. Second, due to varying base composition and the terminal heterogeneity associated with <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> transcription, the yield of ligation for circularization may vary for each gene. To achieve higher circRNA purity, RNase R digestion followed by gel purification of RNA may be useful. Third, RNA transfection protocols, such as the RNA-plasmid co-transfection steps, need to be further optimized. Fourth, we and others<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> suggested that when using luciferase reporter assays to determine sponge effectiveness, it may be preferable to design two to three different oligonucleotide single strands containing different base compositions and to then choose the strand exhibiting the highest effectiveness. In future studies, we will confirm effects of scRNA21 on tumor growth, investigate mechanisms underlying scRNA21 activity, and evaluate scRNA21 toxicity in animal models. Notwithstanding these potential pitfalls, and considering the crucial role of oncomiRs in tumorigenesis and tumor progression, these results for the first time, to our knowledge, reveal enormous promise of synthetic circRNA sponges as novel tools for anticancer research and future molecular therapy.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Differential miR-21 Expression in TCGA Patients</title><p id="p0095">446 GC and 45 normal samples with miR sequence data were retrieved from the TCGA data portal.
