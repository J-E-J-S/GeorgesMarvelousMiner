We report a single nucleotide deletion mutation that developed in the &#x003bb;-repressor cI within a synthetic genetic NOT gate in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> during growth and through this mutation, a non-functional synthetic gene circuit became functional. This mutation resulted in a frame-shifted cI, which showed effective functionality among genetic NOT-gates in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> with high regulatory ranges (&#x0003e;&#x02009;300) and Hill coefficient (&#x0003e;&#x02009;6.5). The cI worked over a large range of relative copy numbers between the frame-shifted gene and its target promoter. These properties make this frame-shifted gene an excellent candidate for building synthetic gene circuits. We hypothesized a new operating mechanism and showed evidence that frame-shifted cI was translated from non-natural start codon. We have engineered and tested a series of NOT gates made from a library of cI genes, each of which starts from a different codon within the first several amino acids of the frame-shifted cI. It is found that one form with start codon ACA, starting from the 3rd codon had similar repression behavior as the whole frame-shifted gene. We demonstrated synthetic genetic NAND and NOR logic-gates with frame-shifted cI. This is the first report of synthetic-gene-circuits made from a frame-shifted gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">This study inspires a new view on frame-shifted gene and may serve as a novel way of building and optimizing synthetic-gene-circuits.

First we made a minimal AND gate by designing, constructing and testing a hybrid synthetic promoter P<sub>LTATAA</sub>. This hybrid promoter can be repressed by both LacI and TetR proteins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c) and thus always becomes repressed in DH5&#x003b1;Z1 cell and can only be activated in the simultaneous presence of aTc and Isopropyl &#x003b2;-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), which allosterically binds to LacI and frees the operator sites in the promoter. The design of this hybrid promoter was based on a previous design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] but used different distances between operator sites, positions and numbers of transcription factor (TF) binding sites (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). EGFP was placed under this promoter and its successful AND logic behavior was tested (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d).</p><p id="Par21">Next, to make a NAND logic system (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e), the output gene EGFP of this AND gate was replaced with the frame-shifted cI, placed in a medium copy plasmid (ColE1 ori) and co-transformed with P<sub>R</sub>-<italic>EGFP</italic> construct (p15A ori) into DH5&#x003b1;Z1 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e).

Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f showed the NAND logic behavior, where the output signal is off only when both input signals are present. The difference between OFF and ON states for both NOR and NAND gate were ~&#x02009;40 times.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par22">The &#x003bb; repressor cI with P<sub>R</sub> promoter has been used for constructing several gene circuits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, the strength of the associated RBS generally needs to be reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. We showed that even a basal level leakage of wild type cI from fully repressed pLtetO-1 promoter was enough to repress the P<sub>R</sub> promoter completely. Thus NOT gates made from wild type cI were nonfunctional. However, the function of the NOT gates were rescued when the frame shifted cI was used. The NOT gates constructs created in this study showed high fold change, ultrasensitivity (large Hill coefficient) and normal growth rate as per the best transcriptional NOT gates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] reported. However, a promoter- repressor pair in a gene circuit may not work effectively in other circuits if there is a mismatch in their relative copy numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Similarly, the dynamic range of a specific circuit may not match with the downstream promoter-gene pairs within a larger circuit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In those cases, tedious transcriptional and/or translational optimization is often required to match the [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] cellular availability of a repressor genes with respect to the promoters. Here, we have shown that, frame-shifted cI can work over a large range of plasmid copy numbers, as evident from the Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, which shows successful repression behavior even when the relative numbers of plasmid copy separately carrying frame-shifted cI and its target promoter are varied in all possible ways (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This is one of the most attractive properties of this frame-shifted cI, which most of the other known transcription factor-promoter pairs lack. We think this property of frame-shifted cI originates from the inefficient translation from the non-natural start codons. The inefficient translation would not allow the (truncated) cI protein to reach the saturated level even when we used high copy number plasmid (please see below for more details). Synthetic genetic NOR and NAND gates with frame-shifted cI were successfully demonstrated. The ultrasensitivity observed in those logic circuits is as per the standard transcriptional logic gates reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It isimportant to note that, in all synthetic gene circuits described here, frame-shifted cI were used with strong promoter and RBS unlike wild type cI found in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">This single nucleotide deleted, frame-shifted &#x003bb; repressor cI was produced spontaneously during growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> carrying wild type cI. We hypothesized and showed evidence that frame-shifted cI became functional by producing truncated version of cI translated from non-natural start codons. It suggests a new mechanism of rescued functionality from a frame-shifted gene. It was previously observed that cI proteins with inserted random linkers in early positions of N-terminal regions showed high to low repression ability against P<sub>L</sub> promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, no studies were performed by replacing or removing AUG (ATG) start codon. The start codons used in our study do not belong to the other lesser used and rare but known start codons in bacteria like GUG, UUG, CUG, AUU, AUC and AUA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Thus we defined them as non-natural start codons. A recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] showed that translation with varied rate can be achieved with various non natural start codons in super folder green fluorescence protein (sfGFP), which was placed under T7 promoter in <italic>E.coli</italic> and ACA start codon resulted in a decrease of ~&#x02009;1200 (in rich defined media) and ~&#x02009;5000 (in LB media) in sfGFP expression compared to the AUG. Further, the position of this non-natural start codon in frame-shifted cI was 11 nucleotides away from the RBS, which was within the limit for good translation initiation rate in bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This suggested that the frame-shifted cI resulted in functional truncated cI, translating from non-natural ACA codon and its number in the <italic>E. coli</italic> was reduced proportionally in comparison to wild type cI to give repression with good dynamic range. This was also supported by the observation that we found higher cellular growth rate with frame-shifted cI than wild type cI (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). We reasoned that low amount of truncated but functional cI did not exert high metabolic load, thus it has negligible effect on growth rate.</p><p id="Par24">In our study, we had two interesting observations. First the mutation gave an adaptive advantage as evident from the fact that in induced condition, the plasmids carrying frame-shifted cI had higher growth rate than the plasmid carrying wild type cI. Second, this is an example, where non-directed mutation makes a non-functional gene circuit into a functional one.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par25">Taken together, our work suggests a new view on a frame-shifted gene in the light of non-natural start codons and inspires future exploration of using frame-shifted genes and non-natural start codons as a new axis for building and optimizing gene expression in synthetic genetic circuits. Further, as this frame-shifted cI requires almost no alteration in its transcription and translation rateswithin a large range of plasmid copy numbers, it could be a better alternative to wild type cI for constructing synthetic gene circuits. This study raises interesting questions about non-directed evolution of synthetic genetic circuits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Promoters, primers, genes, plasmids and bacterial cell strains</title><p id="Par26">Three base plasmids pTA1EGFP, pTA2EGFP and pTC3EGFP were prepared (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5).
