Fifty handlers (18.5%) had one or more symptoms that were consistent with tuberculosis (cough for &#x0003e;2 weeks, fever, night sweats and/or weight loss). These individuals had sputum samples taken for culture, 6 of whom were culture-positive for <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>. Twenty-one cattle (12.6%) were positive for the comparative intradermal test (CIT) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), four of whom died during the study period and underwent post-mortem examination. All four had extensive visible tuberculous lesions in the lungs, spleen, liver and lymph nodes. Lesions typically appeared yellowish, caseous and necrotic with grey fibrous tissue. Pre-scapular and mesenteric lymph nodes contained calcified tubercles, lung tissue had palpable tubercles ~0.5 to 1.0&#x02009;cm in diameter, and two animals had tuberculous mastitis. Lung tissue samples from all 4 animals were smear positive for acid-fast bacilli on ZN staining. Cultured isolates were identified as <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> based on spoligotyping; <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> was not isolated. The human and livestock cases of tuberculosis occurred on two of the three farms (termed farm 1 and farm 2). Phenotypic susceptibility testing of the 10 isolates showed that 9 were susceptible to rifampicin, isoniazid, streptomycin and ethambutol, and one isolate (from cattle) was resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Spoligotyping classified all isolates as East-African Indian (EAI) spoligotype Lineage 1 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), which is prevalent in South India.

A whole genome SNP based phylogenetic tree was constructed to evaluate the genetic relatedness among the study isolates, which demonstrated several clusters (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Pairwise comparison of the 10 genomes identified a SNP difference that ranged from 1 to 600 SNPs, but 3 isolate pairs were less than 5 SNPs different (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Both species triggered strong cell-mediated immune responses, but post-mortem examination at 17 weeks only revealed visible pathology indicative of tuberculosis in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic>-infected animals.

Both isolates of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> caused comparable pathology, which was significantly lower than that caused by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">Despite these controlled experimental data, our findings of active <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection in cattle associated with gross pathology shows that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> can both infect and cause pathology in a natural environment. Numerous lines of evidence confirmed that infection was due to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> rather than <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic>, including whole genome sequence data that unequivocally placed cattle-associated isolates within a lineage that is the most common cause of human tuberculosis in southern India. Furthermore, the pathological findings on post-mortem examination performed shortly after death were consistent with active tuberculosis. This included visible pathology in the lung, spleen, lymph nodes and udder. There are several possible explanations for the discrepant findings between model systems and the natural environment. First, only some <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> strains may be able to cause disease in cattle, including those not tested to date in experimental models. <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv and BTB1558 both reside in lineage 4 and are genetically distinct from the lineage 1 isolates identified in our study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Second, in experimental models a single dose is given but in natural infection, repeated exposure is likely from infected handlers; route of infection may also be different. Third, experimental models are time limited but in natural infection, livestock may survive for more extended periods of time during which disease may develop and progress. There are also likely to be differences in the age of cattle; experimental animals are used at six months of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, while livestock may reach a more advanced age prior to exposure. Finally, there could be variation in susceptibility between different cattle species.</p><p id="Par10">The use of whole genome sequencing allowed us to examine the relatedness of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> from cattle and their handlers. We detected three isolate pairs that were highly related (&#x02264;4 SNPs different), of which two pairs were from handlers and one was from cattle. Based on this degree of relatedness, it is possible that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> transmission occurred between handlers, either directly or through an intermediate host. It is also possible that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> was transmitted between two cattle who shared a highly related strain, but an alternative possibility is that both animals were infected by a handler who was not captured in this study. We noted that the closest genetic distance between an isolate from cattle and humans was more than 250 SNPs different, which is consistent with an under-sampled population in which not all cases were captured at the time of our investigation. Further evidence for under-sampling was the isolation from cattle of a <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> isolate that was multidrug-resistant, which was not detected in human isolates. The wider phylogenetic analysis including lineage 1&#x02009;<italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> genomes from humans including those from Chennai revealed that isolates from our study were distributed across the phylogeny. The three highly related isolate pairs from our study each remained clustered but were in different parts of the tree, consistent with independent acquisition/transmission events.</p><p id="Par11">The duration of infection in the 4 cattle is not known, but the gross pathology consistent with tuberculosis at the time of post-mortem examination suggests that they were infected for several years.
