    "Cancer is a disease largely caused by genomic aberrations. Utilizing many rapidly emerging sequencing technologies, researchers have studied cancer genomes to understand the molecular statuses of cancer cells and to reveal their vulnerabilities, such as driver mutations or gene expression. Long-read technologies enable us to identify and characterize novel types of cancerous mutations, including complicated structural variants in haplotype resolution. In this review, we introduce three representative platforms for long-read sequencing and research trends of cancer genomics with long-read data. Further, we describe that aberrant transcriptome and epigenome statuses, namely, fusion transcripts, as well as aberrant transcript isoforms and the phase information of DNA methylation, are able to be elucidated by long-read sequencers. Long-read sequencing may shed light on novel types of aberrations in cancer genomics that are being missed by conventional short-read sequencing analyses."
