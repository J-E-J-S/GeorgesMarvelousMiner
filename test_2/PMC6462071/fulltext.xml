As a vector of several destructive plant viruses, this tiny hemipteran insect poses a worldwide threat to the productivity of many crops (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Several traits have been implicated in its chronic invasiveness (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). One of the most intriguing traits is the insect&#x02019;s apparent ability to induce a plant response that is usually triggered by an attack by a biotrophic pathogen instead of triggering a typical response to insect attack. This leads to the activation of defenses that are effective against pathogens at the cost of defenses that are effective against insects, thereby rendering the plant more suitable and vulnerable to whitefly attack (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). More specifically, upon continuous whitefly infestation, plants predominantly mobilize a defense that is mediated by salicylic acid (SA; refs. <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In some plants, whitefly attack initially also triggers jasmonic acid (JA)-regulated responses (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), but in tomato plants JA levels decline within days, whereas the accumulation of SA and the expression of SA-regulated genes gradually increase (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The reduction in JA-dependent defenses makes the plants more susceptible to insects, including whiteflies (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Plants also respond to insect feeding with the production and release of specific blends of volatiles. These herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) can serve various functions (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), including a direct defense with toxic and repellent effects on the herbivore (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and an indirect defense by attracting natural enemies of herbivores (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). More important in the context of this study, HIPVs also serve as signals that provide information on imminent insect attack to undamaged plant tissues (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), as well as neighboring plants (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Upon perception of certain HIPVs, neighboring plants prepare for attack, a phenomenon called priming (<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). When these primed neighbors are attacked themselves by the same herbivore, they will respond more rapidly and strongly with an appropriate defense reaction. It is, as yet, unclear how specific these priming responses are, but it is to be expected that HIPVs will prime for defenses against herbivores and that volatile blends that are triggered by pathogen attack will prime for defenses against pathogens (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Whitefly infestation results in a blend that is more representative of pathogen attack than of insect attack (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Here, we show that perception of this whitefly-induced blend by neighboring plants results in a response that renders the neighbors more suitable hosts for whitefly development. This result implies that by manipulating its host&#x02019;s volatile signals whiteflies may enhance the suitability of neighboring host plants for their offspring.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="s1"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2"><title>Exposing Tomato Plants to Whitefly-Induced Plant Volatiles.</title><p>In a number of systems, it has been shown that HIPVs can be perceived by neighboring plants and prime these plants to prepare themselves for incoming attack, rendering the neighbors more resistant to the inducing herbivore (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Whitefly-infested plants emit volatile blends that are distinct from volatile blends emitted by plants infested by other arthropods (<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), and the induction of these volatiles is mediated by the SA signaling pathway (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). To test if neighboring plants respond to these volatiles, we first conducted a series of experiments to determine if exposure to whitefly-induced volatiles affects a plant&#x02019;s suitability as a host for whiteflies. Using interconnected glass chambers, each holding two tomato plants, we exposed healthy tomato plants to the volatiles released by whitefly-infested plants (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1818599116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S1</ext-link>). The oviposition rates and performance of whiteflies on these exposed plants were compared with control plants that had been exposed to the volatiles of healthy plants.</p><p>The number of eggs laid by females that were placed on the plants did not significantly differ between plants exposed for 24 h to volatiles from uninfested plants or to volatiles from plants that had been infested by whiteflies for 1, 3, 5, or 7 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). However, the development rate of nymphs on these plants was considerably different between the treatments. The proportion of fourth-instar nymphs was significantly higher on plants that had been exposed to volatiles from plants that had been infested by whiteflies for 5 or 7 d, compared with plants that had been exposed to volatiles from uninfested plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). This was not the case after exposure to volatiles from infested plants for 1 or 3 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). These data imply that tomato plants become more susceptible to <italic>B. tabaci</italic> after exposure to volatiles from whitefly-infested plants.

Genes encoding for proteinase inhibitors I and II (<italic>PI-I</italic> and <italic>PI-II</italic>) are regulated by JA signaling and confer insect resistance in many solanaceous plants, including tomato (<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The tomato gene <italic>Mi-1.2</italic> is responsible for resistance against whiteflies (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). <italic>PR-1a</italic> and <italic>PR-1b</italic> are known as SA-triggered pathogenesis-related (PR) genes in tomato (<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Without further plant treatment, none of these genes showed an enhanced expression after exposure to plant volatiles, be it from control or whitefly-infested plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). This was considerably different for plants that were infested with whitefly adults after the exposure.

In whitefly-infested plants, <italic>PI-II</italic> and <italic>Mi-1.2</italic> showed similar patterns of suppression after exposure to volatiles from infested plants, but this was only evident after 12 h of infestation for <italic>PI-II</italic> and after 24 h of infestation for <italic>Mi-1.2</italic>. <italic>PR-1a</italic> and <italic>PR-1b</italic> showed stronger induction after exposure to volatiles from infested plants, but this was only evident after 24 h of infestation for <italic>PR-1a</italic> and after 12 and 24 h of infestation for <italic>PR-1b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results imply that exposure to the volatiles from whitefly-infested plants causes an overall suppression of JA-dependent defense responses in tomato plants, which is only evident when the exposed plants are challenged by whiteflies. This priming effect renders the plants more suitable as hosts for whiteflies. To test if this phenomenon is specific for whitefly infestation, we next conducted a series of experiments to compare the volatile emissions of whitefly-infested tomato plants with volatiles released by plants under attack by caterpillars or a bacterial pathogen (see details in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1818599116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic></ext-link>). In addition, we assessed their respective effects on neighboring plants to test our hypothesis that whitefly-induced volatiles are indicative of pathogen infection and therefore prime resistance to pathogens at the cost of defenses against insects.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Volatiles Emitted from Infested or Infected Plants.</title><p>Volatiles were collected from healthy tomato plants and plants that had either been infested by whiteflies (150 adults for 1, 3, 5 or 7 d), infested by caterpillars of the moth <italic>Spodoptera exigua</italic> (five second-instar caterpillars for 24 or 48 h), or infected by the bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic> DC3000 (<italic>Pst</italic> DC3000) for 24 or 48 h. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis detected a total of 17 major compounds that were consistently released, depending on the treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). Quantitative analysis showed that the amounts of the monoterpene (<italic>E</italic>)-&#x003b2;-ocimene and of an unknown sesquiterpene released from plants infested with <italic>B. tabaci</italic> for 1 and 3 d, respectively, were significantly lower than the amounts released from uninfested plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1818599116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table S2</ext-link>). Significant increases in the emission of the monoterpenes &#x003b2;-myrcene and &#x003c1;-cymene, and of the sesquiterpene &#x003b2;-caryophyllene, only started 5 d after initial infestation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). Caterpillar feeding and bacterial infection resulted in considerably faster changes in the release of volatiles by the tomato plants and, surprisingly, all three attackers induced a qualitatively distinct blend.

Indeed, as shown above, the blend emitted by caterpillar-damaged plants was quite different. The question that remains is whether plants that perceive this &#x0201c;correct&#x0201d; blend of volatiles respond in a manner that enhances their resistance against herbivores, including whiteflies. We tested this and indeed found that the priming effects elicited by <italic>S. exigua</italic>-induced volatiles enhance a defense response that is effective against <italic>S. exigua</italic> caterpillars and whiteflies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>). Plants were first exposed for 24 h to volatiles from caterpillar-infested plants or to volatiles from undamaged plants. Then the exposed plants were damaged with a razor blade and caterpillar regurgitant was applied to the damaged sites to mimic herbivore attack (<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In contrast to whitefly-induced volatiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>), caterpillar-induced volatiles primed a stronger accumulation of JA levels in exposed plants, whereas SA levels remained largely unaffected in exposed plants that were damaged and treated with caterpillar regurgitant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). This difference was also found for the expression of genes that are involved in plant defenses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>), with a much higher early expression of <italic>PI-I</italic> and <italic>PI-II</italic> in plants that had been exposed to the volatiles of caterpillar-damaged plants. Again, this was the opposite of what was observed for plants exposed to volatiles from whitefly-infested plants, which showed a suppression of all three genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). This priming of JA defenses was further reflected in the weight gain of second-instar <italic>S. exigua</italic> larvae reared on leaves of exposed plants. Weight gain was more than 40% lower on plants that had been exposed to volatiles from <italic>S. exigua</italic>-infested plants compared with larval weight gain on leaves of plants exposed to volatiles from uninfested plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>).

They mainly rely on a diverse arsenal of defense mechanisms that have antiherbivore and/or antimicrobial properties. However, many specialized herbivores and pathogens are able to overcome and sometimes manipulate these defenses and can thrive on their specific host plants. Here, we show that volatile emissions are also vulnerable to manipulation. The generalist whitefly <italic>B. tabaci</italic> induced plants into producing a volatile blend that evokes neighboring plants to down-regulate JA-dependent defenses, and this coincides with the enhanced performance of <italic>B. tabaci</italic> nymphs. We also observed these plants to display a stronger SA response, which is assumed to cause a down-regulation of JA responses (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), but this is not always evident (<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) and remains to be determined for tomato. We conducted a supplementary experiment that excludes the possibility that odor emitted from whiteflies themselves is involved in the suppression of JA-dependent defenses and the induction of SA-dependent defenses (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1818599116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S6</ext-link>). Taken together, these findings imply that the whitefly-induced volatiles affect neighboring tomato plants in a way that makes them more suitable as a host for the next generation of whiteflies.</p><p>Interestingly, the volatile blends induced by the three attackers were all distinctly different, but the three volatiles that were significantly induced by whitefly infestation were also present in the pathogen-induced blend while they were not induced by the caterpillars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). We found these compounds also in the blends released by two other tomato varieties in response to whitefly infestation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1818599116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S4 and Table S5</ext-link>). Exposure to these compounds (&#x003b2;-myrcene or &#x003b2;-caryophyllene) indeed enhanced SA-dependent responses and suppressed JA-dependent responses upon insect attack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>). It should be noted that these compounds are constitutively emitted by tomato plants and that the release of &#x003b2;-caryophyllene in particular is highly variable among tomato lines (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Our study confirms this with the variety Moneymaker having low constitutive emissions (1.9 ng&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and the two other studied varieties having higher constitutive emission of &#x003b2;-caryophyllene (Zhefen 302: 18.6 ng&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; Zheza 809: 19.8 ng&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Despite this variability, it seems to be a reliable &#x0201c;priming&#x0201d; signal, as each of the three varieties significantly increased its release of &#x003b2;-caryophyllene in response to whitefly infestation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1818599116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S4<italic>B</italic></ext-link>), whereas caterpillar attack had no effect on &#x003b2;-caryophyllene emission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). It appears that &#x003b2;-caryophyllene itself does not serve as a defense against whiteflies (<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) but does provide protection against a bacterial pathogen (<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). It will be worth testing if &#x003b2;-caryophyllene&#x02013;mediated priming provides protection against the viruses transmitted by whiteflies.</p><p>Similar to &#x003b2;-caryophyllene, &#x003b2;-myrcene is known to be controlled by the JA pathway in other plant species. For instance, in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, it is a product of <italic>At</italic>-TPS 10 and is up-regulated upon treatment with Me-JA, but also SA or whitefly infestation (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). In tomato, however, LeMTS2, which was identified as a &#x003b2;-myrcene synthase, is not affected by JA treatment (<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). This is consistent with our results, implying that it is controlled by SA and serves as a priming signal in tomato that is characteristic for pathogen infection. Exposure to other volatiles that were typical for pathogen induction also enhanced SA-dependent defenses (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1818599116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S3</ext-link>), whereas caterpillar feeding induced the release of volatiles that primed the JA pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1818599116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S2</ext-link>).</p><p>These findings have major implications for our understanding of plant&#x02013;insect and plant&#x02013;pathogen interactions. They demonstrate high specificity in the information carried by the inducible volatile blends and indicate that plants use this information to launch a specific response to their attackers. Apparently, <italic>B. tabaci</italic> is able to interfere with this information transfer, which could be an important reason why this and other whitefly species have been so successful as invasive pests. The plant response may, however, be adaptive if priming of the SA pathway enhances its resistance to the harmful viruses that are commonly transmitted by whiteflies (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). This remains to be determined. It can also not be fully excluded that microorganisms, e.g., bacteria, are involved in the induction of the typical SA up-regulation in response to whitefly infestation. However, each of these possible induction scenarios clearly favors the performance and propagation of the whitefly and may have facilitated its invasiveness and rapid spread. Finally, it would be interesting to study if the original host plants of <italic>B. tabaci</italic>, which so far remain unknown (<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), have coevolved adaptations and show different, perhaps more fitting responses to whitefly attacks.</p><p>The observed specificity in odor-mediated defense responses also has important applied implications, as a thorough understanding of the mechanisms and signals that are involved in these plant&#x02013;plant interactions may lead to strategies that exploit the odorous alert signals to enhance crop resistance (<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). For instance, selecting crop varieties that have a more appropriate response to whitefly-induced volatiles may greatly reduce their susceptibility to whiteflies. Alternatively, breeding or otherwise creating varieties that, in responses to whitefly attack, give off volatiles that trigger JA-dependent defenses in nearby leaves may show enhanced resistance against whiteflies.</p><p>This study also shows that different pests trigger the release of distinct volatile &#x0201c;odor-prints.&#x0201d; This high specificity provides information that is of use to the plant and associated organisms, but this specificity could also be exploited for crop monitoring if we can develop odor sensors that can capture this specificity (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Considering the very rapid changes in volatile blends, such sensory systems may alert farmers to the presence of a pest or disease long before any damage is visible and control measures would still be effective. Similar to whiteflies, we may be able to exploit the sophisticated odorous language of plants to optimize the quality of crop plants for consumption by future generations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s7"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s8"><title>Plants and Insects.</title><p>Tomato plants (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>; cv.

For quantification purposes, [9, 10]-dihydro-JA (15 ng; Sigma-Aldrich) and D6-SA (20 ng) were added as internal standards with 2 mL of 80% methanol. JA, SA, and the internal standards were partitioned to an aqueous phase by centrifugation and vaporization. Subsequently, they were extracted from the aqueous phase with an equal volume of ethyl acetate and then dried. The dried extract was resuspended in 0.1 M acetic acid and loaded onto a C18 column (Waters Company). The C18 column was sequentially eluted with a series of solvent mixtures [acetic acid/methanol (vol/vol) at 83/17, 60/40, and 40/60].
