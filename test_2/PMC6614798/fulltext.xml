While artificial transcription factors are emerging as powerful tools for gene activation within a natural chromosomal context, current generations often exhibit relatively weak, variable, or unpredictable activity across targets. To address these limitations, we developed a novel system for gene activation, which bypasses native promoters to achieve unprecedented levels of transcriptional upregulation by integrating synthetic promoters at target sites. This gene activation system is multiplexable and easily tuned for precise control of expression levels. Importantly, since promoter vector integration requires just one variable sgRNA to target each gene of interest, this procedure can be implemented with minimal cloning. Collectively, these results demonstrate a novel system for gene activation with wide adaptability for studies of transcriptional regulation and cell line engineering.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">American Heart Association</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000968</named-content></funding-source><award-id>17SDG33650087</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Institutes of Health</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id>R01GM127497</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Science Foundation</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000001</named-content></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1746047</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The activation of endogenous genes with artificial transcription factors (ATFs) is an enticing technology, not only for developing gene therapies or disease models (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), but also for interrogating gene function through genome-wide screenings (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). ATFs consist of a programmable DNA binding domain that can be customized to target a transcriptional activation domain to the appropriate locus for upregulation of gene expression. While zinc finger proteins (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and Transcriptional Activator-Like Effectors (TALEs) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;9</xref>) have been used for gene activation, the RNA guided nuclease (RGN) platform (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;16</xref>) is arguably the most popular since the DNA binding specificity can be engineered rapidly and at low cost (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;22</xref>). CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) activation or CRISPRa, requires a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) and catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) coupled with a transcriptional activator. First generation transcriptional activators, which typically used VP64 or VP16 activation domains, required multiple ATFs acting in synergy near the transcriptional start site (TSS) of the gene of interest for optimal gene activation (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). This important limitation is lessened when using second-generation transcriptional activators, including VP160 (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), SAM (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), VPR (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), SunTag (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), VP64-dCas9-BFP-VP64 (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), Scaffold (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>)&#x000a0;and P300 (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), which are capable of activating expression of some target genes when used individually.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is becoming evident that even second generation CRISPRa technologies are often limited by their need for multiple sgRNAs to achieve adequate activation of many genes (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and the lack of established parameters to best position ATFs within endogenous promoters for effective upregulation of gene expression. Importantly, CRISPRa systems often fail at activating genes whose expression is tightly regulated. These constraints limit widespread adoption of CRISPRa for applications in synthetic biology, tissue engineering or gene therapy.</p><p>In these studies, we sought to develop an alternative architecture that bypasses the limitations of current platforms for activating native genes. We reasoned that, since genomic context at the promoter greatly impacts output expression when using ATFs, it might be possible to circumvent this problem through insertion of a synthetic promoter near the TSS of target genes. This system would not only override negative regulatory elements, but would also be highly customizable, given the existing assortment of well-characterized synthetic promoters capable of both constitutive and chemically inducible gene expression.</p><p>In this manuscript, we utilized a universal vector integration platform (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) to engineer a synthetic system for activating endogenous genes. To this end, we describe how this platform enables rapid, robust and inducible activation of both individual and multiplexed gene transcripts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>293T, HCT116 and Neuro-2A cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

NAVI can be rapidly adapted to integrate heterologous DNA at virtually any locus via two simultaneous DSBs: first in the genome, guided by a primary sgRNA, and second within the targeting vector (TV), guided by a universal secondary sgRNA (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The TV is then integrated into the genomic locus through Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ). This platform is universal since vector integration at any target site can be simply accomplished by customizing the primary sgRNA. To develop a universal system of NAVI-based gene activation (NAVIa), we designed two vectors for constitutive expression and one vector for inducible expression.</p><p>The two constitutive vectors contain either one CMV promoter followed by a target site for a universal secondary sgRNA (constitutive single promoter targeting vector, cspTV) or two opposing constitutive promoters separated by the secondary sgRNA target site (constitutive dual promoter targeting vector, cdpTV), each containing a cassette for expression of the puromycin <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-transferase gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The targeting vector for inducible expression (inducible dual promoter targeting vector, idpTV) includes two identical promoters in opposite orientations, each consisting of seven TetO repeats and a minimal CMV promoter (mCMV). The idpTV also carries a puromycin N-acetyl-transferase gene linked with a reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) via a T2A peptide. As in the cdpTV, the opposing promoters of the idpTV flank a universal secondary sgRNA target sequence. A DSB introduced in either idpTV or cdpTV by Cas9 generates a linear fragment of DNA with diametric promoters oriented towards the free ends of the vector (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The architecture of the dual promoter TV ensures that there is always a promoter correctly positioned regardless of integration orientation, thereby addressing NAVI&#x02019;s lack of directionality.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>NAVIa Activation of Native Gene Expression is Tunable and Surpasses CRISPRa. (<bold>A</bold>) The architecture of the NAVIa system includes a plasmid containing a human codon-optimized expression cassette for active Cas9, which is co-transfected with two separate sgRNA plasmids and a targeting vector (idpTV, cdpTV or cspTV). The primary sgRNA, shown in dark blue, is designed to bind and target Cas9 to the 5&#x02032; region of the gene of interest, while the secondary sgRNA target site (green) is at the 3&#x02032; end of the cspTV promoter, or between the diametric promoters of the cdpTV and idpTV. After Cas9 cuts the TV, the resulting linearized vector is integrated at the target site in genomic DNA, presumably via NHEJ repair of the double-stranded breaks.

The primary sgRNAs targeting the genome were co-transfected into 293T cells with three plasmids containing (a) an expression cassette for active Cas9, (b) our customized cspTV, cdpTV or idpTV, and (c) a universal secondary sgRNA. Following transfection, cells with integration of the TV were selected using puromycin and, in cells transfected with the idpTV, gene expression was induced with doxycycline. Isolated clones were screened by PCR to verify integration of the idpTV at the locus of interest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). In parallel, one sgRNA or a mixture of 4 sgRNAs (previously validated for use with CRISPRa) was co-transfected into 293Ts with dCas9-VPR for comparison of our system with CRISPRa (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Gene expression using an individual sgRNA directing dCas9-VPR to target promoters was increased &#x0223c;10-fold for all targets tested but the results were not statistically significant. Utilization of four sgRNAs simultaneously activated gene expression more effectively than 1 sgRNA (<italic>ASCL1:</italic> &#x0223c;1800-fold, <italic>NEUROD1:</italic> &#x0223c;2900-fold, <italic>POU5F1:</italic> &#x0223c;90-fold). With NAVIa, the degree of gene activation using the cspTV (<italic>ASCL1:</italic> &#x0223c;730-fold, <italic>NEUROD1:</italic> &#x0223c;600-fold, <italic>POU5F1:</italic> &#x0223c;200-fold) or cdpTV (<italic>ASCL1:</italic> &#x0223c;8500-fold, <italic>NEUROD1:</italic> &#x0223c;3000-fold, <italic>POU5F1:</italic> &#x0223c;1000-fold) was superior to CRISPRa using 1 sgRNA but lower or not statistically different from activation obtained using CRISPRa with 4 sgRNAs for two of the three targets. However, the idpTV (<italic>ASCL1:</italic> &#x0223c;7200-fold, <italic>NEUROD1:</italic> &#x0223c;76000-fold, <italic>POU5F1:</italic> &#x0223c;5370-fold) surpassed activation obtained using dCas9-VPR using four sgRNAs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Interestingly, the improvement of NAVIa over dCas9-VPR was higher for targets branded as difficult to regulate with CRISPRa (<italic>POU5F1:</italic> &#x0223c;60-fold improvement, <italic>NEUROD1:</italic> &#x0223c;26-fold improvement) than for a target considered easy to activate (<italic>ASCL1:</italic> &#x0223c;4-fold improvement).</p><p>When using CRISPRa it is difficult to predict optimal sgRNA target sites for efficient gene activation. While it is generally accepted that proximity to the TSS of the target gene is important, other parameters such as presence of enhancers or local chromatin structure are also critical and, perhaps, more difficult to predict (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;25</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). We investigated a potential correlation between gene activation using NAVIa and distance between integration site and TSS by measuring gene expression induced with sgRNAs that target DNA sequences between positions &#x02013;1010 and +1995, relative to the TSS of three different genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Plotting these data for all three genes showed that NAVIa can activate gene expression efficiently from any integration site on this range, with the most activity being derived from sgRNAs between &#x02013;500 and +200 bp relative to the TSS.</p><p>Since maximal gene activation may not be desirable in all experimental settings, CRISPRa has been adapted for tunable gene expression through combinatorial delivery of multiple sgRNAs (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;16</xref>). However, such efforts to modulate gene expression have proven unpredictable. Alternatively, NAVIa enables facile integration of any TV, which can facilitate gene activation by a wide variety of regulatory mechanisms provided by existing artificial promoters. As the idpTV used in these experiments introduces a doxycycline-inducible promoter, we anticipated a precise temporal control of gene expression that could be tuned by the concentration of doxycycline in the growth medium. Induction of gene expression for 96 h with concentrations of doxycycline ranging from 2 ng/ml to 2 &#x003bc;g/ml led to a dose-dependent increase in gene expression ranging between &#x0223c;337-fold and &#x0223c;26&#x000a0;015-fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Considering this result, we chose to use 200 ng/ml doxycycline for a time course that demonstrated that induction of <italic>NEUROD1</italic> is detectable 12 h after treatment (&#x0223c;4000-fold) and continues to increase at 24 h (&#x0223c;5000-fold), 48 h (&#x0223c;10&#x000a0;000-fold) and 96 h (&#x0223c;15&#x000a0;000-fold) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). Western blots of a clonal population of 293Ts with heterozygous idpTV integration at the <italic>NEUROD1</italic> locus confirmed an increase in <italic>NEUROD1</italic> protein expression levels in the induced samples compared to the WT controls and uninduced samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). Furthermore, upon removal of doxycycline, the RNA expression of <italic>NEUROD1</italic> returns to near basal levels within 96 hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>).</p><p>Tetracycline-inducible systems have been designed for high responsiveness to doxycycline, yet background expression in the absence of inducer, while low, continues to be a problem that hinders applications requiring precise control over gene activation (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). While inducibility is a significant advantage of NAVIa over CRISPRa, tetracycline-inducible promoters are typically used to modulate expression cassettes within a vector and not in a genomic context where the surrounding transcriptional regulatory elements may contribute to undesired expression at steady state. Analysis of <italic>NEUROD1</italic> activation within samples not induced with doxycycline revealed significant background expression (&#x0223c;432-fold over basal expression, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). While we failed to identify a correlation between background and distance from the integration to ATG codons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>) or between background expression and basal expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>), we reasoned that expression of rtTA from unintegrated plasmids still transiently present from the transfection might be partly responsible for high background levels of expression. Indeed, background expression in clones with heterozygous or homozygous integrations was significantly lower than in pooled populations, while gene induction in heterozygous clones was similar to that observed in pooled populations but significantly lower than activation in homozygous clones. The ratio of gene expression between samples with and without doxycycline treatment was improved from &#x0223c;22-fold induction in pooled cells to &#x0223c;126-fold and &#x0223c;1486-fold in heterozygous and homozygous clones respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The levels of activation observed in heterozygous clones, homozygous clones, and pooled populations were similar in the presence of doxycycline, which indicates that the high levels of expression seen in the pooled population are unlikely due to a minority of cells expressing large amounts of transcript.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Multiplexed Gene Activation Using NAVIa.

Data in A, B, C and D are shown as the mean &#x000b1; S.E.M.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkz210fig2"/></fig><p>One important feature of CRISPRa architectures is multiplexability. Different genes can be activated simultaneously by delivering sgRNAs targeting each promoter (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Two benefits of NAVI over other integration platforms, such as those utilizing HR, are the universal adaptability of the system to target different genomic loci by simply providing additional primary sgRNAs and the facile clone screening and isolation upon selection. Since activation of different genes using NAVIa can be accomplished using a set of vectors in which the only variable element is the primary sgRNA, this flexible architecture is also compatible with multiplexing. To demonstrate these capabilities, we first identified sgRNAs for targeting additional genes with NAVIa including <italic>IL1B, IL1R2, LIN28A</italic> and <italic>ZFP42</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). To facilitate multiplexing, we utilized a custom Golden Gate cloning plasmid to prepare two multi-sgRNA (mgRNA) vectors capable of delivering a total of seven individual sgRNAs targeting genes and one sgRNA for linearizing the idpTV, each under independent promoter control (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Co-transfection of these plasmids alongside the idpTV and Cas9 vectors into 293T cells was followed by induction of gene expression with doxycycline for two days. Analysis of mRNA expression across all targeted genes demonstrates that multiplexed gene activation with NAVIa surpasses CRISPRa for all targets tested (ranging from &#x0223c;15-fold to &#x0223c;400-fold) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Together, these results emphasize the multiplexing capabilities of NAVIa, as well as a clear advantage over CRISPRa when only one sgRNA is employed.</p><p>To further validate the trends we observed in 293T cells, we targeted <italic>NEUROD1</italic> using our cdpTV in other cell lines. NAVIa effectively activated expression of <italic>NEUROD1</italic> in the human colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT116, the primary human fibroblast cell line MRC-5, and the mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro-2A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we chose <italic>TERT</italic> as a target to demonstrate the applicability of NAVIa for activating genes that are difficult to regulate with CRISPRa (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) in a primary cell line that is difficult to transfect as well as to demonstrate a physiological effect. Following transfection and selection of SF7996 cells (primary glioblastoma cells, which depend on <italic>TERT</italic> for survival and proliferation (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>)), we derived a clonal population in which expression of <italic>TERT</italic> is controlled by the idpTV and can be induced in a dose-dependent manner with doxycycline. It is noteworthy that following idpTV integration, <italic>TERT</italic> expression could no longer be detected without induction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), but the addition of doxycycline upregulated gene expression and enabled &#x0223c;40-fold activation over control untreated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Since SF7996 cells depend on <italic>TERT</italic> expression for survival over multiple cell divisions, they were maintained in regular growth media supplemented with doxycycline. When the growth media was switched to tetracycline-free medium, the proliferation rate decreased relative to that of the doxycycline-induced cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), demonstrating a method to immortalize cell lines by regulating expression of native <italic>TERT</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="SEC4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this manuscript we describe a novel platform to activate native gene expression based on integration of heterologous promoters, which provides some advantages over CRISPRa. For example, NAVIa enables robust activation across target genes following a single transfection and with minimal cloning and facile isolation of isogenic cell lines expressing the selected gene. Furthermore, NAVIa can be adapted for gene regulation using any constitutive or inducible promoters of interest and achieves consistent activation from a wide range of positions near the TSS, which minimizes the screening needed to identify optimal sgRNAs.</p><p>Promoter integration is accomplished by NAVI (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), which utilizes NHEJ, which provides significant advantages over DNA integration platforms that rely on Homologous Recombination (HR). For example, NHEJ is more effective than HR in non-dividing cells and has been exploited to integrate therapeutic transgenes in post-mitotic cells (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Although NAVI is subject to some shortcomings associated with its specific gene editing mechanism, such as the error-prone nature of NHEJ and chromosomal translocations (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), we have observed only minor indels at target sites both here (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>) and in previous studies (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). In a recent study, Niu <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) identified chromosomal abnormalities in cell lines that had been modified via multiplexed DSBs, however they concluded that chromosomally normal clones could be obtained through genomic screening. While this is a risk inherent to any editing strategy that relies on DSBs, ATFs are not necessarily safer in this regard as permanent regulation of gene expression through ATFs can only be obtained through stable integration using viral vectors, gene editing, or transposases, which entail similar risks to NAVIa. Another potential problem resulting from integration via NHEJ is that it is also possible to have multiple copies of the transfer vector integrated at the site of the genomic DSB, however these events can be easily screened for by PCR. It should be noted that we were unable to detect any instances of multiple integrations in a pooled population of 293T cells containing idpTV integrations at the <italic>NEUROD1</italic> locus, as well as three clonal populations. Furthermore, the dual promoter architecture ensures that there is always a synthetic promoter activating gene expression should multiple linearized transfer vectors be integrated.</p><p>In the majority of the experiments shown in this manuscript we demonstrate very high, supraphysiological levels of gene activation, which may not be necessary and/or relevant in all experimental settings. However, it is important to note that these high levels of expression can be modulated by controlling the dose of inducer to achieve any desired outcome. We have observed that in the absence of an inducer the levels of expression of the target genes increased over background due to the inherent leakiness of the inducible promoter used in this particular study. However, since this gene activation system is universal, we anticipate that any other tightly-controlled promoter can be used to minimize this potential problem. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that the levels of background expression can be decreased by controlling the number of modified alleles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Despite the drastic increase in rates of <italic>NEUROD1</italic> transcription, only &#x0223c;2-fold increase was observed at the protein level, indicating that rates of translation remain a bottleneck in overexpression studies. Additionally, while we achieved very high levels of expression in model cell lines, such as 293Ts, activation in primary cells, in which native gene expression is more difficult to regulate, more closely resembled physiological conditions. Importantly, in experiments involving primary cells and/or genes that are tightly regulated, such as <italic>TERT</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>,&#x000a0;D), CRISPRa is often ineffective (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>Conceptually, gene activation by NAVIa resembles transgene expression from a heterologous promoter. However, NAVIa provides some advantages over these systems. For instance, expression of large transgenes is challenging using viral vectors such as AAV or lentiviruses, however, NAVIa can be easily applied for activation of any gene. Additionally, lentiviral systems rely on random integration of transgenes, which often results in different copy number across cells leading to variable and unpredictable levels of expression, which are difficult to control precisely. Another disadvantage of transgenes is that they cannot recapitulate the various protein isoforms that are expressed from a given mammalian gene. NAVIa is expected to maintain natural splicing patterns, as we have previously observed that the overall patterns of gene expression and splicing patterns are maintained despite target gene activation of several orders of magnitude (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Additionally, NAVIa allows multiple genes to be upregulated simultaneously by using additional sgRNAs while delivery of multiple heterologous genes using viral vectors can be challenging.</p><p>One important concern about the NAVIa system is that it is prone to Cas9 off-target nuclease activity (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Such activity may lead to off-target vector integration and the inadvertent upregulation of additional genes. It should be noted that we did not detect off-target integrations in any of the clones that we screened (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Tables S6 and S7</xref>). Furthermore, the risk of off-target integration can be mitigated by using truncated sgRNAs (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) or enhanced versions of Cas9 that have increased specificity (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). While CRISPRa is also susceptible to off-target activation (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), one fundamental difference between both systems is that, for sustained gene activation, CRISPRa necessitates the stable expression, or repeated introduction, of heterologous system components, which may have obvious negative implications on their own. In contrast, NAVIa only necessitates transient nuclease activity to integrate a single synthetic element and is easily amenable to customization to reduce or completely eliminate off-target effects. Additionally, NAVIa can easily be adapted for reversible activation by adding LoxP sites to the integration vector, which would allow for removal of the promoter system using Cre recombinase. While this strategy could be used to remove the synthetic promoter, it should be noted that Cre-Lox recombination leaves a genomic scar that may affect expression levels. Furthermore, this technique should be avoided if a multiplexed approach is being used, as the presence of multiple LoxP sites within the genome may result in chromosomal rearrangements or other aberrations.</p><p>One significant advantage of NAVIa over existing CRISPRa methods is the rapid and facile generation and screening of stable cell lines with tunable or programmable properties and a highly predictable pattern of integration. Inducible CRISPRa methods have been developed by integrating a tetracycline-inducible Cas9-based transcriptional activator at random genomic loci (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Induction of target gene expression with these systems requires persistent expression of the sgRNA while expression of the ATF, and ultimately target gene activation, is controlled by treatment with doxycycline. Although these systems are tunable, they also exhibit significant background expression in the absence of doxycycline (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In contrast, NAVIa replaces native promoters via targeted integration of a tetracycline-inducible promoter to achieve a rapid response to the inducer while avoiding unpredictable lentiviral integration patterns.</p><p>Another potential limitation of NAVIa in these experiments was the integration of two promoters in different orientations. While this approach ensures that one promoter is always positioned in the correct orientation for overexpression of the target gene, it is possible that the other promoter can modify expression in the opposite orientation. While this shortcoming also occurs with bidirectional gene activation induced by CRISPRa, it can be overcome by simply using a TV with a single promoter and isolating clones with only integrations in the desired orientation. Though this alternative strategy requires screening, it effectively prevents potential aberrant activation at the opposite end of the vector. In general, for experiments simply focused on activating the gene of interest and where a stable cell line is not required, the use of the bidirectional promoter will ensure that upregulation of the gene of interest is achieved in most cells within a pooled population. However, for creation of stable cell lines it might be desirable to use the single promoter, which ensures that neighboring genes will not be affected.</p><p>In summary, the robust levels of activation, multiplexing capabilities, and adaptability make NAVIa an attractive new platform for a variety of synthetic biology applications including metabolic engineering, drug screening, and signal transduction pathway analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>gkz210_Supplemental_File</label><media xlink:href="gkz210_supplemental_file.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ACK1"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Charles Gersbach for providing the Golden Gate plasmids for cloning sgRNAs.
