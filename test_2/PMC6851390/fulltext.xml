However, a systematic comparison of the binding specificities of anti-MUC1 antibodies was not previously conducted. Here, a total of 20 glycopeptides including the tandem repeat unit of MUC1, APPAHGVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAPPAHGV with GalNAc (Tn-antigen), Gal&#x003b2;1-3GalNAc (T-antigen), NeuAc&#x003b1;2-3Gal&#x003b2;1-3GalNAc (sialyl-T-antigen), or NeuAc&#x003b1;2-6GalNAc (sialyl-Tn-antigen) at each threonine or serine residue were prepared by a combination of chemical glycopeptide synthesis and enzymatic extension of carbohydrate chains. These glycopeptides were tested by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for their capacity to bind 13 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) known to be specific for MUC1. The results indicated that anti-MUC1 mAbs have diverse specificities but can be classified into a few characteristic groups based on their binding pattern toward glycopeptides in some cases having a specific glycan at unique glycosylation sites. Because the clinical significance of some of these antibodies was already established, the structural features identified by these antibodies as revealed in the present study should provide useful information relevant to their further clinical use and the biological understanding of MUC1.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Drug development</kwd><kwd>Drug development</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP19ae0101027</award-id><award-id>JP19ae0101026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chiba</surname><given-names>Yasunori</given-names></name><name><surname>Irimura</surname><given-names>Tatsuro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>MEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI numbers 21390018, 25293011, 26670023</award-id><award-id>Core to Core program entitled International Core Research Center for Phototheranostics.</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Irimura</surname><given-names>Tatsuro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Mucin 1 (MUC1) was discovered as a carcinoma-associated mucin-like glycoprotein antigen and a mucin representing the major high-molecular-weight and peanut agglutinin-reactive glycoprotein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. It has hallmarks of membrane-associated mucins, such as an extracellular domain with threonine-rich and serine-rich tandem repeats of 20 amino acids (APPAHGVTSAPDTRPAPGST), a self-catalytic neck domain, a transmembrane domain, and an interaction-prone cytoplasmic tail with many tyrosine residues. MUC1 is ubiquitous among all epithelia and is apparently released into stromal tissue and circulation under disease conditions, whereas it covers the luminal sides of normal epithelia. It is believed that the attachment density and the structure of <italic>O</italic>-glycans of MUC1 expressed by carcinoma cells are distinct from those of normal epithelia-associated MUC1. By this and by many other reasons, MUC1 is considered as the prime target of specific cancer immunotherapy and various forms of vaccines were designed and tested clinically and pre-clinically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Many monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for MUC1 were developed and some of them resulted from immunisation with carcinoma cells and screening for the binding to carcinoma cells. After the gene for the MUC1 core polypeptide was identified and purified, recombinant or synthetic glycopeptides were often used for immunisations and antibody screenings. Some of anti-MUC1 mAbs, for instance 115D8, are marketed world-wide and have been used as a standard clinical tool to monitor tumour burden in breast cancer for nearly 30 years (CA15-3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, even though the precise epitope structure in the MUC1 detected by the antibody remains unknown. Another mAb, KL-6, has been used as a serum marker for interstitial pneumonia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Increasing evidence supports a notion that reactivity of many anti-MUC1 mAbs depends on MUC1 glycosylation to varying extents. Karsten and co-workers prepared synthetic glycopeptides with attached Tn antigen (GalNAc) or T (also sometimes called as TF) antigen (Gal&#x003b2;1-3GalNAc) and used them to compare the specificity of anti-MUC1 mAbs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. They found that many anti-MUC1 mAbs recognise the peptide sequence around APDTR, and interestingly many of the antibodies showed higher affinity to the glycopeptide having Tn or T epitopes on its threonine residue than to its unglycosylated counterparts. The length of polypeptide representing the number of tandem repeats also strongly contributes to the binding of some anti-MUC1 antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Other studies with synthetic glycopeptides by Tarp and co-workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, Ohyabu and co-workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and Rangappa and co-workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> revealed glycan structures required for the recognition by a limited number of anti-MUC1 antibodies but did not reach a systematic understanding and classification of these antibodies. Zhou and co-workers attempted to classify anti-MUC1 mAbs based on the nature of their epitopes mostly based on previously published observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In the present report, we have used a systematic approach to extend and deepen such classification. We prepared a series of 20 glycopeptides, each having one of four different carbohydrate chains, Tn-, T-, sialyl-T (ST)-, and sialyl-Tn (STn)-antigen, at one of five possible <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation sites on a 27-mer peptide including the tandem repeat unit of MUC1. T-, ST-, and STn-MUC1 glycopeptides were synthesised from Tn-MUC1 glycopeptides in preparative scale by utilising three glycosyltransferases expressed by a methylotrophic yeast, <italic>Ogataea minuta</italic>. The glycopeptides were tested for their binding to 13 anti-MUC1 mAbs. Using this approach, we were able to classify these antibodies according to their specificity for carbohydrate-protein complexes including the attachment positions. The results could be useful to interpret the differential characteristics of anti-MUC1 mAbs currently in use as diagnostic or therapeutic tools.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation of glycopeptides with a single <italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue attached to Thr or Ser residue of the tandem repeat structure of MUC1</title><p id="Par6">We prepared glycopeptides containing GalNAc residues attached to one of three Thr or two Ser residues of a 27-mer peptide APPAHGVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAPPAHGV including the 20-mer tandem repeat unit of MUC1.

To investigate substrate preference, diluted dC1GalT was used at small-scale reaction. After three-hour incubation, dC1GalT converted more than 40% of the GalNAc glycopeptides into galactosylated products in three of five substrates. The conversion rate after 18&#x02009;hours was found to be in the following order: MUC1 Tn-Thr<sub>8</sub> (87%) &#x02252; MUC1 Tn-Thr<sub>13</sub> (85%)&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;MUC1 Tn-Ser<sub>19</sub> (71%)&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;MUC1 Tn-Thr<sub>20</sub> (46%) &#x0226b; MUC1 Tn-Ser<sub>9</sub> (8%) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In all substrates, from six to 18&#x02009;hours after starting the reaction, product conversion became slow since dC1GalT lost almost half of its activity during the incubation at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (data not shown).

To assess the effects of amino acid side chains, we also tested ST6GalNAc1 with two modified glycopeptides in which Ser-GalNAc residue was substituted by Thr-GalNAc (MUC1 Tn-Ser<sub>9</sub>&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;Thr<sub>9</sub> and MUC1 Tn-Ser<sub>19</sub>&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;Thr<sub>19</sub>). ST6GalNAc1 acted on both Thr-substituted substrates and produced STn-glycopeptides with over 50% yield after incubation for 18&#x02009;hours (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). These results were consistent with a previous report by Blixt and co-workers showing that the chicken ST6GalNAc1 showed a lower activity to GalNAc-Ser residue compared to GalNAc-Thr<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. To prepare STn at Ser<sub>19</sub>, we used MUC1 T-Ser<sub>9</sub> and MUC1 T-Ser<sub>19</sub> as the substrate of ST6GalNAc1, because mouse ST6GalNAc1 was previously reported to prefer T-antigen to Tn-antigen structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.

In the case of MUC1 T-Ser<sub>19</sub>, the product was observed only after 18&#x02009;hours reaction, and the conversion rate was 5%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Preparative-scale synthesis of MUC1 glycopeptides bearing T-, ST- or STn structure</title><p id="Par11">To prepare various glycopeptides to be used in the antibody binding assays, preparative-scale reactions (more than 50 &#x003bc;g of each product) with the three glycosyltransferases used in the small-scale experiments were also performed. The structures of the products were confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization - time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). In the preparation of five T-antigen glycopeptides, recombinant dC1GalT was added to more than 600 &#x003bc;U/reaction.

Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficients between the binding patterns of MY.1E12, 115D8 and Ma695 also revealed a very strong positive correlation (Pearson&#x02019;s r&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.97), supporting the similarities in binding specificities of these mAbs (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9</xref>). 5E5 bound a glycopeptide with Tn attached to Thr<sub>20</sub> and weakly to that with STn attached to Thr<sub>20</sub> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Therefore, we classified these mAbs into one group because they were specific for epitopes formed by combinations of a carbohydrate chain and the peptide sequence or the attachment site. Such specificity toward the unique glycan structure and the attachment site has not previously been shown, except that it was previously suggested for MY.1E12 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>). Antibodies in the second group, SM3 and VU11E2, strongly bound to glycopeptides with an attached carbohydrate chain at Thr<sub>13</sub>, regardless of the structure (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). Antibodies in the third group, VU4H5 and C595, were reactive with almost all glycopeptides, though their reactivity was low or virtually none when a carbohydrate chain is attached at Thr<sub>13</sub> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Antibodies in the fourth group, E29, HMFG2, and HMPV, bound to all glycopeptides and the naked peptide regardless of the attachment of carbohydrate chains (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). The specificities of the antibodies in the fifth group, DF3 and HMFG1, did not follow any observable pattern (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>) as far as their reactivity with these 20 glycopeptides and the naked peptide was compared. Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficients between binding patterns of the mAbs also revealed strong to moderate positive correlations (Pearson&#x02019;s r&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.44&#x02013;0.97) within the second, the third and the fifth group, supporting the similarities in binding specificities of the mAbs within these groups (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Binding patterns of 13 anti-MUC1 mAbs to a panel of 20 glycopeptides and a naked peptide as investigated by ELISA.

The results revealed novel details on the substrate specificity of dC1GalT and ST6GalNAc1, which were used in the glycopeptide synthesis to extend the carbohydrate chains beyond GalNAc. We used these 20 glycopeptides to investigate the binding specificities of 13 anti-MUC1 mAbs. Some of the antibody specificities were previously unknown. This is the first report to show clearly that specificities of anti-MUC1 mAbs are diverse, and that they can be classified into at least five distinct groups. Validity of the grouping was revealed by the Pearson&#x02019;s correlation analysis.</p><p id="Par16">Although it is widely known that polypeptide GalNAc-transferases (ppGalNAc-Ts), an enzyme family catalysing the initial steps in mucin-type glycan synthesis, have different substrate specificities depending on the positions of Ser/Thr residues in glycopeptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, the substrate preference of glycosyltransferases involved in the subsequent extension of <italic>O</italic>-glycans is poorly investigated. In the course of the present study, we found that dC1GalT and ST6GalNAc1 showed variable activity according to the position of the GalNAc residue in the peptide sequence and to the side residue of the amino acid (<italic>i.e</italic>. Ser or Thr) within the MUC1 sequence. This difference may be at least in part due to conformational changes of the peptide backbone after GalNAc incorporation as observed with Thr<sub>13</sub> of MUC1 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>). We found that sialic acid was not efficiently transferred by ST6GalNAc1 directly to GalNAc residues attached to Ser<sub>9</sub> or Ser<sub>19</sub> of the MUC1 glycopeptide used in the present study. This information was essential to designing optimal conditions for the large-scale preparation of all necessary glycopeptides. From our results, it is clear that the structural extension of <italic>O</italic>-glycans is not a random but rather a highly regulated process whose efficiency is decided by the position and the type of amino acid even in the abundant presence of glycosyltransferases. MUC1 is expressed by almost all epithelia, by carcinomas, and (at low levels) by other types of cells, and the extent and the profile of glycosylation is likely to be unique to the particular type of cell. Understanding the patterns of extension of MUC1 glycoforms at a particular target site will be an important and challenging issue in optimizing the specific, goal-oriented use of various anti-MUC1 mAbs.</p><p id="Par17">According to our results, specificities of anti-MUC1 mAbs can be classified into five groups and the grouping was statistically supported by the Pearson&#x02019;s correlation analysis. The epitopes for mAbs in the first group should be formed by a combination of a carbohydrate chain and peptide sequences. The importance of ST structure attached to Thr<sub>8</sub> for MY.1E12 was previously suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, but this was clearly demonstrated by the present investigations. Also, from the results of the present study it became clear that the specificities of 115D8, Ma695, and MY.1E12 are very similar. The epitope for 5E5 is also formed by a combination of Tn attached to Thr<sub>20</sub> and weakly cross-reactive with STn attached to Thr<sub>20</sub>. The preference of 5E5 binding to MUC1 with Tn and STn attached to Thr<sub>20</sub> was not previously known<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Because of the nature of the epitope, we classify 5E5 together with MY.1E12, 115D8 and Ma695 into one group.</p><p id="Par18">Antibodies in the second group, SM3 and VU11E2, are considered to be specific for an epitope formed by the peptide and its accessibility seems to be enhanced by glycosylation of Thr<sub>13</sub> present in the PDTR epitope. In support of our results, it was previously shown that GalNAc introduction at the Thr in the PDTRP motif of synthetic MUC1 peptides increases the binding affinities of SM3 and VU11E2 by a mechanism that stabilizes the conformation of the binding epitope without altering the peptide contact sites, though the contribution of some GalNAc residues to the binding was suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par19">Antibodies in the third group, VU4H5 and C595 are reactive with almost all glycopeptides but the reactivity is low or virtually none when a carbohydrate chain is present at Thr<sub>13</sub>. Therefore, they recognise a similar epitope to that of antibodies in the second group but the accessibility is reduced when Thr<sub>13</sub> is glycosylated. In fact, the peptide epitopes of VU4H5 (APDTR) and VU11E2 (TSAPDTR) have been shown to be very similar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, but our data show that the absence or presence of a glycan on Thr<sub>13</sub> differentially affects their bindings. The difference in immunogens used for the preparation of VU4H5 (a MUC1 60-mer peptide conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA)) and VU11E2 (ZR75-1 breast cancer cells)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> may have influenced their epitope.</p><p id="Par20">Antibodies in the fourth group, E29, HMFG2 and HMPV, bind to glycopeptides and naked peptide regardless of the attachment of carbohydrate chains indicating that the epitope is a peptide and the binding is not affected by the glycosylation of any Thr or Ser when a single glycan is attached.</p><p id="Par21">This classification will be useful to distinguish differentially glycosylated MUC1 biologically relevant to health and disease, such as MUC1 expressed by breast cancer tissue and normal ductal epithelia, and to correlate the differential bindings to the expression profiles of glycosyltransferases. As an example, Thr<sub>13</sub> is known to be glycosylated by ppGalNAc-T4 (refs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>) and possibly other specific ppGalNAc-Ts. Therefore, formation of the epitope reactive with anti-MUC1 antibodies in group 2 and 3 should also be dependent on the expression of this unique group of ppGalNAc-Ts. On the other hand, GalNAc attachment to Thr<sub>8</sub> seems to be catalyzed by various ppGalNAc-Ts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, but the glycan extension to form ST at this particular site may require specific glycosyltransferases. Studies considering the relationship between anti-MUC1 antibody binding and the expression of glycosyltransferases will open a new perspective on the use of various anti-MUC1 mAbs in the near future.</p><p id="Par22">Although studies with synthetic glycopeptides representing portions of MUC1 tandem repeats were conducted previously, systematic understandings were not previously reached. For example, 5E5 was shown to have high specificity to Tn-MUC1 and STn-MUC1 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>), but the present result is the first to show that the attachment site should be Thr<sub>20</sub>. The difficulty in preparing <italic>O</italic>-linked glycopeptides with the full spectrum of structural variations might have previously hindered clear understanding of the antibody specificity, which was overcome in the present study. Thus, a previous attempt by Zhou and co-workers to classify anti-MUC1 mAbs based on the nature of their epitope was not complete because they did not consider which Thr/Ser residue was glycosylated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">The findings of the present study have direct implications for the development of improved MUC1-based tools for the diagnosis and therapy of breast and other types of cancer, considering that a mAb explored in the present study, 115D8, is widely used to detect serum biomarker CA15-3, and that 5E5, SM3 and HMFG2 are used to develop chimeric antigen receptor T-cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.
