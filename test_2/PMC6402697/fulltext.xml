We present a novel machine learning formalism for improved signature inference, based on multi-modal correlated topic models (MMCTM) which can at once infer signatures from both single nucleotide and structural variation counts derived from cancer genome sequencing data. We exemplify the utility of our approach on two hormone driven, DNA repair deficient cancers: breast and ovary (n = 755 samples total). We show how introducing correlated structure both within and between modes of mutation can increase accuracy of signature discovery, particularly in the context of sparse data. Our study emphasizes the importance of integrating multiple mutation modes for signature discovery and patient stratification, and provides a statistical modeling framework to incorporate additional features of interest for future studies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Over time DNA accumulates mutations from a variety of sources. Some mutations result from external mutagens, such as UV radiation, while others result from processes occurring within the cell itself. Each of these sources can impart characteristic patterns of mutations on the genome, known as mutation signatures, which can be detected using computational techniques. Loss of DNA repair mechanisms can leave specific mutation signatures in the genomes of cancer cells. To identify cancers with broken DNA-repair processes, accurate methods are needed for detecting mutation signatures and, in particular, their activities or probabilities within individual cancers. In this paper, we introduce a class of statistical modeling methods used for natural language processing, known as &#x0201c;topic models&#x0201d;, that outperform standard methods for signature analysis. We show that topic models that incorporate signature probability correlations across cancers perform best, while jointly analyzing multiple mutation types improves robustness to low mutation counts.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>We wish to acknowledge the generous long-term funding support from BC Cancer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bccancer.bc.ca">www.bccancer.bc.ca</ext-link>).

Many mutational processes leave distinct genomic &#x0201c;footprints&#x0201d;, measurable via nucleotide substitution patterns [<xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], localised mutation densities, and patterns of structural variation (SV). As such, each mutagenic source (whether exogenous or endogenous) changes DNA in a characteristic manner, at genomic locations with preferred chemical and structural characteristics. Exogenous insults such as ultra-violet radiation and tobacco smoke-associated mutagens (<italic>e.g</italic>. benzo[a]pyrene) induce single nucleotide variants (SNVs) with characteristic C&#x02192;T (at CC or TC dinucleotides) [<xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and C&#x02192;A mutation patterns [<xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], respectively; endogenous APOBEC activity mediates enzymatic 5-methylcytosine deamination, resulting in C&#x02192;T substitution patterns at TC dinucleotides [<xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Cancer cells can also acquire endogenous mutator phenotypes, accumulating mutations [<xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] due to DNA repair deficiencies. Defective DNA repair processes induce both point mutations and structural variations [<xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and include several mechanistic classes such as mismatch repair deficiency (MMRD), homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), microhomology mediated end-joining, and breakage fusion bridge processes. Defective DNA repair has been exploited in therapeutic regimes, including immune checkpoint blockade for mismatch repair deficiency [<xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and synthetic lethal approaches for HRD [<xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], underscoring their clinical importance.</p><p>Both point mutation signatures [<xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and structural variation signatures [<xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have been studied extensively as independent features of cancer genomes, mostly through non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) approaches [<xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As increasing numbers of whole genomes are generated from tumors in international consortia and focused investigator research, the need for robust signature inference methods is acute. Additional computational methods have been proposed [<xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], however no approaches jointly infer signatures from <italic>both</italic> point mutation and structural variations. We contend that systematic, integrative analysis of point mutation and structural variation processes enhances ability to exploit signatures for subgroup discovery, prognostic and therapeutic stratification, clinical prediction, and driver gene association.</p><p>Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [<xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], a popular and effective approach for natural language document analysis, is well suited to the task of mutation signature inference. Although LDA was designed to extract topics from documents, these concepts can be mapped to mutation signatures and somatic mutation catalogues derived from tissue samples, respectively. In this paper we introduce the correlated topic model (CTM) [<xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], an extension of LDA which incorporates signature correlation, and a multi-modal correlated topic model (mf-CTM.dt in Salomatin <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], hereafter referred to as MMCTM). A modality is a particular kind of data, and in this report SNV and SV counts are two distinct modalities. The MMCTM thereby jointly infers signatures from multiple mutation types, such as SNVs and SVs.</p><p>Signature correlations can arise through a mutational process generating multiple signatures, as with the HRD-associated SNV and SV signatures. C&#x02192;T substitutions caused by APOBEC cytidine deaminases have also been shown to cluster around SV breakpoints [<xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Correlations between mechanistically independent signatures can also occur; for example, COSMIC SNV signatures 1 and 5 are both correlated with age of diagnosis in some cancer types [<xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>We set out to investigate whether statistical modeling that could encode correlations between signatures could enhance accuracy in signature analysis. We show how integrating SNV and SV signature probability correlation improves mutation signature inference relative to NMF and standard topic modeling methods. By incorporating statistical correlation and multiple modalities, more information is provided to the model, improving inference further, while still maintaining distinct signatures for each modality.</p><p>Motivated by the need to better understand mutation signatures in the context of DNA repair deficiency, we analysed breast and ovarian tumour genomes. We applied the MMCTM to SNV and SV somatic mutations derived from whole genomes (breast [<xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and ovarian [<xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]; 755 samples total), performing joint statistical inference of signatures. Our results reveal correlated topic models as an important analytic advance over standard approaches. Rigorous benchmarking over mutation signatures inferred from previously published mutation corpora was used to establish metrics for comparison. We show systematically how correlation integration improves inference, especially in the context of sparse mutation counts, and where SNVs and SVs are considered jointly. In addition, we report novel strata using MMCTM-derived signatures, including patient groups exhibiting combined whole genome SNV and SV signature profiles from breast and ovary cancers. We automatically recovered <italic>BRCA1</italic>-like and <italic>BRCA2</italic>-like homologous recombination repair deficient breast and ovarian cancers, where the tumors bearing the well known SNV HRD signature were reproducibly split on the basis of SVs. In aggregate, our study reveals the importance of simultaneously considering multiple classes of genomic disruption as a route to expanding mutation signature discovery, and their downstream impact on novel stratification across human cancers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Correlated topic models for signature inference</title><p>We developed a suite of probabilistic correlated topic models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006799.g001">Fig 1</xref>) to evaluate their utility in signature discovery.

How the sample-signature distributions are generated differ between LDA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006799.g001">Fig 1a and 1d</xref>) and the correlated topic models. In LDA, this variable is drawn from a Dirichlet distribution [<xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. With the correlated topic models, however, it comes from the transformation of a variable that is distributed according to a multivariate Gaussian distribution [<xref rid="pcbi.1006799.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006799.g001">Fig 1b, 1c and 1d</xref>).

We compared overall-survival amongst the HGSC super-clusters using the Kaplan-Meier method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006799.g006">Fig 6e and 6f</xref>). The <italic>BRCA2</italic>/deletion cluster had the highest survival rate, while the <italic>CDK12</italic>/tandem duplicator group had the worst.

Our findings have several implications for the field. The use of structural variations in signature analysis is less common than for point mutations, in part due to the relative paucity of whole-genome sequencing datasets. Here, we show the significant new value from their joint interpretation, and set the framework for their simultaneous consideration across a broad range of tumour types. Moreover, our results demonstrate that correlated statistical modeling improves signature inference in the context of sparse mutation counts. The HRD point mutational signature is well described, but automated association of tandem duplications within <italic>BRCA1</italic>-like and interstitial deletions within <italic>BRCA2</italic>-like cancers represents an important refinement, reproduced here in two independent cancer types, with data from two independent studies. Furthermore, we show in the ovarian cancer cohort how this has prognostic implication, superseding what could be derived from gene-based biomarkers (i.e. if only <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutation status were considered).</p><p>We have introduced a new formalism for mutation signature analysis in cancer genomes. Our approach models the correlation between signatures, which provides their performance increase. However, when no correlations exist between signature probabilities, this method will likely not provide much benefit. In these situations, a researcher may opt to use an alternative, such as NMF or LDA. Nevertheless, signature correlations exist in at least breast and ovarian cancer, as shown in this report, and we believe analysis of other cancer types will benefit from our approach.</p><p>The topic models discussed in this manuscript produce signature probabilities, as opposed to activity estimates, which requires a subtle difference in interpretation. Signature probabilities are related to activities, but they indicate the probability of signatures generating a mutation, rather than the proportion of mutations generated by a signature. The topic models discussed output non-zero signature probabilities for each sample, due to their Bayesian formulation. Since every sample is unlikely to have experienced activity from every detected signature, one may wish to set a probability threshold to determine active signatures for downstream analysis. However, the optimal choice of probability threshold is a matter for future investigation.</p><p>Correlated topic models are significantly more robust to reduced mutation burden, which can occur in a number of scenarios. We have already described that signature extraction from SVs, at the level detected in the breast and ovarian datasets analysed here, benefits from correlated signature modeling. Analysis of other low-count mutation types may also benefit, for example mutations called from exome or single-cell sequencing experiments.</p><p>Importantly, the statistical framework of the MMCTM is flexible and extensible. While here we show the advantage of integrated SNV and SV analysis, the MMCTM can seamlessly integrate other count-based features such as copy number events, double strand breaks, and telomeric insertions. As the field develops, we suggest a robust and extensible framework will be required to encode and integrate multiple feature types of the genome as they relate to mutational processes.</p><p>The advantage of our relatively simple SNV and SV integration is evident and motivates further advances through multi-modal statistical modelling leading to richer biological interpretations of endogenous and potentially exogenous processes. In conclusion, our findings reinforce the importance of an integrated, holistic view of multiple classes of genomic scarring to drive discovery and characterization of mutation processes across human cancers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Mutation data processing</title><p>Nucleotides flanking SNVs were extracted from human reference GRCh37.

The sample-signature distributions were used as training data for the classifier along with previously published HRDetect-derived labels. HRDetect negative cases were subsampled for each method run to produce balanced datasets for training and evaluation, with 124 positive and negative labels each.
