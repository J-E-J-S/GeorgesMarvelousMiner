Systematic efforts to characterize this regulatory layer have revealed that RNA modifications are far more widespread than previously thought, can be subjected to dynamic regulation, and can profoundly impact RNA processing stability and translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. A fundamental challenge in the field, however, is the lack of a generic approach for mapping and quantifying RNA modifications, as well as, the lack of single molecule resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Current technologies to map the epitranscriptome rely on next-generation sequencing and, as such, they are typically blind to nucleotide modifications. Consequently, indirect methods are required to identify RNA modifications transcriptome-wide, which has been mainly approached using two different strategies: (i) antibody immunoprecipitation, which specifically recognizes the modified ribonucleotide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>; and (ii) chemical-based detection, using chemical compounds that selectively react with the modified ribonucleotide of interest, followed by reverse-transcription of the RNA fragment, which leads to accumulation of reads that have the same identical ends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Although these methods have provided highly valuable information, they are limited by the available repertoire of commercial antibodies and the lack of selective chemical reactivities towards a particular RNA modification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, often lack single nucleotide resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> or require complex protocols to achieve it<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, cannot provide quantitative estimates of the stoichiometry of the modification at a given site, and are often unable to identify the underlying RNA molecule that is modified.</p><p id="Par5">To overcome these limitations, third-generation sequencing technologies, such as the platforms provided by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, have been proposed as a new means to detect RNA modifications in native RNA sequences. RNA modifications can be detected using PacBio in the form of kinetic changes of reverse transcriptases, which occur when the enzyme encounters a modified RNA nucleotide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. On the other hand, RNA modifications can be identified in its native RNA context using ONT, by pulling the RNA molecules through the nanopores that are embedded in a membrane. The ONT platform relies on the measurement of disruptions in the current intensity as the RNA or DNA molecule passes through the pore, which can be used to identify the transiting nucleotides. Although ONT direct RNA sequencing is already a reality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, extracting RNA modification information from ONT reads is still an unsolved challenge. RNA modifications are known to cause disruptions in the pore current that can be detected upon comparison of raw current intensities &#x02014; also known as &#x0201c;squiggles&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, current efforts have not yet yielded an efficient and accurate RNA modification detection algorithm, largely due to the challenges in the alignment and re-squiggling of RNA current intensities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">As an alternative strategy, we hypothesized that the current intensity changes caused by the presence of RNA modifications may lead to increased &#x0201c;errors&#x0201d; and decreased qualities from the output of base-calling algorithms that do not model base modifications (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Indeed, here we find that base-calling &#x0201c;errors&#x0201d; can accurately identify <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) RNA modifications in native RNA sequences, and propose a novel algorithm, <italic>EpiNano</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/enovoa/EpiNano">github.com/enovoa/EpiNano</ext-link>), which can be used to identify m<sup>6</sup>A RNA modifications from RNA reads with an overall accuracy of ~90%. Our results provide a proof of concept for the use of base-called features to identify RNA modifications using direct RNA sequencing, and open avenues to explore additional RNA modifications in the future.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Base-calling &#x0201c;errors&#x0201d; can be used as a proxy to identify RNA modifications in direct RNA sequencing reads. <bold>a</bold> Schematic overview of the strategy used in this work to train and test an m<sup>6</sup>A RNA base-calling algorithm. <bold>b</bold> IGV snapshot of one of the four transcripts used in this work.

Therefore, to systematically identify the current intensity changes caused by the presence of a given RNA modification, perturbations of the current intensity signals should be measured and analyzed for each possible 5-mer (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1024).</p><p id="Par8">To this end, we designed a set of synthetic sequences that comprised all possible 5-mers (median occurrence of each 5-mer&#x02009;=&#x02009;10), while minimizing the RNA secondary structure (see the Methods section and Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). We then employed direct RNA sequencing to characterize the differences of in vitro transcribed (IVT) constructs that incorporated either &#x0201c;m<sup>6</sup>A&#x0201d; instead of adenine, or unmodified ribonucleotides (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for sequencing metrics). Comparison of the two data sets revealed that base-called m<sup>6</sup>A-modified reads were significantly enriched in mismatches compared with their unmodified counterparts (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, c</xref>), and that these &#x0201c;errors&#x0201d; were mainly, but not exclusively, located in adenine positions. We observed that, in addition to mismatch frequency, other metrics including per-base quality, insertion frequency, deletion frequency, and current intensity were significantly altered (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Moreover, these &#x0201c;errors&#x0201d; were highly reproducible in independent biological replicates with respect to mismatch frequency, deletion frequency, per-base quality, and current intensity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d&#x02013;g</xref>). By contrast, insertion frequencies were not reproducible across biological replicates (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), suggesting that this feature is likely unrelated to the presence of RNA modifications, and thus was not further considered in downstream analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Base-calling &#x0201c;errors&#x0201d; can accurately predict m<sup>6</sup>A modifications</title><p id="Par9">We then examined whether these observed differences would be sufficient to accurately classify a given site into &#x0201c;modified&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;unmodified&#x0201d;. For this aim, we first focused our analysis on 5-mers that matched the known m<sup>6</sup>A motif RRACH, as these would be the most relevant in which to detect m<sup>6</sup>A modifications. To reveal whether the features from m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RRACH k-mers were distinct from unmodified RRACH k-mers, we compiled the base-called features (base quality, mismatch frequency, and deletion frequency) for each position of the k-mer (&#x02212;2, &#x02212;1, 0, +1, and +2) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), and performed principal component analysis of the features, finding that the two populations (m<sup>6</sup>A-modified and unmodified RRACH k-mers) were largely nonoverlapping (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). As a control, we performed the same analysis in k-mers with identical sequence context, but centered in C, G, or U (instead of A), finding that no differences could be observed between these populations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), suggesting that the observed differences are m<sup>6</sup>A-specific, and not data set-specific.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Base-calling &#x0201c;errors&#x0201d; alone can accurately identify m<sup>6</sup>A RNA modifications. <bold>a</bold> Base-called features (base quality, insertion frequency, and deletion frequency) of m<sup>6</sup>A motif 5-mers, and for each position of the 5-mer, are shown.

We first tested whether each individual feature at position 0 (the modified site) was able to classify a given RRACH k-mer into m<sup>6</sup>A-modified or unmodified.

By contrast, we find that the current mean intensity values and current intensity standard deviation were poor predictors of the modification status of the k-mer (43&#x02013;65% accuracy).

Yet, our understanding of this regulatory layer is restricted to a few RNA modifications, largely due to the lack of a generic methodology to map them in a transcriptome-wide fashion.</p><p id="Par20">The establishment of the ONT platform as a tool to map RNA modifications has great potential to revolutionize our understanding of the epitranscriptome, as in principle, it should be capable of identifying RNA modifications in individual RNA sequences, and with single nucleotide resolution. Such ability would allow us to study the functions of the epitranscriptome in ways that, until now, have not been possible. Unfortunately, currently there is no software available that can predict RNA modifications from direct RNA sequencing reads with sufficient accuracy, limiting the applicability of direct RNA sequencing as a tool to identify RNA modifications. To tackle this limitation, here we provide a novel strategy to identify RNA modifications from base-called features, without the need of squiggling realignments or manipulation of raw current intensity data sets.</p><p id="Par21">Here we report that RNA modifications can be identified in the form of systematic and reproducible base-calling &#x0201c;errors&#x0201d; in direct RNA sequencing data sets. These &#x0201c;errors&#x0201d; can be detected in the form of altered per-base qualities, mismatch frequencies and deletion frequencies at the modified site. We find that the method accurately detects modifications both in vitro (90% accuracy) and in vivo (87% accuracy), with an overall recovery of 32% of known sites. Despite the promising results, it is important to note, however, that the current method presents several limitations as well as ample room for improvement. Firstly, our current algorithm does not predict RNA modifications in individual RNA molecules, but rather employs information from all the reads mapping to a specific site to determine whether a given position is modified or unmodified. Secondly, our algorithm does not distinguish between different types of RNA modifications (e.g., m<sup>1</sup>A vs m<sup>6</sup>A). Future work will be needed to decipher whether different types of RNA modifications can be associated to distinct &#x0201c;error signatures&#x0201d;, which could be potentially used to identify the underlying RNA modification type. Thirdly, although m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RRACH k-mers globally display altered base qualities, mismatch frequencies and deletion frequencies, we should note that the contribution of each feature varies across different k-mers. For example, we find that the presence of m<sup>6</sup>A in GGACA and GGACT k-mers mainly affects the mismatch and deletion frequency, whereas in the case of GGACC, base quality and deletion frequency are the most altered features by the presence of m<sup>6</sup>A modifications (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Future models that include k-mer specific training and testing could potentially improve the accuracy of prediction of modified sites, as well as reduce the number of false positives. In this regard, we expect that by making our m<sup>6</sup>A-modified and unmodified data sets publicly available &#x02014; both base-called fastq and raw fast5 &#x02014; these can be employed by the community to train different machine learning algorithms (e.g., signal-based machine learning, base-caller training, etc.), and thus lead to improved m<sup>6</sup>A RNA modification base-callers for the whole community.</p><p id="Par22">Overall, our results show that base-calling &#x0201c;errors&#x0201d; can be used as an accurate and computationally simple solution to identify m<sup>6</sup>A modifications, which does not require the manipulation of raw current intensities or squiggle alignments. Moreover, we extend our findings to an in vivo system, showing that our algorithm can capture m<sup>6</sup>A-dependent changes that are present in wild-type SK1 yeast strains, while these are not observed in their <italic>ime4</italic>&#x02206; counterparts.

RNA Adapter (RMX) was ligated onto the RNA:DNA hybrid, and the mix was purified using 1X Agencourt RNAClean XP beads, washing with Wash buffer twice. The sample was then eluted in elution buffer and mixed with RNA running buffer (RRB) prior to loading onto a primed R9.4.1 flow cell, and ran on a GridION (MinION for the second replicate) sequencer with MinKNOW acquisition software version v1.14.1 (v.1.15.1 for the second replicate in the curlcake experiment). The sequencing was performed in independent days and machines, with two biological replicates for each &#x0201c;curlcake&#x0201d; experiment condition (nonmodified and m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNA, total of four flow cells). Each biological replicate and condition was sequenced independently in a different flow cell. For the in vivo analysis in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, three biological replicates for each yeast strain (wild type and <italic>ime4&#x02206;</italic>) were sequenced, and each biological condition and replicate was sequenced in an independent flow cell (total of six flow cells).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Base-calling, filtering, and mapping</title><p id="Par28">Reads were locally base-called using Albacore 2.1.7 (ONT). Base-called reads were filtered using NanoFilt, a component from Nanopack with settings &#x0201c;-q 0 -headcrop 5 -tailcrop 3&#x0201d;, and mapped to the 4 synthetic sequences using minimap2 with the settings -ax map-ont. Mapped reads were then converted into mpileup format using Samtools version 1.4.

For comparison, reads were also base-called with Albacore 2.3.4 and Guppy 2.3.1, finding that all base-callers showed increased mismatch frequencies in m<sup>6</sup>A-modified data sets (with the largest increased in A positions) and decreased qualities (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Feature extraction</title><p id="Par29">To extract per-site features (mean per-base quality, mismatch frequency, insertion frequency, and deletion frequency), BAM alignment files were converted to tab delimited format using sam2tsv from jvarkit. For each individual reference site, the mean quality of the aligned bases, the mismatch, insertion, and deletion frequency was computed using in-house scripts (available on github). To extract current intensity information from individual reads, the h5py (version 2.7.0) module in python was used to parse each individual fast5 file. Reference sequences were slided with a window size of 5&#x02009;bp, and mean and standard deviation of current intensities was computed for each sliding window.

Initial training (75% of the sites) and testing (25%) of the SVM was performed with m<sup>6</sup>A-modified and unmodified curlcake reads from one replicate (rep1). Multiple kernels (&#x0201c;linear&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;poly&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;rbf&#x0201d;) were compared, and the best performing kernel was retained. The model was validated on new sequencing runs of IVT m<sup>6</sup>A-modified and unmodified sequences (rep2), which had not been used for initial training or testing of the SVM. The reported accuracy values refer to the predictions on replicate 2. The code to extract the set of features for machine learning from fastq and fast5 reads, the code for building the SVM models, as well as the trained SVM models, are publicly available in github (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/enovoa/EpiNano">github.com/enovoa/EpiNano</ext-link>). We should note that a limitation in utilizing IVT to generate all possible 5-mers is that 5-mers that contain more than one &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; will contain more than one modification in the k-mer, e.g., AGACC will in fact be m<sup>6</sup>AGm<sup>6</sup>ACC, which are unlikely to occur in a biological context. Therefore, 5-mers that contained more than one A have been excluded from the analyses, as well as from the training set. Accuracy of the model has been computed as the sum of correct m<sup>6</sup>A modification predictions &#x02014; correctly predicted m<sup>6</sup>A-modified k-mers (TP) and correctly predicted unmodified k-mers (true negatives, TN) &#x02014; divided by the total number of k-mers tested.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Prediction of m<sup>6</sup>A modified sites in yeast using EpiNano</title><p id="Par31"><italic>EpiNano</italic> was used to extract per-site features (mean per-base quality, mismatch frequency, insertion frequency, and deletion frequency) from the mapped BAM files of the six samples sequenced (WTrep1, WTrep2, WTrep3, ime4&#x02206;rep1, ime4&#x02206;rep2, and ime4&#x02206;rep3). m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RRACH sites with minimum coverage of 5 reads/site were kept and scored using the previously trained SVM model. 5-mers containing more than one &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; in the motif were discarded from downstream analyses, as these k-mers had not been included in the training sets (see above).
