Highly standardized microbial laboratory evolution experiments are ideally suited to approach these questions. For example, prolonged chemostats provide a constant environment in which the growth rate can be set, and the adaptive process of the organism to such environment can be subsequently characterized.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">We performed parallel laboratory evolution of <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> in chemostats varying the quantitative value of the selective pressure by imposing two different growth rates. A mutation in one specific amino acid residue of the global transcriptional regulator of carbon metabolism, CcpA, was selected in all of the evolution experiments performed. We subsequently showed that this mutation confers predictable fitness improvements at other glucose-limited growth rates as well. In silico protein structural analysis of wild type and evolved CcpA, as well as biochemical and phenotypic assays, provided the underpinning molecular mechanisms that resulted in the specific reprogramming favored in constant environments.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">This study provides a comprehensive understanding of a case of microbial evolution and hints at the wide dynamic range that a single fitness-enhancing mutation may display.

Laboratory evolution offers unique opportunities for the testing of predictions made by population geneticists and evolutionary biologists, whilst monitoring evolving populations under controlled, and well-defined, conditions. Microorganisms are appealing to be used for evolutionary studies due to their fast growth rate, controllable population size and the availability of advanced molecular biology tools. Moreover, for many microorganisms detailed knowledge exists about operon organization, transcription regulation and physiology such that detailed molecular understanding of the adaptive processes can be obtained.</p><p id="Par5">Laboratory evolution of microorganisms can be carried out under a broad range of selective pressures, such as varying growth rate in serial batch cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], antibiotic resistance in different cultivation settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], nutrient limitation in chemostats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], cell number in emulsion-based systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and growth rate in dynamic environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Such studies have revealed remarkable evolutionary versatility of microorganisms to adapt to different selective pressures.</p><p id="Par6">In this study, we exploited the chemostat to perform laboratory evolution. The chemostat presents an ideal system to study two basic aspects regarding the versatility of microbial evolution: plasticity and evolvability.</p><p id="Par7">Evolutionary plasticity is related to the existence of alternative mutations that give rise to a comparable fitness enhancement for a particular selective pressure. Plasticity is high when many alternatives exist, and tends to zero when only a single option subsists. In the chemostat, plasticity can be assessed across a wide range of strengths for the same selection pressure. This can be achieved by replicate experiments testing for fixation of alternative mutations at multiple dilution rates.</p><p id="Par8">Evolvability considers the rate of evolution. It is both related to the number of mutations required, and their fixation rate, to reach a specific quantitative change in fitness. If several mutations are required in sequence for a specific quantitative change in fitness then evolvability is low, and vice-versa.</p><p id="Par9">Until now, microbial evolution in chemostats has been limited by the number of replicates and by the number of generations and volume changes. The chemostat was initially described as a device that could continuously cultivate bacteria for an indefinite period of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, to date the longest published cultivation using a chemostat is only a few hundred generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], despite recent advancements in the development of dedicated multiplex culture systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This is several orders of magnitude shorter than the longest serial batch cultivation experiments &#x02013; &#x0003e;&#x02009;50,000 generations and counting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. To address the lack of long-term continuous cultivation, we developed a versatile bioreactor cap and experimental set-up to perform parallel, prolonged cultivations under chemostat conditions, at small working volumes. These advances allowed us to conduct experiments in quadruplicate for more than 1350 consecutive generations.</p><p id="Par10">We studied the microbial evolution of <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> in glucose-limited chemostats. This well-characterized lactic acid bacterium (LAB) exhibits a simple fermentative metabolism and is an ideal model organism to investigate broader evolutionary principles. It carries a small genome (about 2.5&#x02009;Mb) and several strains isolated from different niches have been fully sequenced, allowing for a good understanding of the natural evolution of this bacterium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We describe a laboratory evolution experiment in chemostats at two different dilution rates with 4 replicates each. The mutations were identified and their molecular consequences characterized. We elucidated the fitness enhancement using complementary computational and experimental approaches. Remarkably, we found the same mutation in experimental replicates across the dilution rates tested. We further tested experimentally our in-silico simulations by carrying out chemostat competition experiments at two additional dilution rates, and found that this mutation was also advantageous then.</p><p id="Par11">This study indicates that the fitness landscape of this microbial evolution process is likely single-peaked and insensitive to the strength of the selection pressure. This suggests that the adaptation process from batch cultivation to constant conditions set by glucose limitation is characterized by high evolvability and low plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemostat design and cultivation conditions for long-term microbial evolution under stable environmental conditions</title><p id="Par12">A requirement of laboratory evolution is that the technical variability between replicates should be minimized. Our initial focus was to carefully define the cultivation conditions (chemostat and medium) and to standardize the experimental procedures (inoculation, sampling, and cell storage). We developed a chemically defined medium particularly suited for prolonged cultivation (CDMPC) based on the nutrient requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and biomass composition of <italic>L. lactis</italic> MG1363 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] (detailed in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table&#x000a0;S1). The major differences compared to previously published chemically defined media for <italic>L. lactis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] are (i) the implementation of standardized procedures that reduce variations between media batches, (e.g. those caused by poor solubility of metal co-factors); (ii) the removal of components that cause technical (downstream) difficulties or perturbation of cell behavior; and (iii) the finetuning of the concentration of medium compounds to meet the nutrient requirements of <italic>L. lactis</italic>. To reduce the variability introduced by the inoculation procedure, we implemented a strictly controlled cryopreservation and inoculation procedure described in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Standardized cryopreservation procedure to minimize strain variability among experiments.

Strains can rapidly deviate from their original genotype, which can sometimes lead to noticeable phenotypic differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Our initial inoculum came from the original <italic>L. lactis</italic> MG1363 stock, for which the genome sequence is published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We wanted to ensure that all the prolonged cultivations would be seeded from the same starting inoculum as much as possible, so we implemented a standardized cryopreservation and inoculation procedure (detailed in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In order to ensure standardized growth in the newly developed medium, we performed a short-term serial batch adaptation of an isolate of this strain to the medium CDMPC. The resulting single isolate picked (Genr0) was cryopreserved and used as the seeding population for all the laboratory evolution experiments performed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par14">We aimed at carrying out all the prolonged cultivations under tightly controlled conditions, while the cultures were left as unperturbed as possible, and without interruptions. We needed a chemostat set-up that would be (i) suitable to run parallel cultivations; (ii) robust enough to be stable for several hundreds of generations; and (iii) with a relatively small working volume to limit the amount of medium needed to a manageable amount. Unfortunately, such set-ups are not commercially available such that our list of specifications is met. And although there are some tailored parallel continuous cultivation systems reported in literature (a very good example in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]), we speculated that they would not offer the type of robustness that would be necessary (particularly, due to the tubing connectors used to the in- and outlet ports of the reactor). So to permit more robust parallel cultivations and reduce costs, we designed small-scale bioreactors made of welded aluminum especially suited and tested to meet these requirements (detailed in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Parallel laboratory evolution in chemostat cultures</title><p id="Par15"><italic>L. lactis</italic> MG1363 has a cultivation history that most likely resembles a serial batch with its growth rate varying with changes in nutrient availability. To investigate the evolutionary plasticity of this strain when adapting to constant environments, we allowed it to evolve under chemostat conditions i.e. with a constant growth rate. Genr0 was cultivated continuously in four replicates, each using 60&#x02009;mL glucose-limited chemostats at a growth rate of 0.5&#x02009;h<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;1</sup> without any kind of interruption. The experiment was stopped after 309 volume changes (calculated by multiplying the dilution rate by the cultivation time), which corresponds to 445 generations (determined by multiplying the doubling time (equals Ln2 divided &#x003bc;) by the cultivation time). A growth rate of 0.5&#x02009;h<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;1</sup> is equivalent to ~&#x02009;70% of the maximal growth rate in CDMPC for <italic>L. lactis</italic>. Culture samples were harvested periodically every 15&#x02013;25 generations from the effluent to determine cell density and the fluxes of fermentation substrates and products (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Cell samples were stored as glycerol stocks at &#x02212;&#x02009;80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C to be used as snapshots of the evolutionary process.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Strain characteristics during the evolution experiments at D of 0.5&#x02009;h<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;1</sup> and of the resulting evolved strains.

Mean concentrations at each generation are shown by data symbol &#x02018;X&#x02019;, along with error bars representing standard deviation and a 3rd order polynomial fit solely used for the purpose of visualizing the overall trend</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12862_2018_1331_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par16">Throughout the prolonged cultivation, all four replicates (referred hereon as 445C1 through 445C4, referring to the number of generations) displayed very similar behavior. Biomass concentration did not vary significantly indicating that biomass yield on substrate remained constant (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). <italic>L. lactis</italic> can catabolize glucose through homolactic or mixed acid fermentation, excreting, respectively, lactate, or acetate, formate and ethanol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. At a dilution rate of 0.5&#x02009;h<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;1</sup>, Genr0 produces mainly lactate (lactate:acetate ratio close to 16). Throughout the course of the experiment, all parallel reactors shifted gradually towards mixed acid fermentation leading to a ratio of approximately 7 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). Even though this fermentative mode leads to a theoretical 50% increase in ATP yield on substrate, the biomass concentration did not change, as evolved cells also excreted more pyruvate, the final shared precursor of the homolactic and the mixed acid fermentative pathways (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b).</p><p id="Par17">During batch cultivation, evolved cells differed phenotypically from Genr0. The differences included the growth rate, length of lag phase and sedimentation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). We compared to Genr0 both the population samples collected after 445 generations and single colony isolates from the evolved population samples (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5). Prolonged cultivation under chemostat environment selected cells that cope poorly with high concentrations of glucose. Irrespective of whether the evolved populations or the isolates were compared, they were clearly outperformed by Genr0 in batch. Most notably, &#x003bc;<sub>max</sub> dropped to a value close to the dilution rate at which cells were evolved, which falls nearly 25% below the &#x003bc;<sub>max</sub> of the parent strain (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The evolved strains also exhibited extended lag phases and sedimentation during batch cultivations. The sedimentation was reminiscent of the AcmA-deficient phenotype previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Phenotypic characterization of evolved strains in batch culture The evolved strains were revived in batch culture and the growth characteristics determined (<bold>a</bold>). <bold>b</bold> Evolved strains sediment during growth.

Single isolates were chosen to keep the focus on the mutations, which gave rise to a selective advantage under the conditions tested. The population dynamics were determined after this (see section <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Population dynamics of prolonged cultivation experiments</xref>). The published whole genome sequence for <italic>L. lactis</italic> MG1363 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] was used as a reference for sequence assembly. Mutations were identified and verified by Sanger sequencing (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table&#x000a0;S2). In comparison with Genr0, we did not find any evidence to support gene amplifications or large genomic rearrangements in the evolved strains.

Growth on the preferred sugar, glucose, was studied. The type of selective pressure was kept constant, but its strength was varied by imposing different growth rates. Intriguingly, fixation of the same beneficial amino-acid substitution was found across all parallel evolutionary experiments, and for all growth rates tested. This demonstrates a high evolvability with low evolutionary plasticity for the adaptation process towards constant growth conditions under glucose-limitation i.e. one small change in the genotype was sufficient to initiate multiple phenotypic changes and strains which were able to outcompete the initial one.</p><p id="Par36">We constructed miniature chemostats to allow a stable chemostat evolution study at fixed conditions. The working volume was decreased, which allowed experiments in quadruplicate for more than 1350 consecutive generations, generating true biological replicates, which allowed us to tackle issues related to the plasticity of microbial evolution. In glucose-limited chemostats, one expects enhanced selective pressure toward increased efficiency of glucose uptake (e.g. by elevating the expression of high-affinity- rather than of low affinity transport systems). However, this did not evolve as a main mechanism, but instead, a pleiotropic mutation in the global carbon metabolism regulator CcpA that, amongst other genes, increases the expression of genes for high affinity glucose PTS systems (e.g. PTS<sup>Man</sup>). Subsequently, the effect of the up-regulation of gene expression by an increased efficiency of uptake of glucose by the evolved strains was experimentally confirmed.</p><p id="Par37">The molecular analysis of the fitness enhancing mutation in CcpA, suggests that the sequence of the DNA-binding domain determines an affinity for DNA that is advantageous in natural fluctuating environments (low-high glucose). The DNA binding domain of CcpA is highly conserved and in natural isolates of <italic>L. lactis</italic>, as well as in the CcpA proteins of other Gram-positive organisms such as <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, the Met residue is present at an equivalent position. Based on the high-resolution structures from <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, this residue directly interacts with the nucleobases in the structures containing <italic>ackA2</italic> and <italic>glntR</italic> promoter sequences but not with the synthetic <italic>cre</italic> site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Whether CcpA binds with a higher or lower affinity to certain <italic>cre</italic> sites has been investigated in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. While the focus was on the <italic>cre</italic> site sequence itself, our study gives insights into the effect of the CcpA amino acid sequence on DNA binding. The direct-binding data show that the effect of the amino acid substitution consistently results in a tighter binding of CcpA to <italic>cre</italic> sequences, although not always to the same extent for each resulting mutation. Other factors such as distance of the <italic>cre</italic> site to the transcriptional start site or other transcriptional regulators governing the expression of the operon are likely to affect gene expression as well.</p><p id="Par38">CcpA was not the only global regulator to accumulate mutations in our study, with the Phe substitution for Ile<sup>214</sup> in the DNA binding domain of CodY.

In that case, the mutation reduced glucose transport activity, thereby mimicking a low-glucose environment associated with acetogenic metabolism, a high-yield strategy. Thus, the mutant relied on the native intracellular metabolic and gene-regulatory machinery for a rather drastic phenotypic change in metabolism.</p><p id="Par40">In our study, at nutrient limitation, it appears that such an evolutionary path is not favored, but rather, the gene-regulatory circuit itself needs adjustment. Intriguingly, the same mutation occurred at two different growth rates, which require different rates of glucose uptake and glycolysis. This is only possible if the cells possess a form of non-genetic phenotypic plasticity that tolerates the adjustment of the gene-regulatory circuitry under different conditions. A recent functional genomics study of the parent Genr0 strain at different growth rates &#x02013; using the same standard cultivation conditions &#x02013; suggests that regulation at the metabolic level is the dominant form of phenotypic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

The competition experiments were preceded by running four-parallel chemostats for 10 volume changes as described above for Ds of 0.2 and 0.3&#x02009;h-1. Of the four steady states independently established for each D, three included Genr0 and one 445C1.
