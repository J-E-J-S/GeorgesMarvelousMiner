DNA repair processes represent attractive synthetic lethal targets since many cancers exhibit an impaired DNA repair pathway, which can lead to dependence on specific repair proteins<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>.

Hypothesizing that other DNA repair defects would give rise to synthetic lethal relationships, we queried dependencies in cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI), which results from deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR).

This class of hypermutation, microsatellite instability (MSI), contributes to several cancers, predominantly 15% of colon<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, 22% of gastric<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, 20&#x02013;30% of endometrial<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, and 12% of ovarian<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> cancers. MSI can arise from Lynch Syndrome<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, caused by germline mutations in MMR genes <italic>MSH2</italic>, <italic>MSH6</italic>, <italic>PMS2</italic>, or <italic>MLH1</italic>. More commonly, MSI cancers arise following somatic MMR inactivation, typically <italic>MLH1</italic> promoter hypermethylation<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. While MSI has been associated with striking responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), 45&#x02013;60% of such cancers do not respond to ICB, and use of ICB can be limited by toxicity<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Hence, novel therapies are needed for MSI tumors.</p><p id="P6">Hypothesizing that MSI/dMMR may create vulnerabilities, we queried two independent large-scale cancer dependency datasets, Project Achilles and Project DRIVE, for genes selectively essential in MSI cancer cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Project Achilles screened 517 cell lines with a genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 library, and Project DRIVE interrogated 398 cell lines with an RNAi library to define genes essential for proliferation and survival of individual cancer cell lines<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. We ascertained MSI status using next-generation sequencing (NGS)<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> quantification of deletions and fraction of deletions located within microsatellite regions, identifying three groups: MSI, MSS, and indeterminate (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). These classifications were highly concordant with PCR-based MSI phenotyping<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and with predicted dMMR (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). In total, 51 unique MSI and 541 unique MSS cell lines (exclusive of those marked indeterminate) were represented by one or both screening datasets.</p><p id="P7">Projects Achilles CRISPR/Cas9 and DRIVE each independently identified <italic>WRN,</italic> encoding a RecQ DNA helicase, as the top preferential dependency in MSI compared to MSS cell lines (<italic>Q</italic> values = 4.8&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;24</sup> and 1.5&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;45</sup>, respectively, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). These findings remained true with PCR-based MSI classifications (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). In contrast, none of the four other RecQ DNA helicases were preferentially essential with MSI (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>). We then evaluated MSI as a biomarker for <italic>WRN</italic> dependency, demonstrating that the MSI/<italic>WRN</italic> relationship compared favorably to other strong biomarkers for vulnerabilities such as the relationships of activating <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations to <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>BRAF</italic> dependencies, respectively (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figs. 1d</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">e</xref>).</p><p id="P8">MSI is most commonly observed in colorectal, endometrial, gastric, and ovarian cancers. MSI cell lines from these four lineages (<italic>n</italic> = 37) showed greater <italic>WRN</italic> dependence than their MSS counterparts (<italic>n</italic> = 91; <italic>P</italic> = 4.2&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;13</sup>, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). We also identified 14 MSI cell lines from lineages where MSI is less common (6 leukemia, 2 prostate, and single models of other lineages). However, these MSI cells were distinct, harboring a median 0.56-fold fewer deletion mutations in microsatellite regions compared to typical-lineage MSI models (<italic>P</italic> = 1.7&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). They were also less <italic>WRN</italic> dependent (<italic>P =</italic> 1.1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>), despite possessing events predictive of dMMR (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Correspondingly, the specificity of MSI as a biomarker for <italic>WRN</italic> dependency improved by delineating MSI within MSI-predominant lineages (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figs. 1d</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">e</xref>). These observations suggest that <italic>WRN</italic> dependency is not simply a result of dMMR but may require specific lineages and/or a stronger mutator phenotype. Indeed, <italic>WRN</italic> dependency correlated with the number of microsatellite deletions within all MSI cell lines and in MSI-predominant lineages (Spearman&#x02019;s rho = &#x02212;0.74, <italic>n</italic> = 54, <italic>P &#x0003c;</italic> 2.2&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup> ; Spearman&#x02019;s rho = &#x02212;0.57, <italic>n</italic> = 37, <italic>P</italic> = 3.3&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, respectively; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figs. 2c</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">d</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To further assess <italic>WRN</italic> dependency, we validated three sgRNAs targeting <italic>WRN</italic> by immunoblot (IB) (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>) and evaluated <italic>WRN</italic> knockout in 5 MSS and 5 MSI cell lines, all from MSI-predominant lineages, with an 8-day viability assay. Effects of <italic>WRN</italic> knockout were comparable to &#x02018;pan-essential&#x02019; controls in MSI cell lines. <italic>WRN</italic> silencing in MSS models instead approximated negative controls, targeting intergenic regions (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Similarly, WRN depletion impaired the viability of MSI cells despite negligible effects in MSS cells in a 10-day competitive growth assay (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>). Complementing these CRISPR/Cas9 data, <italic>WRN</italic> silencing with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) impaired MSI, but not MSS, cell viability (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figs. 3c</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). To validate that these phenotypes were attributable to <italic>WRN</italic> inactivation, we developed an sgRNA targeting a <italic>WRN</italic> exon-intron junction (sgWRN-EIJ), which silenced endogenous <italic>WRN</italic> but not exogenous <italic>WRN</italic> cDNA (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Correspondingly, <italic>WRN</italic> cDNA rescued Cas9-expressing KM12 from sgWRN-EIJ, but not sgWRN2, targeting endogenous and exogenous <italic>WRN</italic> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). These data argue that the viability loss in MSI cells is attributable to <italic>WRN</italic> inactivation.</p><p id="P10">These findings suggest that <italic>WRN</italic> dependence with MSI could be exploited by WRN inhibition. WRN protein functions as both a 3&#x02019;&#x02212;5&#x02019; exonuclease and 3&#x02019;&#x02212;5&#x02019; helicase in processes including DNA repair, DNA replication, and telomere maintenance<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. To determine which enzymatic function is essential, we attempted to rescue sgWRN-EIJ with exonuclease-dead (E84A), helicase-dead (K577M), or dually exonuclease/helicase-dead (E84A/K577M) versions of <italic>WRN</italic> cDNA<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> in KM12. Exonuclease inactivation did not attenuate rescue, suggesting this function is dispensable. By contrast, helicase inactivation prevented rescue (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">c</xref>), nominating the helicase domain as a candidate therapeutic target.</p><p id="P11">Next, we validated <italic>WRN</italic> dependency <italic>in vivo</italic> with xenografts of KM12 transduced with doxycycline (dox)-inducible shRNA targeting <italic>WRN</italic> (shWRN1) or control (shWRN1-C911) with nucleotides 9 through 11 of shWRN1 mutated to its complement, thus maintaining the &#x02018;seed&#x02019; sequence associated with shRNA off-target effects<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Induction of shWRN1 but not shWRN1-C911 significantly impaired tumor growth (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). We observed substantial depletion of WRN with shWRN1 induction <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, WRN levels recovered by three weeks (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>), mirroring tumor growth recovery, suggesting that <italic>WRN</italic> re-expression was required to overcome shWRN1 induction. We further demonstrated that shRNA targeting <italic>WRN</italic> impaired the viability of a novel patient-derived organoid generated from an MSI colon cancer (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2f</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">g</xref>). By demonstrating the synthetic lethal relationship <italic>in vivo</italic> and in a patient-derived model, these data support WRN as a therapeutic target for MSI cancers.</p><p id="P12">To pursue the basis of <italic>WRN</italic> dependency, we first performed cell cycle analyses. <italic>WRN</italic> silencing reduced the proportion of MSI cells in S phase and increased cells in G1 or G2/M phases, suggesting cell cycle arrest at either G1 or G2/M phases (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figs. 4a</xref>, <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). Furthermore, annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining demonstrated induction of apoptosis and cell death in MSI cells following <italic>WRN</italic> silencing (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figs. 4a</xref>, <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">c</xref>, <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">d</xref>).
