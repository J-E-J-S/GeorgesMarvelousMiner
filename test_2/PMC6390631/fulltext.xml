Hybridization-based target enrichment is one potential method for increasing the sensitivity of viral detection via high-throughput sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">This study expands upon two previously developed panels of virus enrichment probes (for filoviruses and for respiratory viruses) to include other viruses of biodefense and/or biosurveillance concern to the U.S. Department of Defense and various international public health agencies. The newly expanded and combined panel is tested using carefully constructed synthetic metagenomic samples that contain clinically relevant amounts of viral genetic material. Target enrichment results in a dramatic increase in sensitivity for virus detection as compared to shotgun sequencing, yielding full, deeply covered viral genomes from materials with Ct values suggesting that amplicon sequencing would be likely to fail. Increased pooling to improve cost- and time-effectiveness does not negatively affect the ability to obtain full-length viral genomes, even in the case of co-infections, although as expected, it does decrease depth of coverage.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Hybridization-based target enrichment is an effective solution to obtain full-length viral genomes for samples from which virus detection would fail via unbiased, shotgun sequencing or even via amplicon sequencing. As the development and testing of probe sets for viral target enrichment expands and continues, the application of this technique, in conjunction with deeper pooling strategies, could make high-throughput sequencing more economical for routine use in biosurveillance, biodefense and outbreak investigations.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12864-019-5543-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Genome enrichment</kwd><kwd>Virus detection</kwd><kwd>High-throughput sequencing</kwd><kwd>Virome profiling</kwd><kwd>Virome capture sequencing</kwd><kwd>Viral enrichment</kwd><kwd>Sequencing-based detection</kwd><kwd>Next generation sequencing</kwd><kwd>Hybridization-based target enrichment</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>US.

Metagenomic sequencing is the high-throughput sequencing of nucleic acid from complex samples rather than from purified microorganisms. Metagenomic sequencing is much less biased than other methods and allows for the detection of fastidious or nonculturable organisms as well as multiple unrelated pathogens within a single sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Moreover, detection via HTS is much less susceptible to false-negative results caused by antigenic drift or signature erosion. Despite these advantages, one of the technical challenges encountered with respect to metagenomic sequencing is obtaining adequate depth and breadth of coverage from pathogens like RNA viruses that i) typically have small genomes, and ii) are typically present at low titers amidst the background &#x02018;noise&#x02019; of the host and commensals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Genome size directly affects sensitivity of detection by HTS because the sampling of sequence fragments within a sample depends on the prevalence of those fragments and organisms with larger genomes typically contribute more fragments, therefore being sampled more often than organisms with smaller genomes. In other words, organisms with larger genomes have the potential to contribute a larger proportion to the overall number of sequencing reads even when the plaque-forming units (PFU), or colony-forming units (CFU) in the case of bacteria, are equivalent to that of an organism with a smaller sized genome.</p><p id="Par32">Although conventional shotgun sequencing allows for the detection of all domains of life, it rarely returns robust coverage of a small viral genome when taken from a very complex sample. A variety of possible strategies exist to enhance the sensitivity of HTS for virus detection and characterization, including purification of specific viral fractions by physical methods such as filtration and ultracentrifugation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], amplicon-based target enrichment, and hybridization-based target enrichment. Purification of viral fractions is ideal in some cases, although it can be laborious, and for certain sized samples (for instance clinical samples of very limited volume) it may not be realistic. The use of hybridization-based target enrichment could be preferable to the aforementioned technologies because it has the potential to yield sequence data covering the entire genome of multiple viruses with just one sequencing reaction by using genome-wide probes designed against multiple viruses to specifically select for viral cDNA prior to sequencing. Amplicon sequencing of viral genomes is a technique that has been widely used, but it has some disadvantages, which were articulated by Metsky et al. in a recent study of Zika virus (ZIKV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. First, traditional amplicon sequencing typically requires technically challenging normalization and pooling of individual amplicons to cover the entire genome of one specific virus. However, recently a protocol was published for efficient amplicon primer design and multiplex amplicon generation in a single tube for sequencing in the MinION or Illumina platforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although this method obviates the amplicon normalization and pooling steps and is effective for producing whole genome sequence data from a low titer ZIKV sample, this method has not been demonstrated for production of whole genome sequence data for multiple diverse viruses from a single complex sample. Additionally, amplicon sequencing typically requires as much as 40&#x02009;cycles of PCR amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which can introduce sequence errors. Furthermore, amplicon-based sequencing is vulnerable to false negative results caused by mutations in primer binding sites, as was recently demonstrated for Dengue virus (DENV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] as well as false positive variant results possibly caused by low and/or uneven coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. By contrast, the use of probes tiled along the entire length of a viral genome to hybridize and select for virus-specific fragments has the potential to produce less false-negative pathogen detection results by virtue of many more potential binding sites along an individual genome and resulting more uniform coverage.</p><p id="Par33">Ebola virus (EBOV) is one specific example of a pathogen for which false-negative PCR results can have devastating consequences and for which available PCR-based assay effectiveness has been shown to be affected by drift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, a panel of 80-mer oligonucleotide probes designed against eight Filovirus genomes was recently used for post-sequencing library enrichment in a HTS-based study of a recent EBOV outbreak in West Africa and in an investigation of potential genetic variation of EBOV in experimentally infected nonhuman primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In this protocol, viral enrichment is coupled with the RNA Access kit, developed by Illumina, Inc. The technical advancements of the RNA Access kit had already enabled the sequencing of previously unsequencable materials such as those of low concentration and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and now this protocol has been employed not only for the detection and characterization of EBOV from clinical samples but also for detection and characterization of respiratory viruses in clinical samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In general, hybridization-based viral target enrichment has been successfully employed to characterize viruses found within both contrived samples and clinical samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The performance of the Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) version of this method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], which uses probes for 34 common respiratory viruses in conjunction with the TruSeq RNA Access protocol, was recently investigated and it was demonstrated to work well overall when tested on human clinical samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Specifically, the authors reported successful enrichment for 30 of 33 human clinical samples tested. Importantly, RT-PCR was conducted on those same samples and Ct values of respiratory viruses in those clinical samples ranged from 21 to 33 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], which provides a framework for beginning to assess the limits of detection of hybridization-based enrichment sequencing. Herein, we extend this approach by i) expanding this viral probe panel to include viruses of biosurveillance and biodefense concern and ii) employing carefully constructed mock clinical samples to systematically assess this technique&#x02019;s performance in a variety of conditions, such as deeper multiplexing for cost effectiveness as well as more extensive co-infection scenarios. We demonstrate the sensitivity and reproducibility of hybridization-based viral enrichment sequencing despite virus divergence and we show that this sensitivity is maintained even with extensive multiplexing of samples to decrease cost. Herein we demonstrate that within one reaction tube, this technique can even be used to detect and discriminate between multiple serotypes of a virus within a clinical sample or to detect and discriminate amongst multiple unrelated viruses that present similar clinical symptoms, and we demonstrate this performance at clinically relevant concentrations of virus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Hybridization-based target enrichment enhances sensitivity of HTS for detection of virus in complex environmental samples</title><p id="Par34">Enhanced detection of viruses from various clinical sample types using filovirus- or respiratory virus-specific probes has recently been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

In order to test this newly expanded probe panel and to specifically assess the effect of hybridization-based viral enrichment on the sensitivity of HTS for detection of a single virus within a complex environmental sample, commercial bat guano was spiked with increasing concentrations of Influenza virus (IFV). Spiked samples were split into two parts each, with each part being processed in parallel with unbiased, shotgun sequencing versus target enrichment sequencing using an expanded panel of

Briefly, varying titers of ZIKV, Dengue virus 2 (DENV-2), and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) were spiked into RNA extracted from human serum, in duplicate, to create synthetic co-infection samples. Negative control samples consisted solely of RNA extracted from human serum. Viruses were spiked-in at concentrations corresponding to Ct values from standard curves generated via RT-qPCR.

Specifically, synthetic clinical samples were also constructed to contain a different strain of ZIKV than the strain the probes were designed against (strain R116265 rather than strain MR766, which is the strain whose reference genome was used for probe design; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a and b) and a different species of Human Adenovirus (HAdV) than the probes were designed to target (HAdV-51, a member of species D; as opposed to species C, B, and E, which the probes target specifically; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>g and h). These samples were also constructed to include biological replicates and were probed singly or in pools of four or 12. In all cases, the spiked-in virus was detectable, although there was some variation in depth of coverage among multiplexed samples.

Small viral genomes present at low concentrations are effectively drowned out by signal from host nucleic acid and from commensal microorganisms. A variety of methods have been employed to increase the viral signal in high-throughput sequence data, including amplicon sequencing, but for viruses like DENV, with its genome of less than 11&#x02009;kb in size, even amplicon sequencing is regarded as an inefficient approach for samples with Ct values of 29 or higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Such limitations have been of particular concern for U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) laboratories tasked with biosurveillance and biodefense activities in regions with limited material resources and human expertise. Part of the motivation for this effort was to provide DoD laboratories operating in austere environments new tools aimed at enhancing on-site sequencing capacity when engaged in Force Health Protection (FHP) activities.</p><p id="Par43">We demonstrate here that hybridization-based viral target enrichment yields robust coverage of small genomes from clinical samples, even yielding full-length, deeply covered genomes at concentrations whereby current amplicon sequencing protocols may be expected to fail. Moreover, we demonstrate that hybridization-based target enrichment can allow for not only detection, but also genetic characterization such as strain-level discrimination, even at very low concentrations of virus. The capability to detect and discriminate between multiple serotypes of a virus within a complex sample at clinically relevant concentrations by using this enrichment method increases the utility of high throughput sequencing for biosurveillance and for infectious disease diagnostics. For both biosurveillance and clinical sequencing, assay cost and time are important considerations. We have demonstrated that more extensive pooling and multiplexing can be performed to reduce cost and time without sacrificing the assay&#x02019;s ability to detect at least two strains of related virus and a variety of unrelated viruses in one sequencing reaction.</p><p id="Par44">To date, the published viral target enrichment studies vary in focus and include characterization of EBOV during a recent outbreak in West Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and detection of multiple viral families within clinical samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. While the probes employed in the studies published to date vary in length from 50- to 120-mers, enrichment methods also can differ by the number of probes and target viruses included in a set. An additional potential protocol difference is the number of samples pooled, which ranges from a single sample to 12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The current recommendation by Illumina for viral enrichment is to pool four samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">The experiments described here systematically test enrichment of a single library as well as pools of four or 12 libraries and include a variety of titers of as many as three viruses within a single sample and as many as 12 samples within an enriched pool. For all conditions, even with more extensive pooling and multiplexing, we observed a dose-dependent response to varying Ct values even in co-infected clinical samples. A dose dependent response was also observed by O&#x02019;Flaherty et al. in two co-infected samples containing Respiratory Syncytial virus and human Coronavirus OC43 spiked-in each at Ct 28 or 32 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Interestingly, although there was the expected dose-dependent effect on the proportion of sequencing reads derived from IFV as the concentration of spiked IFV gRNA increased, there was a slight decrease in the proportion of MERS-CoV-derived sequencing reads in samples at the upper end of the IFV gRNA concentration range. This was not expected given that MERS-CoV was present in each replicate at a constant, high level. We hypothesize that this may be due to saturation of the streptavidin beads used to capture probe-cDNA hybridized fragments. Further experimentation will be required to test that hypothesis.</p><p id="Par46">Efficacy of probes varies by homology to the viral target, as evidenced by our results and those in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For example, the reference sequence used to design the probe set for DENV-1 exhibits&#x000a0;74% nucleotide identity over 35% of the length of the closest sequenced reference for the DENV-2 strain that was spiked. It is possible that this overlap, which is not shared by the DENV-2 probes and DENV-1 spike-in, contributed to an overrepresentation of DENV-1 reads in the experiments presented in Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Additionally, by comparison to the other richly covered strains of virus tested in multiplexed samples, there was an underwhelming coverage for both strains of ZIKV. It is possible that the quality of RNA from these viruses was less than the other RNA spike-ins, or that the probe panel for ZIKV is less efficacious when used in combination with the entirety of the probe set. The probes for ZIKV were synthesized and added later after all the other probes were combined (in response to the recent outbreak) and therefore it is possible that the comparatively lower performance of the ZIKV probes is due to a difference in quantitation of the ZIKV probe set.</p><p id="Par47">We observed that HAdV-51 (species D) genetic material was efficiently enriched even though the only adenoviruses used to design the probe panel were species B, C, and E. This experiment indicates that the protocol works as well for this particular DNA virus as it does for RNA viruses. Limits of detection may vary by viral target, which may explain why previously published experiments showed differences between DNA and RNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Nucleotide identity between human adenovirus species D (the species to which HAdV-51 belongs) and the other human adenovirus species HAdV-A, B, C, and E was reported by Kaneko et al. to range from 58.73 to 69.35% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In our study, the probe panel containing probes for species HAdV-B, C, and E effectively enriched for the entirety of the HAdV-D genome. This suggests that when using long (80-mer) probes designed against several species of virus, related non-targeted species may also be enriched without being specifically included in the panel, if the nucleotide identity among them is at least 60&#x02013;70%, and if multiple related species are targeted by the probes in the panel (in this case three species). This cross-reactivity for related human pathogens could prove to be a useful feature, by allowing for enrichment of more relevant viruses without added cost spent to increase the number of probes.</p><p id="Par48">Our findings demonstrate that breadth of coverage does not suffer from extensive pooling but that deeper depth of coverage is gained by limiting the number of samples pooled. Extensive pooling makes hybridization-based enrichment sequencing more economical. Viral target enrichment could be applied as an economical approach to sequencing viruses known to mutate quickly and therefore evade other assays, fastidious organisms, or complex samples of limited volume. For example, this method could be prescribed to a scenario in which multiple serotypes of a virus such as DENV are expected to be present in a sample but detection is prohibited via conventional methods such as amplicon sequencing due to low titers. Viral target enrichment designed for a broad panel of targets could also be useful to the infectious disease field by enabling detection of low-titer viruses present in clinical samples taken from patients suffering from symptoms of unknown etiology. Another applicable use of a broad probe panel could be to perform environmental sampling. The aforementioned applications often involve complex samples of limited volume, for which this method is ideal. An important caveat to this approach is that while viral target enrichment is an economical method by which to reduce background noise in a metagenomic sample, probe design requires prior knowledge of the closest-sequenced genome for each viral target. Amplicon sequencing may be the best approach for previously known samples and unbiased whole shotgun sequencing may be more appropriate for a virus-rich sample. None of these approaches obviates the use of amplification by polymerase chain reaction or the potential introduction of sequence errors, and so standard quality analyses by computational methods should always be employed. As the development and testing of probe sets for viral target enrichment expands and continues, the application of this technique could make HTS more economical for routine use in Force Health Protection activities including biosurveillance, biodefense and outbreak investigations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Preparation of contrived metagenomic samples and nucleic acid extraction and quality control</title><p id="Par49">IFV (H1N1) particles (A/Swine/Iowa/15/30; ATCC, Manassas, VA), MERS-CoV RNA (Jordan-N3/2012; NAMRU-3), HAdV nucleic acid extract from particles (RI-67 and Bom; ATCC, Manassas, VA), ZIKV RNA extract from particles (MR766 and R116265; ATCC, Manassas, VA), CHIKV RNA (gift from LTC Richard Jarman, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research), DENV-1 RNA extract from particles (TH-SMAN; ATCC, Manassas, VA) and DENV-2 RNA extract from particles (New Guinea C; ATCC, Manassas, VA) were spiked into relevant matrices to construct contrived metagenomic samples for testing.</p><p id="Par50">To prepare guano samples five-gram quantities of commercial Jamaican bat guano (Planet Natural; Bozeman, MT) were placed in 50&#x02009;mL of sterile-filtered Hank&#x02019;s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS), vortexed to mix, centrifuged at 3,100 x g for 10&#x02009;min, and filtered sequentially through 0.45&#x02009;&#x003bc;m and 0.22&#x02009;&#x003bc;m filters prior to spiking with IFV particles.

In general, genomes were tiled with capture oligos in a way so as to avoid low-complexity sequences and repetitive sequences. Probe spacing and overlap vary per virus due to attempts to design probes that cover multiple related virus strains resulting in overlapping tiled design around more variable regions, whereas regions more conserved among multiple strains resulted in probes more or less tiled end-to-end.
