We previously found that TMPRSS4 promotes NSCLC growth and constitutes a prognostic biomarker. Here, through large-scale analyses across 5 public databases we identified consistent co-expression between TMPRSS4 and DDR1. Similar to TMPRSS4, DDR1 promoter was hypomethylated in NSCLC in 3 independent cohorts and hypomethylation was an independent prognostic factor of disease-free survival. Treatment with 5-azacitidine increased DDR1 levels in cell lines, suggesting an epigenetic regulation. Cells lacking TMPRSS4 were highly sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of the DDR1 inhibitor dasatinib. TMPRSS4/DDR1 double knock-down (KD) cells, but not single KD cells suffered a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest with loss of E2F1 and cyclins A and B, increased p21 levels and a larger number of cells in apoptosis. Moreover, double KD cells were highly sensitized to cisplatin, which caused massive apoptosis (~40%). <italic>In vivo</italic> studies demonstrated tumor regression in double KD-injected mice. In conclusion, we have identified a novel vulnerability in NSCLC resulting from a synthetic lethal interaction between DDR1 and TMPRSS4.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Non-small-cell lung cancer</kwd><kwd>Prognostic markers</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a consequence of both genetic and epigenetic changes that alter intracellular pathways leading to proliferation and invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

Using this strategy in NSCLC in the present study, we have found that TMPRSS4 is co-overexpressed with Discoidin Domain Receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (DDR1), a membrane protein that promotes cancer cell growth and dissemination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. We have also found that both TMPRSS4 and DDR1 are co-regulated by promoter hypomethylation, which is associated with poor prognosis.

The strategy for the identification of the TMPRSS4-associated gene signature is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>. To this end, we carried out large-scale correlation analyses across 5 public databases and found that 362 genes were significantly coexpressed with TMPRSS4 in lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC) and 48 in the case of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), in all databases. Comparison of both gene sets identified a common 28-gene signature. Next, this signature was filtered out by considering just those genes that showed significantly different expression between normal and tumor lung samples in TCGA, which narrowed down the list to 18 (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Heat map analysis of the 18-gene signature showed that most of these genes were up-regulated in tumors (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1A</xref>). GO and IPA bioinformatic analyses revealed that most of these genes were related to cell adhesion and interaction with the ECM (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Protein-protein network interactions using STRING<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> showed that nine of the genes were significantly interconnected (FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; enrichment value p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). This suggests that tumors with high TMPRSS4 expression may be associated with pathways involving cancer cell-ECM crosstalk in NSCLC, in agreement with the prometastatic role of TMPRSS4.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(<bold>A)</bold> Schematic representation of the strategy used to identify genes coexpressed with TMPRSS4 in public databases.

We addressed whether the expression of TMPRSS4 and DDR1 would be mutually regulated in lung cancer cells. To this end we used H358 cells (with high expression of both genes) where we knocked-down either TMPRSS4 or DDR1. DDR1 levels were not reduced in clones where TMPRSS4 expression was depleted.

The DDR1 promoter contains a CpG island (from cg23001000 to cg26858073), flanked by a 5&#x02032; upstream shore (north) and a 3&#x02032; downstream shore (south). In the CURELUNG cohort, representation of cumulative difference in the percentage of methylation between 89 consecutive CpGs in the aforementioned promoter regions comparing normal and malignant tissues showed a steep slope in the north shore and, in a lesser extent, in the south shore (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>).

Based on the hypothesis that these cooperative genes could be consistently co-expressed in tumors, we searched for TMPRSS4-correlated genes in publicly available genomic data and identified DDR1 among other genes related to cancer cell-ECM interaction. We have previously shown that levels of TMPRSS4 in NSCLC are much higher than those found in normal lung and that overexpression associates with worse prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Moreover, increased TMPRSS4 levels are due to DNA hypomethylation, which is also associated with reduced DFS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. We have found in the present study that, similar to TMPRSS4, hypomethylation of DDR1 causes DDR1 overexpression and that both expression and methylation status can be used as prognostic indicators in NSCLC. It is worth noticing that the degree of promoter methylation found for DDR1 is highly correlated with that of TMPRSS4 in NSCLC patients and cancer cell lines. Importantly, treatment of cells with 5-azacitidine increased levels of DDR1, a result that was also reported for TMPRSS4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. All these data suggest that these genes are co-regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Our results also show that expression levels of both genes are not mutually regulated. Therefore, it is possible that they share transcription factors and epigenetic regulators that control expression, although this hypothesis will have to be addressed in future studies.</p><p id="Par23">Both TMPRSS4 and DDR1 have been shown to promote proliferation, migration, invasion and metastasis in NSCLC cells and in other cell types, depending on the cell context<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.

First, dasatinib was significantly more effective at inhibiting proliferation in cells with no TMPRSS4 than in controls. In addition, co-silencing completely blocked proliferation and triggered apoptosis. We have demonstrated that double KD cells suffered G0/G1 cell cycle arrest accompanied by a decrease in the percentage of the cell population in the S and G2/M phases, with loss of cyclins A and B1, but not in cyclins D1 and E.

The synthetic lethality has been defined as the inability of cells to proliferate when co-targeting two genes, with a synergistically superior inhibition than that found for each individual gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Consistent co-expression of two genes involved in a similar function is a predictor of synthetic lethality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, a strategy that is being applied to find out novel cancer vulnerabilities. The typical example of synthetic lethality is applied to mutations affecting a similar pathway, such as BRCA/PARP, where co-targeting leaves cells unprotected from DNA damage and repair.

As a hypothesis we can speculate that alteration in MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways might be responsible for this effect. Indeed, signaling triggered by both TMPRSS4 and DDR1 in cancer cells activate common pathways, including phosphorylation in ERK1/2 and AKT depending on the cellular context<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.

As synthetic lethality frequently occurs when targeting genes from parallel pathways involved in similar functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, it is possible that blockade of both TMPRSS4 and DDR1 makes cells succumb to insufficient proliferation/survival signals. In fact, it has been demonstrated in cancer cells that co-targeting of the Ras/ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways with kinase inhibitors or genetic knockdown approaches targeting members of these pathways results in synthetic lethality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par27">Co-inhibition of TMPRSS4 and DDR1 could then constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for NSCLC.
