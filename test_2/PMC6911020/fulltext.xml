Luciferases are such genetically encoded candidates due to their sensitivity, versatility, and cost-effectiveness. We expand luciferase multiplexing in post-lysis endpoint luciferase assays from two to six. Light emissions are distinguished by a combination of distinct substrates and emission spectra deconvolution. All six luciferase reporter units are stitched together into one plasmid facilitating delivery of all reporter units through a process we termed solotransfection, minimizing experimental errors. We engineer a multiplex hextuple luciferase assay to probe pathway fluxes through five transcriptional response elements against a control constitutive promoter. We can monitor effects of siRNA, ligand, and chemical compound treatments on their target pathways along with the four other probed cellular pathways. We demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptiveness of multiplex luciferase assaying, and its broad application across different research fields.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Multiplexed detection of luciferase-based sensors in the same sample is challenging and limited by the substrates&#x02019; emission spectra.

However, due to the complexity of biological systems, screens based on single biological measurements yield only limited information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Additional screening assays must be performed to expand information content, but this often requires protracted assay development, time, and/or expense. Moreover, independently performed screens may not always be appropriately controlled, making comparative analysis across different experimental variables difficult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Multiplexed cellular screens seek to address these limitations by measuring multiple readouts from a single screening unit simultaneously. Multiplexed biological screening from a single sample can provide a more detailed cellular signature, allowing greater perspective into the nuances which differentiate normal versus disease-associated processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Moreover, multiple simultaneous measurements of the same sample enable correlation and comparison between experimental variables and biological effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Some examples of multiplexed biological screening already exist that rely on fluorescent labeling. Modern flow cytometry can analyze the presence of up to 30 different antigens using labeled antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, whereas cell painting measures the presence of a multitude of morphological features of cells using a combination of fluorescent dyes and automated image analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. On the other hand, to accommodate the sensitive reporting of subtle changes in signaling pathway activities over large dynamic ranges, luciferase reporters have emerged as a promising addition to the multiplex biological screening toolbox<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Luciferase reporters are widely used in biomedical research for a variety of applications, including gene expression, intracellular signaling, transcription factor characterization, receptor activity, protein folding, drug screening, analytics, and immune-based assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Luciferases have many advantages over fluorescent proteins, such as higher sensitivity, wider dynamic detection range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and the absence of auto-luminescence in mammalian cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Luciferases are categorized by their enzymatic activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>: the beetle luciferases first activate their substrate (D-Luciferin and derivatives) to a product whose oxidation results in light emission, whereas the marine luciferases directly oxidize their substrate (coelenterazine, vargulin, or furimazine), generating an excited-state molecule that emits a photon. Similar to fluorescent proteins, each luciferase has a unique emission spectrum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> that enables detection of two or more luciferases simultaneously as long as the spectra are distinguishable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Most multiplex luciferase experiments today measure the light emitted from two luciferases in succession<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The first, which is typically FLuc, a firefly (<italic>Photinus pyralis)</italic> luciferase, utilizes D-Luciferin and is used to monitor a cellular signaling event of interest. The second enzyme, often the Renilla luciferase of <italic>Renilla reniformis</italic> (Renilla) that uses coelenterazine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> or the brighter NLuc (a synthetic version of the <italic>Oplophorus gracilirostris</italic> luciferase) that uses furimazine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, is used as an internal control. These dual-luciferase assays allow sequential quantitative measurements of both luciferase activities in the same sample, thereby eliminating pipetting errors that could occur if measurements were performed from different samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In recent years, researchers have also developed their own (non-commercial) versions of these assays with presumably similar performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Inspired by the urgent need to report on subtle changes in multiple signaling pathway activities over large dynamic ranges, and the variety in substrate and spectral properties inherent to natural luciferase enzymes, we decided to explore multiplex capabilities for luciferase-based reporter systems. Here we report multiplexed luciferase reporter assaying, capable of measuring six parameters within the same experiment, called multiplex hextuple luciferase assaying. We demonstrate the utility of this assaying by simultaneously monitoring the direct and collateral effects of introducing siRNAs, pharmaceutical drugs, and ligands targeted toward specific pathways. Our multiplex hextuple luciferase assaying is adaptable to most cellular signaling pathways of interest, cost-effective, easy to integrate into any research setting already using the dual-luciferase assay, and offers the immediate implementation in large-scale multiplex drug screening efforts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Concept of multiplex luciferase assaying</title><p id="Par8">The commonly used dual-luciferase assay orthogonally detects FLuc and Renilla through sequential application of their unique substrates, D-Luciferin and coelenterazine, with proper quenching of light emission from the first enzyme before the second substrate is introduced. This is accomplished through the addition of buffers at specific time points during the assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Cells are usually co-transfected with two plasmids, one encoding a control luciferase reporter and the other encoding a pathway-specific luciferase reporter, are washed and lysed before addition of D-Luciferin and subsequent measurement of its emission. Then a quencher is added in the presence of coelenterazine, and its emission is measured (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). Based on this paradigm, we explored different options for expanding the number of luciferases catalyzing each sequential stage using readily available reagents (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Criteria for luciferases in multiplex luciferase assaying</title><p id="Par9">We used four criteria to identify luciferases that might be orthogonally detected in a single multiplex luciferase experiment: (1) preference for consumption of a single substrate over any other, and potential for luminescence quenching, (2) in cases where the same substrate is preferred, they must exhibit minimally overlapping emission spectra that can be distinguished by emission filters and/or mathematical computation, (3) stable light emission throughout the experiment to ensure high quality measurements, and (4) a wide dynamic range for light emission to be able to detect subtle differences in pathway activities. We assessed these four criteria for 12 luciferases: 6 have been reported to emit light using D-Luciferin as a substrate, 1 to prefer furimazine, and 5 to prefer coelenterazine (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>List of luciferases evaluated in this study.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Abbreviation</th><th>Full name</th><th>Luciferase and origin</th><th>Substrate</th><th>Emission peak (nm)</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><bold>ELuc</bold></td><td><underline>E</underline>nhanced Beetle <underline>Luc</underline>iferase</td><td>Green luciferase from <italic>Pyrearinus termitilluminans</italic></td><td>D-Luciferin</td><td>537</td><td><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup></td></tr><tr><td><bold>CBG</bold></td><td><underline>C</underline>lick <underline>B</underline>eetle <underline>G</underline>reen Luciferase</td><td>Green luciferase from <italic>Pyrophorus plagiophthalamus</italic></td><td>D-Luciferin</td><td>537</td><td><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup></td></tr><tr><td><bold>RoLuc</bold></td><td><italic><underline>R</underline></italic>. <italic><underline>o</underline></italic><italic>hbai</italic>

Luciferases that prefer coelenterazine as a substrate are generally brighter than those that prefer D-Luciferin so we diluted 10 times the lysates of cells expressing the coelenterazine-specific luciferases to prevent detection saturation. In total 6 of the 12 luciferases were responsive to D-Luciferin as expected; however, some, albeit significantly reduced, luminescence levels remained for some of the D-Luciferin-specific luciferases after addition of quencher and coelenterazine.

ELuc, FLuc, and RedF have distinct emission spectra with maxima at 537&#x02009;nm, 562&#x02009;nm, and 617&#x02009;nm, respectively that can be exploited in multiplexing experiments (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>). However, It would be impractical to attempt to distinguish between the emission spectra of the coelenterazine-responsive luciferases (NLuc, Renilla, MetLuc, Lucia, GLuc, and GrRenilla) since Renilla, MetLuc, Lucia, and GLuc exhibit maximum emission within 7&#x02009;nm of each other (482&#x02013;487&#x02009;nm) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c</xref>).

ELuc, FLuc, and RedF are glow-type luciferases that exhibit a prolonged stable signal but with lower intensity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>, left, and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a, b-e</xref>, top, left). ELuc plateaued after 12&#x02009;s and remained very stable over time, but FLuc and RedF required more time for the luminescence signal to stabilize. In fact, FLuc emission did not plateau in the 180&#x02009;s after substrate injection despite a slight change in signal after 25&#x02009;s. RedF was very stable between 20 and 70&#x02009;s and then decayed slowly. The optimal period for measuring these luciferases was determined to be at 30&#x02009;s post-injection (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>, right, and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5e</xref>, right). Since the intensity of D-Luciferin-responsive luciferases is lower compared to the coelenterazine-responsive ones, we proceeded with 2-second measurement windows.</p><p id="Par17">In contrast, NLuc, Renilla, and GrRenilla are flash-type luciferases that elicit a stronger yet shorter-lived signal (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>, left, and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a-e</xref>, left). We determined that the best window for measuring these luciferases was at 7&#x02009;s post-injection because the luminescence of NLuc decays quickly after 10&#x02009;s (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>, right, and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6e</xref>, right). Due to their strong luminescence, only 1-second measurements were needed for these luciferases.</p><p id="Par18">It is important to note that quenching kinetics of the D-Luciferin-responsive luciferases must be fast to minimize background during the second step of the assay. Fortunately, the luminescence dropped to background levels within 4&#x02009;s post-injection and did not affect measurements of the coelenterazine-responsive luciferases (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5b-d</xref>, bottom). Based on all of these results, we established a protocol for multiplex hextuple luciferase assaying (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>).

We performed Sanger sequencing, restriction enzyme fingerprinting, and uncut supercoiled conformation analysis to ensure that every plasmid generated was correct, intact, and stable (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g, h</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>).</p><p id="Par25">To distinguish classical cotransfection methods from that which introduces multiple genetic elements carried on a single plasmid constructed by synthetic assembly cloning, we propose the term solotransfection. Our multiplex construct incorporates all six transcription units on the same vector, ensuring an identical copy number of each unit in every transfected cell. In contrast, the classical cotransfection method relies on equal plasmid uptake by every cell, generating greater variability between (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). We compared both transfection methods by solotransfecting the multigenic vector in one sample and cotransfecting a similar number of molecules for each of the six individual plasmids in a second cell sample (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Luciferase measurements were performed at 24&#x02009;h post-transfection and absolute luminescence values for the six luciferases (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) were plotted for both methods in three different cell lines (A549, HEK293T/17, and SK-BR-3) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b&#x02013;d</xref>). The trend displayed by the six luciferases was similar for both approaches across the three cell lines. However, luminescence in the solotransfection experiment exhibited a smaller coefficient of variation (%CV), demonstrating that solotransfection of all reporter units assembled onto one vector leads to more consistent results than cotransfection of six individual plasmids expressing a single reporter unit. This trend was not only observed while comparing cotransfection versus solotransfection of all six transcriptional units. Cotransfecting even just two, or three, four, five and again six transcriptional units, resulted in larger coefficients of variations compared to solotransfection of the six transcriptional units (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16a</xref>). This indicates that, besides simplifying the transfection process, the overall error of the experiment will be reduced when all units are solotransfected, ensuring robust experimental rigor and reproducibility.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Solotransfection of a single multi-luciferase reporter vector results in lower experimental variability than cotransfection of six individual luciferase reporters.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic illustrating cellular uptake and variability issues likely encountered during cotransfection of six individual plasmids each encoding a single luciferase transcriptional unit (Top).

Nutlin-3 is a small molecule that selectively activates the p53 pathway by blocking MDM2 repression of TP53. Cells with wild-type (WT) TP53 function (<italic>e.g</italic>., ZR-75-1 and MCF7 cell lines) exhibit TP53 activation after Nutlin-3 treatment, followed by cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>, left).

More advanced innovations toward multiplexing allow for the simultaneous detection of three luciferases with activities that can be spectrally distinguished using appropriate emission filters after the addition of one<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> or more substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Alternatively, three luciferases that each use a unique substrate have been used to monitor three distinct cellular phenomena in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> or, sequentially, in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Thus, currently the maximum number of luciferases that can be measured simultaneously is only three. Since applications of these tri-luciferase detection methods have not been broadly implemented, it is fair to say that today luciferase multiplexing is limited to two.</p><p id="Par36">Here we demonstrate an approach that enables the detection of six luciferases simultaneously in a single endpoint post-lysis experiment using standard, well characterized, reagents. Our hextuple reporter assaying method multiplexes six luciferase enzymes whose activities can be uniquely determined by combining orthogonal substrate usage, selective quenching of the luminescence, and spectral decomposition. The assay enables the examination of five cellular activities against a constitutively active reporter. Successful implementation of the assay requires that appropriate filters and readout times are used, and that luminescences are within the dynamic range of the assay, which spans from &#x0003e;10<sup>6</sup> to &#x02265;10<sup>4</sup> RLU/s for the D-Luciferin luciferases and from &#x0003e;10<sup>7</sup> to &#x02265;10<sup>5</sup> RLU/s for the coelenterazine luciferases. To facilitate this assaying, we also established a versatile and adaptable cloning pipeline to generate a multigenic vector that contains all six luciferase reporter units. While we incorporated reporter elements for five specific cellular pathways, any other pathway could easily be included depending on the biomedical problem to be probed. Moreover, this work demonstrates that solotransfection of a single multi-reporter is favored over cotransfection of six individual vectors, decreasing variability between biological replicates and providing an additional level of experimental control. In conclusion, our approach reported here allows for simultaneous readout of transcriptional activity of five cellular activities providing a much deeper understanding of cellular pathway activities of interest.</p><p id="Par37">The development of a technology or the substantial expansion of an existing technology always raises concerns and limitations. One concern of our method may be the size of the plasmid used (13.4&#x02009;kb), potentially limiting its applicability using hard to transform cell lines. However, Lipofectamine 3000-mediated transfection, the transformation method used in the present study, can be substituted for by any other method, including many other lipofection or chemical transfection methods, as well as electroporation, sonoporation, and viral transduction methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Alternatively, stable cell line clones can be isolated by selection after any of the above mentioned transformation methods, previously demonstrated to work for plasmids up to hundreds of kilobases in size, including bacterial artificial chromosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. To reduce variability of measurements as much as possible, stable cell lines could be generated by the targeted integration of all multiplex reporters at the same defined site in the genome, such as a safe harbor site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, resulting in the neutralization of genomic position effects. Cells with such genome-integrated luciferase reporters can then be further used to explore luciferase multiplexing towards in vivo bioluminescence applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Another concern may be potential cross-talk between the reporters integrated into the same plasmid by synthetic biology. In our multiplex reporter construct, besides a transcription terminator downstream of each transcriptional reporter unit, we have also included a well-characterized transcription blocker element in between each of the units (<italic>i.e</italic>., a synthetic polyA terminator and the RNA polymerase II transcriptional pause signal from the human &#x003b1;2 globin gene), to prevent transcriptional interference between different pathway-responsive luciferase transcriptional units<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In this work, we demonstrate that cross-talk between the different response elements located on the same plasmid couldn&#x02019;t be observed. Also, experiments should exclude the possibility that the tested drugs may inhibit the enzymatic activities of one or more luciferases in the assay, as previously reported for Pifithrin-&#x003b1;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. This becomes especially important in high-throughput drug screens, where numerous candidates will be identified of which some may be false positive hits due to interference with luciferase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, careful follow-up studies, as illustrated in this work, should be performed to exclude interference of isolated compounds on luciferase activity. Furthermore, while the current study involves intracellularly localized luciferases, endpoint post-lysis experimentation only allows for a single multiplex measurement. One potential solution is the adding of a membrane export signal to each luciferase to help their extracellular secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>; combining this approach with the generation of stably integrated cell line clones, longitudinal reporter studies and multiple multiplex measurements become possible by taking small media samples for analysis at defined points over time. Finally, in this study, native luciferases without the addition of PEST proteolysis sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> were used, resulting in high basal expression levels and subsequently low fold induction levels. Those induction levels could be improved by adding such PEST sequences to each luciferase.</p><p id="Par38">In future work, more luciferases could be integrated to expand the capabilities of this assay. Approaches to accomplish this include molecular modification of existing luciferases into regions of emission spectra not yet covered by the D-Luciferin- or coelenterazine-responsive luciferases or investigation of luciferases that utilize other substrates such as vargulin and furimazine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Additional luciferases can be easily incorporated in our multiplex pipeline by synthetic assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. It is noteworthy to mention that plate reader hardware currently only provides two injectors and therefore only accommodates the simultaneous use of two luciferase substrates. We hope that this work will stimulate plate reader hardware improvements to accommodate the implementation of three or more luciferase substrates in the near future. Alternatively, compatibility with other non-luciferase reporters could be explored to expand the assay capabilities even further.</p><p id="Par39">Besides applications in cancer research, as demonstrated here, hextuple luciferase assaying can be used to study other cellular pathways or complex diseases. By using the hextuple luciferase reporter system, it will be possible to simultaneously monitor the activities of five nuclear receptors by placing the specific regulatory elements upstream of five different luciferases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>, making it possible to measure nuclear receptor cross-reactivities, determine natural ligand specificity, and screen for agonists and antagonists at the same time. Hextuple luciferase assaying could also be used to monitor five known transcription factor activities downstream of the insulin receptor signaling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>, enabling an investigator to probe environmental factors and pharmaceuticals affecting insulin sensitivity in different cell types. The assay could be tailored to study the innate immune responses of host cells during viral infection, which is predominantly mediated by three types of receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Furthermore, measuring the activities of transcription factors acting downstream of these pathways would reveal correlations between viral susceptibility and the innate immune response. Multiplex luciferase assays will also be tremendously helpful in the quantification and comparison of genetic regions for synthetic biology applications both in vitro and, with some adaptations in vivo. Current methods to assess these regions and enable predictive engineering of synthetic genetic circuits rely mostly on dual-luciferase assay outputs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>; therefore, implementing multiplex luciferase assay approaches will increase the rate and reliability of these assessments. Finally, while luciferase multiplexing was solely explored in the context of in vitro transcriptional reporter assaying during this study, similar approaches can be implemented to explore multiplex capabilities for other in vitro approaches (protein translation reporters, biosensors and others), as well as in vivo bioluminescence imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par40">In conclusion, the dual-luciferase reporter system has become a staple of modern biological research and the necessary hardware has become reasonably ubiquitous. Multiplexed versions will likely be adopted across a diversity of biological disciplines, and the need for more information-rich experimental designs will lead to applications beyond the traditional dual-luciferase system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>DNA synthesis, synthetic assembly, and molecular biology</title><p id="Par41">Molecular biology experiments, including plasmid maps and <italic>in silico</italic> experimentation, were designed and generated using SnapGene software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.snapgene.com/products/snapgene/">http://www.snapgene.com/products/snapgene/</ext-link>) (GSL Biotech LLC).
