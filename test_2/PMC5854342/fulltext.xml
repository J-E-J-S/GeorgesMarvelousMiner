Degradation products produced during thermochemical pretreatment, however, inhibit the microbes with regard to both ethanol yield and cell growth. In this work, we used synthetic hydrolysates (SynH) to study the inhibition of yeast fermentation by water-soluble components (WSC) isolated from lignin streams obtained after extractive ammonia pretreatment (EA). We found that SynH with 20g/L WSC mimics real hydrolysate in cell growth, sugar consumption and ethanol production. However, a long lag phase was observed in the first 48 h of fermentation of SynH, which is not observed during fermentation with the crude extraction mixture. Ethyl acetate extraction was conducted to separate phenolic compounds from other water-soluble components. These phenolic compounds play a key inhibitory role during ethanol fermentation. The most abundant compounds were identified by Liquid Chromatography followed by Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) and Gas Chromatography followed by Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), including coumaroyl amide, feruloyl amide and coumaroyl glycerol. Chemical genomics profiling was employed to fingerprint the gene deletion response of yeast to different groups of inhibitors in WSC and AFEX-Pretreated Corn Stover Hydrolysate (ACSH). The sensitive/resistant genes cluster patterns for different fermentation media revealed their similarities and differences with regard to degradation compounds.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006132</institution-id><institution>Office of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-FC02-07ER64494</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dale</surname><given-names>Bruce E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>University of Houston (US) and State of Texas</institution></funding-source><award-id>startup funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3109-5156</contrib-id><name><surname>Balan</surname><given-names>Venkatesh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the DOE Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.greatlakesbioenergy.org">www.greatlakesbioenergy.org</ext-link>) funded by the U.

Dependence on crude oil causes energy security concerns and greenhouse gas emissions drive climate change. These forces have triggered worldwide research towards the development of alternative, sustainable sources of energy [<xref rid="pone.0194012.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A renewable alternative to fossil fuel-derived liquid fuels, such as gasoline and diesel, is lignocellulosic biofuels. These are expected to play a major role in satisfying our energy needs [<xref rid="pone.0194012.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0194012.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Unlike corn grain-based ethanol, where the starch can be readily hydrolyzed to fermentable sugars using enzymes, the lignocellulosic biomass used in second-generation biofuels has naturally evolved to be highly recalcitrant to enzymatic deconstruction by fungi and bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0194012.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass is necessary for biofuel production by reducing the recalcitrance of biomass and enabling efficient conversion to monomeric sugars [<xref rid="pone.0194012.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Pretreatment processes are commonly performed under high temperature, high pressure, caustic, or acidic conditions, which generate degradation compounds that inhibit microorganisms [<xref rid="pone.0194012.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Under acidic conditions, carbohydrates present in the biomass degrade into furfural or hydroxymethylfurfural, and the lignin degrades into a variety of phenolic compounds [<xref rid="pone.0194012.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In contrast, the Ammonia Fiber Expansion (AFEX<sup>TM</sup>) process produces many ammoniated compounds, which are significantly less inhibitory than their acid counterparts [<xref rid="pone.0194012.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0194012.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A previous comparison of AFEX and dilute acid treated corn stover showed that dilute acid pretreatment produces 316% more acidic compounds, 142% more aromatics, and 3555% more furans than AFEX, but no nitrogenous compounds [<xref rid="pone.0194012.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Notwithstanding the less toxic degradation products generated, the sugar utilization efficiency of ethanol production using ammonia-pretreated biomass still requires improvement. One major issue is the low xylose consumption rate during hexose/pentose co-fermentation, which largely results from pretreatment-derived biomass decomposition products, ethanol, and other fermentation metabolites [<xref rid="pone.0194012.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0194012.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, novel pretreatment technologies that further reduce toxic degradation products content in biomass were needed to minimize xylose utilization problems faced during yeast fermentation. Extractive-Ammonia (EA) is a newly developed pretreatment technology that selectively extracts lignin present in biomass. Compared to AFEX, EA uses higher ammonia-to-biomass loading and lower water loading, generates a separate lignin stream to extract up to 45% of the lignin from lignocellulosic, and removes most of the degradation products [<xref rid="pone.0194012.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus, EA-pretreated corn stover was found to have reduced lignin and degradation product content, enhanced digestibility of cellulose due to formation of cellulose III, and improved hydrolysate fermentability [<xref rid="pone.0194012.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>To study the inhibitory effects of degradation compounds, the DOE Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (GLBRC) has formulated a chemically-defined SynH to mimic real AFEX corn stover hydrolysate (ACSH) [<xref rid="pone.0194012.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Synthesized aromatic compounds were added into the control media based on ACSH composition analysis to better understand the complex inhibitory effects [<xref rid="pone.0194012.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0194012.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194012.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194012.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This artificial media has been proven helpful in testing the inhibitory effects of degradation compounds on engineered microbial strains. The aromatic compounds used in those studies, however, cannot fully represent the real ACSH due to the incomplete analysis of compounds present in ACSH, and different conformational isomers of synthesized compounds. Therefore, we explored an alternative method of producing SynH using naturally-derived compounds to better represent the inhibitory effects in ACSH. Also, microbial fermentation is done in aqueous media, so different water-soluble organic compounds and their relative concentrations will interact with microbes and influence their performance and viability.</p><p>In this study, water soluble components (WSC) were separated from crude lignin streams produced during EA pretreatment. These soluble compounds were added to base media to mimic real inhibitors in ACSH that affect microbial fermentation. Water extraction followed by ethyl acetate extraction were conducted successively to separate the WSC, especially the phenolic nitrogenous compounds in crude lignin stream obtained after EA pretreatment. Inhibition effect for WSC on yeast fermentation using SynH were observed. New inhibitors that were different from those known to be present in ACSH were identified using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC/GC-MS). Chemical genomics profiling was performed to further understand the gene response profile and metabolic pathways that are being inhibited by WSC in SynH. Gene deletion studies could help guide genetic engineering of yeasts to overcome inhibitory effects of lignocellulosic hydrolysates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Biomass</title><p>Corn stover used in this study was produced from corn (Pioneer 36H56) planted and harvested during 2010 at the Arlington Agricultural Research Station (Columbia County, WI).

In order to optimize the pretreatment processes for obtaining biomass and hydrolysates with higher digestibility and fermentability, respectively, and to engineer microbial strains for improved performance, it is critical to identify the major inhibitory compounds and better understand the mechanisms of inhibition that affect fermentative organisms. In this work, we used a synthetic hydrolysate (SynH) to study the inhibitory effects of water soluble compounds (WSC) isolated from the EA pretreatment crude lignin stream on yeast fermentation.</p><p>The natural lignin-derived compounds in WSC represent real inhibitory compounds that are present in ACSH. We found that the inhibitory effects of WSC increased at higher dosage levels, and SynH with 20 g/L WSC well mimicked real hydrolysates during yeast fermentation. Surprisingly, however, when the concentration of WSC reached 40 g/L, the inhibitory effects were reversed after 48 h, indicating that additional nutrients existed in WSC that manifested their effects at higher concentrations. To separate these effects and better understand this bimodal behaviour, ethyl acetate extraction was conducted to separate phenolic compounds from WSC. Major compounds identified in the organic phase of WSC included <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl amide, feruloyl amide and coumaroyl glycerol. These and other nitrogenous phenolic compounds act as key inhibitors in microbial fermentation of ACSH.</p><p>On the other hand, oligosaccharides and lipids were also identified in the water phase components following ethyl acetate extraction. These compounds improved cell growth and ethanol production after 48 h, thereby explaining the bimodal effects of WSC. Finally, chemical genomic profiling of WSC was conducted on a yeast deletion library to identify responsive genes. This work proved that EA pretreatment improved hydrolysate fermentability in part by removing highly toxic lignin-derived nitrogenous and phenolic compounds.</p><p>The fundamental knowledge gained in this study can be applied to characterize a variety of inhibitory compounds, optimize fermentation process, and design pretreatment process conditions. This improved basic understanding will also help develop yeast strains that can better tolerate degradation compounds present in pretreated biomass hydrolysate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0194012.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Composition analysis of different fractions of WSC.</title><p>(A).
