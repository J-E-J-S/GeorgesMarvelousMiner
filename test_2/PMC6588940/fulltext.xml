Previous evaluations of these biases have focused on adapter ligation bias with limited evaluation of reverse transcription bias or amplification bias. Furthermore, evaluations of the quantification of isomiRs (miRNA isoforms) or the influence of starting amount on performance have been very limited. No study had yet evaluated the quantification of isomiRs of altered length or compared the consistency of results derived from multiple moderate starting inputs. We therefore evaluated quantifications of miRNA and isomiRs using four library preparation kits, with various starting amounts, as well as quantifications following removal of duplicate reads using unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to mitigate reverse transcription and amplification biases.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">All methods resulted in false isomiR detection; however, the adapter-free method tested was especially prone to false isomiR detection. We demonstrate that using UMIs improves accuracy and we provide a guide for input amounts to improve consistency.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Our data show differences and limitations of current methods, thus raising concerns about the validity of quantification of miRNA and isomiRs across studies.

Small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) allows for detection of novel miRNAs and altered canonical miRNA sequences, termed isomiRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These miRNA isoforms are produced by many mechanisms, including shifts in Drosha and Dicer cleavage sites of the pri- and pre- miRNA sequence, as well as trimming by exoribonucleases, additions of bases by nucleotidyl transferases, and RNA editing by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. isomiRs show differences in stability, localization, and functionality. Some isoforms can even regulate alternative repertoires of mRNAs as compared to the canonical sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Recent research indicates that they are of clinical importance for many diseases and conditions, including cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and Huntington&#x02019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Despite the enhanced capability to detect such sequences, there has been little assessment of the quantification of isomiRs using sRNA-seq; and miRNA quantifications using this method are often inconsistent across studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This is likely in part due to differences between methods and/or variation in the detection by individual methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] (from library preparation to preprocessing to normalization, etc.). Furthermore, several aspects of sRNA-seq can lead to the preferential quantification of some miRNAs, while other miRNAs may be poorly detected or not detected at all, thus introducing biases that lead to misrepresentations of true miRNA expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Evaluations and comparisons of the accuracy (how close measurements are to the truth) and consistency (how close measurements are across replicates) associated with current methods are critical for proper cross-study interpretation and for guiding methodological improvement.</p><p id="Par21">Evidence suggests that biases and inconsistencies in sRNA-seq based quantifications and group comparisons are largely based on study design and library preparation methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The details of these issues have been reviewed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Some of these issues are avoidable with proper study design. However, bias and inconsistency related to adapter ligation, cDNA synthesis, and amplification may principally be dependent on library preparation and preprocessing methods, which are less readily controlled.</p><p id="Par22">A considerable number of studies have evaluated adapter ligation bias in quantifications from several commercially available kits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]; however, to our knowledge, only one study has directly compared the performance of randomized adapter methods and adapter ligation-free methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, limited studies have investigated the influence of reverse transcription or amplification bias in sRNA-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and no study to date has evaluated the use of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) in order to identify and remove duplicate reads to mitigate such biases in sRNA-seq biological samples. While amplification bias is associated with variations in sequence length and GC content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and while the use of UMIs has proven to be useful in mitigating amplification bias for traditional RNA sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and has become increasingly popular, the exact implementation of this method is still unresolved in the RNA sequencing field at large [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It remains unclear if UMIs would also be useful for small RNA sequencing as this has not been explored to date. The consensus in the field about PCR amplification bias in small RNA has been divided. One view holds that amplification bias appears to be minimal in sRNA-seq. They argue this because small RNA sequences are very similar in size, studies show that bias in sRNA-seq largely appears to be due to adapter ligation bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and studies show no distortion of quantification results with excessive numbers of PCR cycles compared to more reasonable numbers of cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, others suggest that amplification bias in sRNA-seq could also introduce bias as it does in traditional RNA sequencing (10), especially given the large range of GC content among miRNAs. While a couple of studies have used UMIs in sRNA-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], only one has evaluated the reproducibility of sRNA-seq quantifications obtained from utilizing UMIs to those without [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], in which the authors concluded that biological technical replicates had less variation when UMIs were used to remove duplicate reads compared to when either all or no duplicates were removed. However, no statistical tests were performed in this assessment, and no evaluation of the influence of the UMI deduplication on the accuracy of the quantifications was performed. In the sRNA-seq literature there has also been little assessment of the influence of starting amount on the consistency of quantifications. While RNA editing detection has been evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], other aspects of isomiR quantification have not yet been performed.</p><p id="Par23">To complete the gap left by previous studies, we comprehensively evaluated bias among miRNA and isomiR quantifications from four commercially available library preparation methods, as well as those obtained following the removal of duplicate reads using UMIs. We also evaluated the consistency of the results using a variety of starting amounts. We assessed the similarity of the quantifications from each method, the diversity of the detection of different types of small RNAs by each method, as well as the accuracy and the consistency of the results obtained from each method within and across batch. Such evaluations are critical for optimizing sRNA-seq methods to obtain both reliably consistent and accurate results across batches and studies, and to therefore allow for more accurate and reproducible miRNA and isomiR quantifications in disease states and conditions. Based on these results, we offer suggestions for future study designs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par24">In this study we evaluated the influence of several potential sources of bias and inconsistency on miRNA quantifications (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) by comparing the performance of four commercially available kits including two that are designed to mitigate adapter ligation bias in different ways (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) and two preprocessing methods including one to mitigate reverse transcription and adapter ligation bias and a control for comparison (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c), as well as various starting amounts (100&#x02009;ng to 2000&#x02009;ng) for each method to determine the reliability of results achieved with smaller inputs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). The following library preparation kits were compared: 1) the Clontech SMARTer smRNA-Seq Kit for Illumina, now owned by Takara Bio (Clontech), which incorporates adapter and index sequences during reverse transcription and amplification and is therefore ligase-free to avoid adapter ligation bias; 2) the Bioo Scientific NEXTflex Illumina Small RNA Sequencing Kit v3 (NEXTflex), now owned by Perkin Elmer and called NEXTFLEX, which utilizes adapter sequences with random nucleotide sequences adjacent to the miRNA binding location giving each miRNA a variety of adapter sequences to bind to avoid adapter ligation bias; 3) the Illumina TruSeq Small RNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina); and 4) the New England BioLabs Next Multiplex small RNA kit (NEB). Based on our literature search Illumina and NEB sRNA-seq kits appear to be the first and second most widely used kits to date, respectively. The NEB and the NEXTflex kits include polyethylene glycol in an effort to reduce adapter ligation bias by improving overall ligation efficiency.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study Design. <bold>a</bold> We evaluated the influence of starting amount on the consistency of results, as well as the accuracy of results obtained when using a variety of methods, including those intended to reduce bias from adapter ligation, reverse transcription (RT), and PCR amplification. <bold>b</bold> We compared four commercially available kits and two preprocessing methods to address RT and PCR bias. <bold>c</bold> In the Deduped method we collapsed duplicate reads based on a unique molecular identifier (UMI) of degenerate bases in the adapter sequences (bases within the black boxes). We also compared the collapsed data with a 5% subset of the NEXTflex data to determine if performance differences were due to the UMI-based collapsing of reads or simply due to having fewer reads. <bold>d</bold> We evaluated two data types: miRNA quantifications from homogenate whole brain total RNA and miRNA quantifications from a pool of 962 equimolar synthetic RNAs with sequences corresponding to human, rat, mouse, and virus miRNA. We had two batches of human brain data. The first included triplicates of different starting amounts based on the kit manufacturers&#x02019; suggested ranges. The second included a single sample of the same human brain with 1000&#x02009;ng of input.

These UMIs allow for the removal of duplicate reads introduced during amplification and possible mitigation for sequences that may have been preferentially reverse transcribed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). We will hereinafter refer to these data as &#x0201c;Deduped&#x0201d;. To determine if differences identified between the Deduped data and the NEXTflex data were simply due to a reduction in the number of reads (as the UMI-based deduplication process reduces the data down to 5% of the original), we also included a random 5% subset of the NEXTflex reads, hereinafter referred to as &#x0201c;Fivepercent,&#x0201d; for comparison.</p><p id="Par26">We evaluated two types of samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d-e) and processed the data following the methods outlined in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e.

Hierarchical cluster analysis indicated that the samples generally clustered by method and starting amount (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Differential analysis of the miRNA expression estimates revealed that the methods (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) produce overall relatively similar results, however some individual miRNAs showed very different quantifications with intensity ratios ranging as extreme as &#x02212;&#x02009;9 to 6 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Similarity Assessment. <bold>a</bold> Dendrogram depicting cluster analysis shows that samples largely cluster by method and starting amount. <bold>b</bold> MA plot demonstrating the difference between the miRNA quantifications by the various library preparation methods.

See the Similarity analysis section of the methods for more information. Thus the plot on the upper left corner shows the difference in quantification estimates between Clontech and Illumina for each miRNA quantified by both methods. We can see that some individual miRNAs greatly differ between the two methods across the full range of expression levels, as there is a difference of up to roughly 6 between the two methods for some miRNAs (with quantifications being much lower for the Clontech method relative to the Illumina method for these miRNAs), while the range of expression is roughly 6 to 18. As another example, the lower right plot shows the difference between the Deduped method and the Fivepercent method. Quantification estimates are quite similar, except for abundant miRNAs which show lower expression in the Deduped method, as one might expect. <bold>c</bold> The percent of variance explained by method, starting amount, batch, the number of reads mapped to miRNA, and the variance unaccounted for by these factors.

Thus, emphasizing only the most abundant miRNAs for further study may be problematic. The overlap between the most abundant miRNAs detected by Clontech and the other methods was lower (45 to 55%) than the overlap between Illumina, NEB, and NEXTflex (60&#x02013;65%). The Deduped method resulted in an 85% overlap with the raw NEXTflex data.</p><p id="Par29">Sum of squares analysis revealed that method choice was the largest contributor to miRNA count variability (on average 82% variance explained for individual miRNAs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c) when evaluating the data from all methods (excluding the Fivepercent control). This further exemplifies the lack of consistency in quantifications that may occur when different methods are utilized.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Accuracy</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>The reduction of numerous biases improves accuracy</title><p id="Par30">To assess the accuracy of each method (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f.Accuracy), we investigated how consistently each kit detected 962 equimolar synthetic miRNA sequences. We calculated the difference of each miRNA count from the mean count for all miRNAs for each method, which we called &#x0201c;accuracy error&#x0201d;. The six methods showed significant differences in accuracy (F&#x02009;=&#x02009;40.00, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2.2e-16). The Deduped data had significantly less accuracy error compared to all other methods (up to &#x02248; 8% less error), followed by comparable accuracy for Clontech, NEXTflex, and Fivepercent methods (which did not significantly differ from one another in post hoc analysis), and worse accuracy for the NEB and Illumina methods. This suggests that the Illumina and NEB methods detect different sequences with less validity than the other methods. This was expected, given the known adapter ligation bias associated with these methods. Our results suggest that the methods utilized by the Clontech and NEXTflex kits both diminish bias &#x02013; we speculate that this is due to a reduction in adapter ligation bias as compared to the Illumina and NEB methods. This is based on findings of previous evaluations of adapter ligation bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] demonstrating that randomized adapters, such as those used in the NEXTflex protocol, reduce adapter ligation bias and the fact that the Clontech method is adapter ligation free. However, mitigation of other forms of bias may also contribute to the improved accuracy. Using UMI sequences for deduping resulted in additional error reduction (the raw NEXTflex data had 2.81% more error) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a and Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2), which may be due to a reduction in reverse transcription and/or amplification bias. This is consistent with our analysis of the overall variance of the counts for these synthetic sequences (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). The concordance of the rank of the sequences with higher accuracy error across the methods was poor (data not shown), suggesting that different sequences were prone to bias for each of the methods<bold>.</bold><fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Accuracy Assessment. <bold>a</bold> Individual points represent the absolute difference of each synthetic miRNA quantification from the mean of all quantifications of the equimolar synthetic sequences for each small RNA sequencing method. <bold>b</bold> The variance of all the quantification estimates for the synthetic sequences. <bold>c</bold> The percent variance of synthetic sequence quantifications explained by each of these sequence characteristics: GC content, length, free energy of the predicted secondary structure (FoldG), identity of the first (5&#x02032;) and last (3&#x02032;) two bases, the count of individual bases, and the presence of repeat sequences, such as duplets of the same base or quadruplets of the same base.

The secondary structure free energy was highly influential for Clontech (explaining &#x02248; 7% of the variance), and the NEXTflex-based methods (explaining &#x02248; 10% of the variance for each). The identity of the last 2 bases was influential for all methods but in particular for the NEB and Illumina methods (explaining &#x02248; 6% of the variance for each), suggesting that adapter ligation of the 3&#x02032; end particularly introduces bias of miRNA quantifications, in agreement with previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The identity of the first 2 bases (5&#x02032;) was most influential for Clontech and explained &#x02248; 8% of the variance suggesting that the SMART template-switching of the 5&#x02032; end may introduce more bias. The number of Cs within a sequence also accounted for a relatively large percentage of the variance (2.5&#x02013;5% for all methods except for Clontech).

There was a significant difference in the number of isomiRs detected for each synthetic sequence by the methods (F&#x02009;=&#x02009;176.37, p-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2.2e-16).

On average the Clontech method resulted in 14 isomiRs per synthetic sequence, while the NEXTflex-based methods (the raw NEXTflex data, the Deduped, and the Fivepercent) resulted in roughly 2 isomiRs per synthetic sequence (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>i, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">12</xref>: Table S9).

We compared the NEXTflex kit with the Clontech kit which was also designed to mitigate adapter ligation bias, but by using an adapter ligation-free method. Only one prior study has compared the performance of these two kits using a previous and now discontinued version of the NEXTflex kit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], which demonstrated that the Clontech kit resulted in less bias, however, only 6 synthetic miRNAs were utilized in their accuracy assessment. A recent study that coincided with ours also found that these two kits perform similarly for accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. A similar UMI method is utilized by a recent library preparation kit by Qiagen. However, this kit was released after the data collection of our analysis. In addition, this kit, similarly to the NEB and Illumina kits, does not include methods to reduce adapter ligation bias, and the UMI is added after reverse transcription, which therefore does not allow for any reduction in bias associated with this step. The results of a recent study, which performed a similar analysis as ours, further suggest that the Qiagen kit has more bias and is less accurate than the Clontech and NEXTflex Kits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">To better assess the contributions of bias in the quantifications resulting from various library preparation designs, we have evaluated the quantifications from each method using a variety of metrics including: 1) Similarity &#x02013; how similar are the quantifications across methods (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f.Similarity); 2) Accuracy &#x02013; how well does each method equally quantify different equimolar miRNAs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f.Accuracy); 3) Detection diversity &#x02013; what capacity does each method have to capture a diverse range of unique small RNAs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f.Detection Diversity); and 4) Consistency &#x02013; how similar are results across batches, triplicates, and different starting inputs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f.Consistency).

More research is required to determine how to best utilize data derived from different sRNA-seq methods for mega- and meta-analyses. We also advise against further study of only the top expressed miRNAs from a single sRNA-seq study, particularly when a more biased method is utilized, as the top observed miRNAs may not be truly among the most abundant or influential, but instead those that are preferentially observed by the method. This issue has previously been discussed at length<sup>16</sup>. It is important to note that it remains unclear how relatively abundant a miRNA needs to be to exert biological importance in different contexts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Accuracy</title><p id="Par52">We suggest the use of a degenerate base method, such as NEXTflex or a ligation-free method, to improve accuracy. These methods appeared to equally improve accuracy, likely due to a reduction of adapter ligation bias (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a-b). We suggest that future small RNA studies utilize a UMI strategy, as our NEXTflex data preprocessed to account for UMI duplicates was even more accurate, reducing the overall variance of the log<sub>2</sub> transformed and normalized quantifications by 68%, or on average the difference from the mean for each miRNA by nearly 3% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a-b, Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). We speculate that our deduplication method led to such improvements due to reduced reverse transcription and/or amplification bias. Our sequence-specific analysis further indicated that secondary structure of miRNAs was one of the largest contributors to error of the Clontech and NEXTflex kits for the accuracy assessment, which appeared to be mitigated in the UMI deduped data for the NEXTflex kit (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c-d). This suggests that the secondary structure of miRNA sequences may be particularly influential for reverse transcription and/or amplification bias, in agreement with previous work that indicates that secondary structure can indeed influence reverse transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. More work is required to determine the extent that amplification or reverse transcription are particularly contributing to bias, and to what extent each are mitigated by the use of UMIs. Furthermore, it is unclear if the use of deduplication would improve other methods beyond the performance level of the current NEXTflex kit. However, the UMIs are inherently already included in the NEXTflex adapters, making this one of the best current options to mitigate bias in sRNA-seq.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Detection diversity</title><p id="Par53">All of the methods tested were capable of detecting a diverse range of miRNA sequences and there was a high degree of overlap in the identity of the miRNAs detected by each method (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c-e). Therefore, any of the tested methods may be appropriate for assessments about general miRNA diversity. However, the identity of miRNAs detected by Illumina varied greatly across batch, Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Table S5). We observed greater resolution for detection of a larger variety of miRNAs with greater sequencing depth. We did not evaluate depths above 20 million reads, so it remains unknown if even greater resolution can be achieved beyond this depth, however subsets of our 20 million depth data resulted in a reduction of diversity. We also observed that a more diverse pool was detected with larger input amounts; therefore, for the best diversity of detection, we recommend using the largest input possible.</p><p id="Par54">The Clontech kit resulted in the largest percentage of reads mapping to snoRNAs and snRNAs, while the NEXTflex kit resulted in the largest percentage of piRNA mapping reads (nearly 4.2 times higher than Clontech) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a-b, Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S4). Therefore, if these particular small RNAs are of interest, we would suggest the use of these two kits respectively. We did not evaluate the diversity of these other classes of small RNAs; however, given the results of our miRNA analysis, we predict that deeper sequencing will result in greater resolution of diversity.</p><p id="Par55">We especially suggest using randomized adapter methods, such as NEXTflex, for studies involving isomiR analysis. We suggest that all isomiR studies utilize an additional method for validation such as hairpin probe based RT-qPCR methods like dumbbell PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] or the two-tailed qPCR method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] or northern blot methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], as all the utilized RNA sequencing methods resulted in the observation of false isomiRs, this is particularly important for the methods that resulted in larger numbers of false isomiRs. We acknowledge that some observed isomiRs in the synthetic data may be due to errors in the synthesis of the synthetic miRNA pool, however the differences between the methods suggests that some methods may detect more false isomiR sequences due to improper adapters or other features of the library preparation. In particular, the Clontech method resulted in the highest level (on average 401% more than the other methods), thus we do not suggest that others utilize this method for studies that aim to evaluate isomiR expression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>h-j). Furthermore, because this method utilizes polyadenylation of the 3&#x02032; end, it is impossible to truly distinguish isomiRs that terminate with 3&#x02032; adenine bases. We speculate that some of the false isomiRs detected in the other methods may also result from PCR stutter, in which sequences with repeats or low entropy may experience deletions or expansions during PCR amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In all, the Deduped method resulted in the highest number of detected miRNAs with the lowest false isomiR detection (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>h-j). Therefore, of the tested methods, we suggest that the Deduped method may be the best for detecting the most diverse and reliable set of miRNAs. Further work is necessary to determine the potential sources that result in the detection of these false isomiRs and how this may influence the quantification of isomiRs in biological samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Consistency</title><p id="Par56">The Deduped method was also the most consistent for individual miRNA quantifications across triplicates within the same batch (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b) Therefore, we suggest the use of this method for optimal consistency. In general, we particularly caution against the use of Illumina when multiple batches of sequencing will be involved in a study, as this method resulted in significantly more inconsistent results across batches relative to all the other tested methods (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Table S5).</p><p id="Par57">An earlier analysis determined that detection consistency was poorer with much smaller starting amounts (10&#x02009;ng) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Agreeing with this, our results indicate that larger starting amounts for some methods may mitigate inconsistent quantifications of miRNAs and isomiRs.</p><p id="Par58">Overall, we observed the most consistent results across triplicates when utilizing 500&#x02009;ng or greater of starting input. In most cases, 500&#x02009;ng was sufficient, and no improvement was achieved with higher input amounts. However, the Deduped method performed best with at least 1000&#x02009;ng and the Clontech method resulted in similar levels of consistency despite the use of smaller inputs (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM15" ref-type="media">15</xref>: Table S12). Thus, if differing starting amounts or smaller starting amounts are required, and interest in isomiRs is limited, the Clontech method may be the best choice.</p><p id="Par59">Additional studies of UMI use for other library preparation methods and across biological samples are necessary to further understand the ability of UMIs to improve the consistency and reproducibility of sRNA-seq studies. Further work is also necessary to optimize the length of the UMI. In some cases, all UMIs will become saturated if a given small RNA is very highly expressed. Our calculations suggest that this UMI length is sufficient for the brain (using our current methods), in which miRNA make up a very small fraction of the total RNA and in which our data suggested that the most abundant miRNA represented only 11% of the miRNA reads. However longer UMIs may be required for tissues with greater enrichment of miRNAs or greater enrichment of other small RNAs of interest, where single RNAs may have more than 65,536 individual copies before amplification (see Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM16" ref-type="media">16</xref>: Note S1<bold>,</bold> which refers to Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM17" ref-type="media">17</xref>: Table S13).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par60">In conclusion, we observed significant differences in the accuracy, detection, and consistency of the various sRNA-seq methods tested suggesting that the methods differ in terms of bias contributed by adapter ligation, reverse transcription, and amplification. Our results underscore the importance of the library preparation methods and suggest that with moderately large starting amounts, the NEXTflex kit with deduplication may produce the least biased and most consistent results within and across studies. Our results suggest that bias is introduced in sRNA-seq due to reverse transcription and/or amplification and that the use of UMIs should be considered for further optimization to mitigate these biases in future sRNA-seq studies. Additional work is needed to decipher the role of these biases in sRNA-seq in order to guide more accurate sequencing methods. Further, and perhaps most noteworthy, our results indicate that all methods may result in false isomiR detection, stressing the importance of validation assessments for isomiR studies, and that the Clontech template switching method results in the detection of substantially more false isomiRs. Therefore, we advise caution with isomiR quantifications particularly when using this method and we suggest the use of RT-qPCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] or northern blot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] analysis for validation.

In this method, the adapters are ligated before reverse transcription and PCR amplification, therefore allowing for the estimation of the abundance of the sequences present in the sample before these steps. In the collapsed NEXTflex data referred to as &#x0201c;Deduped&#x0201d;, only reads that contained the same pair of a unique transcript with a unique UMI were maintained, while duplicate pairs were discarded. Therefore, each unique sequence had the opportunity to bind up to 65,536 different UMIs. As a control, we compared the performance of the Deduped data to a random 5% subset of the reads, referred to as &#x0201c;Fivepercent&#x0201d;. This was necessary as only 5% of the total reads remained following the collapsing method which required a preliminary alignment step.

However, we chose the widely used DESeq2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] method for normalization as this method assumes very few differences between samples and we expected little difference between the individual synthetic miRNAs, the replicates across batches, and the triplicates within a given batch given that the samples are biologically the same. Furthermore, we chose this method because plotting the raw data suggested that the various methods resulted in different miRNA compositions, with some miRNAs showing much higher abundance in some samples relative to others and this method not only normalizes for overall library size, but also normalizes for differences in composition or overall count dispersion of the samples by determining the ratio of the counts for a given gene/small RNA to the overall geometric mean of that transcript in all of the samples tested. The median of these ratios is then used to scale the count data for each sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Using this normalization method, we then determined which normalized expression estimates were greater than one for all 99 samples. This resulted in 151 common miRNAs above the threshold. We then log<sub>2</sub> transformed these estimates. We determined the distance between the samples using the hclust() function of the stats package (v 3.4.0). We also used these quantification estimates in a sum of squares analysis to determine the percent of variance explained by method, starting amount, batch, and the number of reads that mapped to miRNA. To do this we used the Anova() type II function of the CRAN car package(v 3.0&#x02013;0). To create the MA plots we used only the 1000&#x02009;ng brain samples from both batches (a total of 24 samples, 4 for each method). We again normalized this subset of samples using DESeq2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and the sRNA-seq method as the design. We again restricted our analysis to miRNAs with greater than one normalized count in all 24 samples. This resulted in 174 common miRNAs above the threshold. We then manually created the MA plots. We then ranked the log<sub>2</sub> normalized quantifications and determined the overlap of the most abundant miRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Accuracy assessment</title><p id="Par72">To perform the accuracy analyses, we used equimolar pools of 962 synthetic miRNAs purchased from Miltenyi Biotec.

The possible number of starting sequences for each miRNA was estimated assuming a PCR amplification efficiency of only 62.5%, all samples, thus enabling more conservative estimates for the number of starting sequences.
