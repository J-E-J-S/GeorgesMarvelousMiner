However, the low retention and engraftment of EPCs as well as the poor survival of migrated stem cells in ischemic tissues still hamper the successful clinical application. Thus, in this study, we engineered, for the first time, murine EPCs with synthetic mRNAs to transiently produce proangiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), stromal cell-derived factor-1&#x003b1; (SDF-1&#x003b1;), and angiopoietin-1 (ANG-1). After the transfection of cells with synthetic mRNAs, significantly increased VEGF-A, SDF-1&#x003b1;, and ANG-1 protein levels were detected compared to untreated EPCs. Thereby, mRNA-engineered EPCs showed significantly increased chemotactic activity versus untreated EPCs and resulted in significantly improved attraction of EPCs. Furthermore, ANG-1 mRNA-transfected EPCs displayed a strong wound-healing capacity. Already after 12&#x000a0;hr, 94% of the created wound area in the scratch assay was closed compared to approximately 45% by untreated EPCs. Moreover, the transfection of EPCs with ANG-1 or SDF-1&#x003b1; mRNA also significantly improved the <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> tube formation capacity; however, the strongest effect could be detected with EPCs simultaneously transfected with VEGF-A, SDF-1&#x003b1;, and ANG-1 mRNA. In the <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, EPCs transfected with ANG-1 mRNA revealed the strongest angiogenetic potential with significantly elevated vessel density and total vessel network length. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that EPCs can be successfully engineered with synthetic mRNAs encoding proangiogenic factors to improve their therapeutic angiogenetic potential in patients experiencing chronic or acute ischemic disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical Abstract</title><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>EPCs</kwd><kwd>ischemia</kwd><kwd>proangiogenic factors</kwd><kwd>synthetic mRNA</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">The insufficient perfusion of tissues or organs with blood results in ischemia and often leads to conditions such as stroke, myocardial infarction, or acute limb ischemia.

EPCs transfected with ANG-1 mRNA showed fastest closure of the wound area, with 94% already after 12&#x000a0;hr. In comparison, a wound closure area of about 45% was detected with EPCs treated only with medium and 38% with EPCs treated with the medium containing transfection reagent. After 24&#x000a0;hr, 100% of the wound area was closed in ANG-1 mRNA-transfected EPCs and 93% wound area was closed in SDF-1&#x003b1; mRNA-transfected EPCs. The closure of the wound area was significantly higher in these EPCs compared to the medium control. Especially, the transfection of EPCs with ANG-1 mRNA accelerated the migration process so that the wound area was completely closed already after 12&#x000a0;hr. In comparison, EPCs transfected with the mRNA cocktail showed significantly less wound closure area.

Especially, the production of ANG-1 protein was significantly reduced due to the increased mRNA amount in the triple mRNA cocktail-transfected cells. In eukaryotic cells, most secreted and membrane proteins undergo maturation steps in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> There, after the translation, nascent polypeptides are chemically modified and folded into mature proteins, and an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen can lead to an unfolded protein response (UPR) stress.
