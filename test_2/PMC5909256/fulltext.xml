DNA-seq data is often used as the primary source of mutational information while RNA-seq data is used to measure gene expression. Only in rare instances are DNA-seq and RNA-seq data analyzed together in an integrated fashion. However, there is an increasing recognition that integrated analysis of DNA-seq and RNA-seq data provides a more complete understanding of the molecular genetic state of the cells being studied. For example, integrated analysis of DNA-seq and RNA-seq data could be used to determine whether DNA variants are expressed, identify alterations in genomic DNA when altered DNA fragments escape hybrid capture in whole exome sequencing applications, or identify non-canonical RNA splicing events that are caused by underlying DNA alterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Although computational tools have been developed to detect single nucleotide variants, small indels (&#x0003c;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;bp), and structural variations (or gene fusions) from RNA-seq data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the field currently lacks an effective method to predict indels, especially for mid-sized and large indels, from RNA-seq data. Detecting indels in RNA-seq data is challenging for three reasons. First, RNA-seq aligners fail to map short reads which contain mid-sized insertions and large deletions, as these will be marked as splicing junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Second, existing indel callers were developed to predict indels from DNA-seq data, so utilization with RNA-seq data results in extremely high false positive rates of medium- and large-size indel calls due to inability to account for splicing events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Third, it is difficult to distinguish genomic indels from non-canonical splicing events, including microexons and exitrons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">To address this critical gap, we developed transIndel, an algorithm that flexibly detects indels from DNA-seq or RNA-seq data. TransIndel parses the chimeric alignments predicted by a short read aligner and reconstructs the mid-sized insertions and large deletions based on the linear alignments of split reads. When analyzing RNA-seq data, transIndel uses several filters to distinguish deletions with RNA splicing events. In this study, we validated the performance of transIndel for detection of small and large indels using simulated DNA-seq data and a 50&#x000d7; whole genome sequencing data set. We applied transIndel to large-scale prostate cancer DNA-seq and RNA-seq data sets and reported novel recurrent <italic>FOXA1</italic> indels and exitron splicing events.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Implementation</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The transIndel pipeline</title><p id="Par17">TransIndel is intended for paired-end or single-end read data with reads of at least 75&#x000a0;bp. It takes aligned short read data in BAM format as input. The alignment is performed by BWA-MEM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] for either DNA-seq or RNA-seq as this aligner supports soft clipping at the 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; end of reads and reports chimeric alignments with an &#x02018;SA&#x02019; tag in the alignment records. The aligned reads are then passed through a series of processing stages. 1) Preprocessing: the input BAM is parsed and multiple quality filters are applied, including removal of multi-mapped reads (indicated by an &#x0201c;XA&#x0201d; tag in their BAM records), low-quality (MAPQ in the BAM record is less than a user specified cutoff, 60 by default) and secondary alignments (flagged by 0&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100 in their BAM records). 2) Extracting reads: the chimeric reads are extracted if a) they are labeled with an &#x0201c;SA&#x0201d; tag; b) there is only one alternative hit reported as part of this chimeric alignment and c) mapping quality of this alternative hit exceed a user specified cutoff (60 by default). 3) Classifying linear alignments: each of the two linear alignments in a chimeric alignment is classified into one of the three types based on their CIGAR strings: left part mapped but right part soft clipped, left part soft clipped but right part mapped and others. 4) Indel reconstruction: an indel is detected based on the chromosome, location, strand and type of the two linear alignments in a chimeric alignment and the CIGAR string of this chimeric alignment is redefined as a linear alignment which has included the inferred indel event. Details are described in the section &#x0201c;Indel reconstruction.&#x0201d; After those steps, a new BAM file with a corrected CIGAR string is generated. The indels are detected at nucleotide sites using SAMtools pileup function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] implemented by a Python module called pysam (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pysam.readthedocs.io">http://pysam.readthedocs.io</ext-link>/). When calling the indels at each loci from the newly created BAM file, we only utilize reads with mapping quality score&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;15 and require at least 2 reads to support the variant allele. The identified indels are finally reported in VCF format. However, the output BAM file from transIndel can be passed into an existing variant caller such as VarDict [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] for germline or somatic indel calling as well. In our analyses of TCGA data, we used VarDict to estimate the VAF of <italic>FOXA1</italic> indels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Indel reconstruction</title><p id="Par18">Here we named the types of linear alignments as MS, SM, and O where MS stands for the alignments whose left part mapped but right part soft clipped (e.g. 40M60S as the CIGAR string); SM stands for the alignments whose right part mapped but left part soft clipped (e.g. 40S60M as the CIGAR string) and O stands for the alignments that were not included in the MS or SM class.

Reads with small indels can be represented as a single linear alignment to the reference genome and hence can be used to detect indels from the direct evidence of the alignment by available indel callers. However, as the indel size increases, short read aligners such as STAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] fail to map reads with those indels linearly in a single record. Instead, it detects large deletions as splicing junctions (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1a). Conversely, a chimera-aware aligner such as BWA-MEM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] aligns short reads in a chimeric alignment, which consists of two linear alignments with each of the hits marked by soft-clipping in the alignment file that may account for half of the soft-clipped reads (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1b). By leveraging the alignment details for those chimeric reads, it is possible to reconstruct the linear alignment with mid-sized insertions and large deletions from the initial short read alignment and provide a redefined alignment output for downstream indel detection.</p><p id="Par29">First, transIndel searches chimeric alignments from BAM files generated by BWA-MEM and selects those containing two linear alignments that do not have large overlaps but align on the same chromosome and strand. Second, the type and size of indels are determined by comparing the differences between target offset and read length (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In the case of deletions, the target offset is larger than the read length. In cases of mid-sized novel sequence insertions or tandem duplications, the target offset is shorter than the read length.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Validation on synthetic and real data</title><p id="Par30">We compared the performance of transIndel with seven existing indel detection algorithms (GATK HaplotypeCaller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], Pindel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], Scalpel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], Platypus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], Fermikit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], Delly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and NovoBreak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]) on a synthetic data set.

For example, a 3433&#x000a0;bp deletion from site A of patient C-6 had a 30% VAF but estimated as 47% by SHEAR originally. Since SAMTools directly used chimeric reads with recovered indels to calculate the VAF which may only account for partial variant depth, it was likely to underestimate the VAF. To make the prediction more accurate, we applied VarDict to predict the VAF of this deletion. VarDict enables accurate estimation of the VAF for indels by performing supervised and unsupervised local realignment of soft-clipped reads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

Since existing algorithms can reliably detect SNVs and small indels less than 10&#x000a0;bp (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2), we focused on indels equal to or larger than 10&#x000a0;bp.

We noted that the size of deletions initially called by transIndel varied significantly, with many falling into the structural variation category scale, rather than the indel scale. We therefore further limited our study to indels that were contained within a single gene only. With these filtering thresholds, we detected 1043 somatic indels in PC and 2034 somatic indels in mCRPC. The size range of deletions observed in PC and mCRPC were 10 to 27,293&#x000a0;bp and 10 to 113,612&#x000a0;bp, respectively and the size range of insertions in PC and mCRPC were 10 to 66&#x000a0;bp and 10 to 85&#x000a0;bp, respectively.

RNA-seq raw reads were aligned with BWA-MEM and transIndel was used to infer candidate indels. Deletion candidates were subjected to several filters to discriminate genomic deletions from RNA splicing events, including removal of deletions neighboring canonical splicing motifs or annotated splice sites (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). This pipeline identified genomic deletions that were misclassified as splicing junctions (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Figure S4a-d) and genomic insertions that were missed (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Figure S4e-h) by the STAR algorithm, which is a component of GATK best practice for indel discovery in RNA-seq (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/best-practices/rnaseq.php">https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/best-practices/rnaseq.php</ext-link>).

This situation likely occurred because the exome capture kits used for WES are primarily designed to capture the protein-coding regions in the genome (~&#x02009;2% of human genome), whereas RNA-seq also covers UTRs and retained introns in the transcriptome (~&#x02009;5% of human genome) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

To investigate the reasons for this low degree of overlap, we examined differences in WES and RNA-seq read coverage at locations corresponding to the 2034 WES indels (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Figure S6a) and 6734 RNA-seq indels (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Figure S6b). These results indicated that coverage difference between WES and RNA-seq at the locations of predicted indels was the main reason for this low overlap in indel calls.</p><p id="Par37">As anticipated, the fraction of indels in coding exons was markedly higher in the overlap between WES and RNA-seq than in either dataset alone (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). Interestingly, the VAFs of the 71 common indels called from WES and RNA-seq data showed weak correlation (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.31;<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0079). Linear regression analysis indicated that indels called from RNA-seq data were present at higher VAF than those same indels called from WES data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). This is likely due to inefficient hybridization-based capture of DNA fragments harboring medium- to large-scale indels, which is a standard step in WES workflows. An example of this scenario is shown for <italic>FOXA1</italic> in Figure S7 (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>). We found the WES didn&#x02019;t cover FOXA1 well between aa240&#x02013;380, which might prevent detecting additional FOXA1 mutations<bold>.</bold> These results suggest that detection of indels in RNA-seq data using transIndel could complement WES for detection and validation of genomic alterations, which is crucial for clinical diagnostics.</p><p id="Par38">Since WES and RNA-seq data are both expected to display enrichment in exonic regions, we focused on the indels discovered in coding exons. Surprisingly, we found only 12 coding indels called from WES data that overlapped with coding indels called from RNA-seq data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Explanations for this surprisingly low overlap could be that the genes impacted by indels were not expressed (RPKM &#x0003c;&#x02009;1), or gene expression was arising from the unaffected, reference allele (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Overall, there were more coding indels called from RNA-seq data. In several instances, manual inspection of WES data indicated the presence of individual DNA-seq reads supporting these indel events. However, these would have ultimately been filtered out in the DNA-seq indel calling pipeline due to low coverage (&#x0003c;&#x02009;10&#x000d7;). Conversely, many coding indels called from RNA-seq data appeared to be RNA-only events, as there was no evidence of corresponding DNA-levels events despite high WES coverage in these regions. One explanation for this phenomenon could be a type of non-canonical splicing event, termed exonic introns (exitron) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. One of the distinguishing features of exitrons is overrepresentation of indel sizes that are multiples of three nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Indeed, by comparing the size distribution of detected exitron events with all RNA-seq indels, we found that exitron events were enriched for indels with sizes that were multiples of three (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>: Figure S8).</p><p id="Par39">Although the transIndel pipeline for indel detection from RNA-seq data included the removal of deletions that could be splicing junctions, the catalog of alternative splicing events in prostate cancer, including exitrons, is incomplete. Remarkably, many of the detected exitrons were recurrent within genes known to be altered at high frequency in cancer (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). Over half of the cancer genes displaying non-canonical exitron splicing were known tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). We also found that <italic>KMT2B</italic>, a known regulator of mCRPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], displayed exitron splicing in 7% of mCRPC samples. To test the accuracy of these RNA-level calls, we assessed their presence in the LNCaP cell line by analyzing LNCaP WES and RNA-seq data using transIndel. LNCaP cells displayed evidence for exitron splicing in <italic>ZBTB18</italic>, which was the most frequent exitron splicing events observed in mCRPC specimens. We performed RT-PCR with LNCaP RNA and PCR with LNCaP DNA, and confirmed by Sanger sequencing that <italic>ZBTB18</italic> displayed bona fide exitron splicing at the RNA level only (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). <italic>ZBTB18</italic> encodes a transcriptional repressor involved in neural development. It has been reported as a possible tumor suppressor as its expression reduces cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Additionally, it has been reported that the <italic>ZBTB18</italic> exitron splicing expressed in both <italic>ERBB2</italic>-positive breast cancer and normal breast tissues, but it has higher percent of spliced in value in tumor compared with normal samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par40">Herein, we have devised transIndel, a computational approach that allows the accurate identification of indels from DNA-seq or RNA-seq. TransIndel is able to call small indels from normal alignments and reconstruct large deletions and mid-sized insertions from chimeric alignments. When applied to RNA-seq data, transIndel carries out subsequent filtering that accounts for annotated RNA splicing events. By analyzing whole exome DNA-seq data in TCGA and SU2C cohorts, we demonstrated that transIndel is highly sensitive for discovering mid-sized and large indels that were missed by these original studies. Applying transIndel to RNA-seq data allowed us to validate expression of indels detected from DNA-seq and discover large indels that were missed by DNA-seq due to inefficient capture of DNA fragments harboring these indels.</p><p id="Par41">One major improvement of transIndel compared with other indel callers is the ability to infer indels directly from the initial alignment given by the short read aligner. Most of the existing indel detect methods, such as Pindel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and ScanIndel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], rely on an ad hoc step for realigning split reads to determine whether those reads support an indel event or not. These realignment steps are carried out either by a third-party aligner (e.g. BLAT used by ScanIndel) or internal realignment algorithms (e.g. pattern growth algorithms used by Pindel). Although these realignment steps can help identify indels that are not marked by the initial alignment, they significantly increase the running time of those tools. We realize that although there is not hard evidence for the existence of indels within Compact Idiosyncratic Gapped Alignment Report (CIGAR) strings, chimeric alignments provide sufficient information to directly identify an indel event by comparing the read length and the target offset calculated from the split linear alignments in the chimeric alignment. Our benchmarks using synthetic and real data have demonstrated that transIndel exhibited competitive performance with the tools using realignment strategies for mid-sized and large indel detection. The major advance achieved by eliminating this realignment step is that transIndel can analyze RNA-seq alignment data, which possess enormous numbers of split reads due to splicing, in a reasonable running time.</p><p id="Par42">RNA-seq data has been used traditionally for measuring gene expression levels, and identifying novel splicing isoforms, non-coding RNAs, and gene fusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Recently, RNA-seq data has been utilized to validate the expression of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) identified from DNA-seq data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. To our knowledge, transIndel is the first algorithm to enable evaluation of expressed mid-sized and large indels in RNA-seq data. We found that inclusion of RNA-seq data in indel discovery strategies greatly increased sensitivity for detecting indels in prostate cancer. This work complements a previous report focusing on detection of point mutations and small indels, which also found that analysis of RNA-data enhanced discovery of these variants over analysis of DNA-seq data alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">Currently, existing tools for detection of SNVs from RNA-seq data require integrated analysis of DNA-seq data with the intent of balancing sensitivity and specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. TransIndel is capable of detecting indels from RNA-seq alone. This is expected to greatly enhance the usability of RNA-seq data, as transIndel would enable analysis of the large numbers of samples that have been analyzed by RNA-seq for which matched DNA-seq data are not available. However, one caveat noted in our study is that transIndel annotates non-canonical exitron splicing as deletions if DNA-seq is not available for validation.</p><p id="Par44">Overall, our work demonstrates the feasibility of indel calling from RNA-seq data with high sensitivity and specificity. Recently, it has become more common for clinical testing pipelines to employ both whole exome DNA-seq and RNA-seq analyses.
