To test the performance of this pipeline, we made use of single-cell brain methylomes to create synthetic methylomes of known cell composition. Compared with highly variable CpG sites, pCSM loci achieved a higher prediction accuracy in the virtual methylome dissection of synthetic methylomes.

As the gold standard for methylation detection, bisulfite sequencing has been widely used to generate genome-wide methylation data and computational efforts have been made to meet the statistical challenges in mapping bisulfite-converted reads and determining differentially methylated sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Methylation data analysis has been extended from simple comparisons of methylation levels to more sophisticated interpretations of methylation patterns embedded in sequencing reads, which are referred to as the combinatory methylation statuses of multiple neighboring CpG sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Through multiple bisulfite sequencing reads mapped to a given genome locus, methylation entropy can be calculated as a measurement of the randomness, specifically the variations, of DNA methylation patterns in a cell population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It was soon realized that such variations in methylation patterns could have resulted from methylation differences: (1) among different types of cells in a mixed cell population, (2) between the maternal and paternal alleles within a cell, or (3) between the CpG sites on the top and bottom DNA strands within a DNA molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The genome-wide hairpin bisulfite sequencing technique was developed to determine strand-specific DNA methylation, i.e., methylation patterns resulting from (3). The methylation difference between two DNA strands is high in embryonic stem cell (ESC) but low in differentiated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For instance, in human brain, the chances of four neighboring CpG sites having an asymmetric DNA methylation pattern in a double-stranded DNA molecule are less than 0.02% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Allelic DNA methylation, i.e., methylation patterns resulting from (2), was found to be limited in a small set of CpG sites. In the mouse genome, approximately two thousand CpG sites were found to be associated with allele-specific DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Thus, cellular heterogeneity could be a primary source of the variations in DNA methylation patterns. This often leads to bipolar methylation patterns, meaning that genome loci are covered both with completely methylated reads and completely unmethylated reads simultaneously in bulk methylomes. Such bipolar methylated loci can be detected using nonparametric Bayesian clustering followed by hypothesis testing and were found to be highly consistent with the differentially methylated regions identified among purified cell subsets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. For this reason, these loci are called the putative cell-type-specific methylated (pCSM) loci. They were further demonstrated to exhibit methylation variation across single-cell methylomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">An appropriate interpretation of methylome data derived from bulk tissues requires consideration of methylation variations contributed by diverse cellular compositions. With the existing reference methylomes for different types of cells, it is possible to estimate cell ratios in a heterogeneous population with known information about the cell types. For instance, cell mixture distributions within peripheral blood can be assessed using constrained projection, which adopts least-squares multivariate regression to estimate regression coefficients as the ratios for cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. More recent studies suggest that non-constrained reference-based methods are robust across a range of different tissue types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and Bayesian semi-supervised methods may construct cell-type components in a way that each component corresponds to a single-cell type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For reference-based algorithms, prior knowledge of cell composition and cell-specific methylation markers is critical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To overcome these issues, principal component analysis (PCA) was adopted by ReFACTor for the correction of cell-type heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) was adopted by MeDeCom to recover cell-type-specific latent methylation components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, the performance of such reference-free cell-type deconvolution tools relies heavily on model assumptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Recently, the development of single-cell DNA methylation sequencing techniques generated a growing number of methylomes at unprecedented resolution, providing new opportunities to explore cellular diversity within cell populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]; yet, no attempt has been taken to make use of single-cell methylomes for cell-type deconvolution analysis.</p><p id="Par7">In this study, we propose a semi-reference-free, NMF-based pipeline to dissect cell-type compositions for methylomes generated from bulk tissues. This pipeline takes advantage of pCSM segments that exhibit bipolar methylation patterns in methylomes generated from bulk tissues or among single-cell methylomes. To overcome the shallow depth of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was modified to cluster pCSM loci. PCA was performed to select eigen-pCSM loci, which are representative loci for clusters of pCSM loci. To evaluate the performance of eigen-pCSM loci selected in cell-type deconvolution, over 3000 brain single-cell methylomes were mixed in random proportions in simulation studies to create synthetic methylomes. The pipeline implemented in this study provides an accurate estimation of cell-type composition on both synthetic methylomes and bulk methylomes from five neuronal cell populations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Virtual methylome dissection based on eigen-pCSM loci</title><p id="Par8">To perform virtual methylome dissection, we introduced a three-step pipeline (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In the first step, pCSM loci were determined for target methylomes, which were generated from various sources including tissues, sorted cells, or single cells. The key issue in this step was to efficiently distinguish cell-type-specific DNA methylation events from stochastic methylation events. Using the hairpin bisulfite sequencing approach, we observed that 5% of CpG sites were asymmetrically methylated, but the frequencies of asymmetric methylation events decreased more than 200 times from approximately 5% for a single CpG to 0.02% for a sliding window of a 4-CpG genomic segment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore, in our proposed pipeline, the methylation patterns of 4-CpG genomic segments were determined from each bisulfite-converted sequencing read to minimize the influence of asymmetric DNA methylation. For all 4-CpG segments mapped to a given genomic loci, the variation in their methylation patterns was subjected to nonparametric Bayesian clustering followed by hypothesis testing to infer bipolar methylated loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. After the filtering of allelic-specific methylated regions and merging overlapping segments, pCSM loci were collected for co-methylation analysis. In the second step, eigen-pCSM loci, representing pCSM clusters with distinct methylation profiles, were determined by WGCNA clustering and PCA analysis. In the third step, target methylomes were decomposed with eigen-pCSM loci using the NMF algorithm. The methylation matrix of eigen-pCSM loci in all samples was decomposed into a product with two matrices: one for the methylation profiles of estimated cell types and the other for the cell-type proportions across all samples.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>A three-step process to perform methylome dissection using eigen-pCSM loci. <bold>a</bold> In the first step, bipolar 4-CG segments are identified and a nonparametric Bayesian clustering algorithm is used for the determination of pCSM loci. <bold>b</bold> In the second step, co-methylation analysis is performed by <italic>k</italic>-means clustering coupled with WGCNA analysis.

</p><p id="Par9">Mammalian brain consists of many functionally distinct cell subsets that can contribute to diverse DNA methylation patterns on loci with cell subset-specific methylation. In particular, diverse subpopulations of neurons and glial cells can often be found even within a given brain region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our procedure, we performed two distinct analyses using synthetic methylomes derived from brain single cells and methylomes from brain-sorted cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>pCSM loci predicted with brain single-cell methylomes</title><p id="Par10">Our first case study took advantage of recent brain single-cell methylomes generated for 3377 neurons derived from mouse frontal cortex tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Following our previous procedure for single-cell methylome analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], we determined the pCSM loci from each single-cell methylome. Briefly, for each methylome, we scanned the sequence reads one by one to identify genomic segments with methylation data for four neighboring CpG sites. To facilitate pCSM identification from the 4,326,935 4-CG segments identified, we first selected 1,070,952 pCSM candidates that were completely methylated in at least one neuron but also completely unmethylated in another. We next applied the beta mixture model to the methylation patterns in single neurons for these candidates segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. 921,565 segments were determined to be pCSM segments with bipolar distributed methylation profiles, while the rest (149,387 segments) had heterogeneous methylation patterns among neurons.</p><p id="Par11">To gain a better understanding of pCSM, we analyzed several features of these 921,565 pCSM segments using the leftover 3,405,370 non-CSM segments from the starting 4,326,935 segments as controls. According to the methylation status of each 4-CG segment, we assigned the neurons into two subsets, hypermethylated and hypomethylated, and calculated the methylation difference of each 4-CG segment between the two cell subsets. For non-CSM segments with all methylated reads or unmethylated reads, only one cell subset could be identified, and thus, the methylation difference was set as zero. As expected, pCSM segments showed large methylation differences between the two cell subsets with an average of 0.70, while the average methylation difference for non-CSM segments was only 0.11 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The average methylation levels of pCSM segments among cells were broadly distributed, while the non-CSM segments tended to be either hypermethylated or hypomethylated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Some pCSM segments had average methylation levels approaching 1 or 0, but their bipolar methylation patterns allowed the splitting of cells into two groups with a methylation difference close to 1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). In contrast, the majority of either hypermethylated or hypomethylated non-CSM segment cells split into two groups with a methylation difference less than 0.2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>pCSM segments reflected methylation heterogeneity. <bold>a</bold> Distribution of methylation differences between cell subsets classified with pCSM and non-CSM segments. <bold>b</bold> Average methylation levels of pCSM segments and non-CSM segments across single cells. <bold>c</bold>, <bold>d</bold> Relationship between methylation level and methylation difference of pCSM segments (<bold>c</bold>) and non-CSM segments (<bold>d</bold>).

</p><p id="Par12">To further explore the functional characteristics of pCSM segments, we merged the overlapped pCSM segments into 347,889 loci (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2) and integrated them with brain histone modification maps. We observed that these pCSM loci were enriched at H3K27ac, H3K4me, and H3K4me3 peaks and CpG islands with 1.63-, 1.93-, 1.28-, and 1.52-fold increases, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e). In addition, pCSM loci were depleted from repeat regions including SINE, LINE, and LTR. This result suggested that pCSM loci might play important regulatory roles in the brain. For the pCSM loci that overlapped with histone marks for enhancers or promoters, we identified their adjacent genes for functional enrichment analysis using the GREAT analysis tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. As shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S1, genes associated with these pCSM loci are significantly enriched in the functional categories for brain development, such as &#x0201c;regulation of synaptic plasticity&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;metencephalon development.&#x0201d; Altogether, these results indicate that pCSM loci showing bipolar methylation among neurons may play important roles in the epigenetic regulation of brain development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Synthetic methylome: eigen-pCSM loci determination and virtual methylome dissection by NMF</title><p id="Par13">In the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], a total of 3377 neurons were clustered into 16 neuronal cell types including mL2.3, mL4, mL5.1, mL5.2, mL6.1, mL6.2, mDL.1, mDL.2, mDL.3, and mIn.1 for excitatory neurons and mVip, mPv, mSst.1, mSst.2, mNdnf.1, and mNdnf.2 for inhibitory neurons. Such single-cell methylomes with assigned cell-type information provide ideal training and test sets to examine our approach. By merging single-cell methylomes within each cluster, we first created 16 artificial methylomes as references for distinct cell types. These 16 reference methylomes were then mixed in random proportions to create synthetic methylomes. To overcome the low read depth at each genomic locus, we performed clustering analysis to extract eigen-pCSM loci from the synthetic methylomes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). To identify co-methylated modules, we collected a total of 61 mouse methylomes across all brain development stages and cell types (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1).

Corresponding to the decomposed cell types, the proportions of cell types predicted with NMF were also accurately reproduced (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e) with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.037, which serves as a measure for the precision of the proportions of LMCs predicted by NMF. A high level of Pearson&#x02019;s correlations with a range from 0.82 to 1.00 was observed between the 12 immediately grouped reference neuronal types (i.e., mL5.1, mL4, mDL.1, mL2.3, mDL.2, mL6.1, mL6.2, mL5.2, mVip, mNdnf.2, mPv, and mSst.1) and the predicted cell types (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2B). The other four types of neuronal cells, including mDL.3, mIn.1, mNdnf.1, and mSst.2, were not decomposed from synthetic methylomes. The percentages of these four types of neurons only account for a small fraction (&#x0003c;&#x02009;1.7%) of the 3377 neurons sequenced (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2C). The mapped reads for these four types were very limited (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2D). Thus, the methylation features of these four types may not be fully represented by the small number of pCSM loci identified (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2E). Since the proportions of the 16 cell types followed a uniform distribution in the simulation study (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2F), the failure in cell component decomposition is likely due to insufficient information in the eigen-pCSM loci to distinguish these four types of neurons from the others. This indicates that our procedure could have a detection limit for the rare cells. Another possibility is that some of the components had the unidentified cell types as their second-best matches. Therefore, missing just a few population-specific loci, e.g., due to poor coverage, could be the reason behind this loss of identifiability.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Virtual methylome dissection based on eigen-pCSM loci. <bold>a</bold> Methylation profiles of eigen-pCSM loci, with each row representing an eigen-pCSM locus and each column representing one synthetic methylome. <bold>b</bold> Methylation profiles of NMF predicted cell types, with each row representing an eigen-pCSM loci and each column representing an NMF predicted cell type. <bold>c</bold> Heatmap of cell proportions predicted with NMF across all samples, with each row representing an NMF predicted cell type and each column representing a sample.

These five methylomes were analyzed separately and together as a mixed pool (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3A). 19,091 to 212,218 pCSM segments were identified in the six methylomes, accordingly. Among the 212,218 pCSM segments identified in the mixed pool, 118,409 segments showed differential DNA methylation states across the five neuronal samples; the other 93,809 pCSM segments were found to be pCSM segments within the five methylomes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3B). Since a significant number of pCSM segments can be identified from pooled samples to capture differences among sorted cells (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3B), it is a better strategy to pool methylomes from sorted cells for pCSM loci identification, particularly when methylomes have a low read depth.</p><p id="Par17">Next, we asked whether the pCSM segments identified from the pooled methylome could reflect the cell-type-specific methylation pattern derived from single-cell methylomes. Interestingly, we found that the pCSM segments identified from the pooled methylome were significantly overlapped with those identified using single-cell methylomes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3C). This indicates that the cell-type-specific methylated loci determined with single-cell methylomes could also be detected using a bulk methylome. In addition, pCSM loci identified from the pooled methylome (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S3) were enriched at enhancer histone markers and CpG islands, but were depleted from promoter, 5&#x02032;UTR, and repeat elements (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3D).</p><p id="Par18">To further explore the composition of the five neuronal cell populations, we performed methylome virtual dissection based on pCSM loci identified from the pooled methylome. Following the aforementioned procedure, we performed co-methylation analysis and extracted eigen-pCSM loci from each module. An NMF model was performed with 20,000 eigen-pCSM loci selected to decompose the five methylomes. The cross-validation error showed a substantial change at <italic>k&#x02009;</italic>&#x02265;&#x02009;3 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a), which indicated the existence of at least three major epigenetically distinct cell components, i.e., LMCs. We then examined the factorization results and compared the three main LMCs at <italic>k&#x02009;</italic>=&#x02009;3 and <italic>&#x003bb;&#x02009;</italic>=&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> to the single-cell reference profiles. Clustering analysis showed that the reference profiles of EXC, PV, and VIP neurons are related to LMC1, LMC3, and LMC2, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). In addition, we found that the samples of EXC, PV, and VIP neurons have high purity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c). Although the cellular composition of NeuN+&#x02009;cells is unknown and depends highly on the cell sorting procedure, about 70&#x02013;85% of mouse cortical neurons are excitatory with 6&#x02013;12% PV neurons and 1.8&#x02013;3.6% VIP neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In our study, the 7-week NeuN+&#x02009;sample was predicted to have a mixture of 94.73% excitatory neurons, 4.35% PV neurons, and 0.92% VIP neurons. The 12-month NeuN+&#x02009;sample was predicted to consist of 88.98% excitatory neurons, 7.6% PV neurons, and 3.42% VIP neurons. Considering the fact that inhibitory neurons have been reported as more likely to be depleted during the NeuN sorting procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], our predictions were largely consistent with the known composition of mouse cortical neurons. Altogether, these results indicate that pCSM loci may serve as excellent predictors to decompose bulk methylomes.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Methylome virtual dissection of five neuronal sorted cell populations. <bold>a</bold> Selection of parameters <italic>k</italic> and <italic>&#x003bb;</italic> by cross-validation provided by MeDeCom Package. <bold>b</bold> Clustering analysis of predicted cell types and reference cell types when <italic>k</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3, with the red nodes representing the predicted cell types and the blue nodes representing the reference cell types from single-cell methylomes. <bold>c</bold> Predicted proportions of each LMC in five datasets</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13072_2019_310_Fig6_HTML" id="MO6"/></fig>

Application of synthetic methylomes that are simulated based on single-cell methylomes and methylomes derived from sorted cells demonstrated that our approach is efficient and has high prediction accuracy. Our procedure is semi-reference free. The clustering of pCSM loci to identify representative eigen-pCSM loci depends on the methylomes collected.
