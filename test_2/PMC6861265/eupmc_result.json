    "Alveolar epithelial injury induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and abnormal collagen production by activated fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) is involved in the onset and exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Compared with alveolar epithelial cells, lung fibroblasts, especially myofibroblasts, exhibit an apoptosis-resistance phenotype (apoptosis paradox) that appears to be involved in IPF pathogenesis. Thus, we screened for chemicals eliciting preferential cytotoxicity of LL29 cells (lung fibroblasts from an IPF patient) compared with A549 cells (human lung alveolar epithelial cell line) from medicines already in clinical use. We identified idebenone, a synthetic analogue of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10, an antioxidant) that has been used clinically as a brain metabolic stimulant. Idebenone induced cell growth inhibition and cell death in LL29 cells at a lower concentration than in A549 cells, a feature that was not observed for other antioxidant molecules (such as CoQ10) and two IPF drugs (pirfenidone and nintedanib). Administration of idebenone prevented bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and increased pulmonary ROS levels. Importantly, idebenone also improved pulmonary fibrosis and lung function when administered after the development of fibrosis, whereas administration of CoQ10 similarly prevented bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, but had no effect after its development. Administration of idebenone, but not CoQ10, suppressed bleomycin-induced increases in lung myofibroblasts. In vitro, treatment of LL29 cells with idebenone, but not CoQ10, suppressed TGF-Î²-induced collagen production. These results suggest that in addition to antioxidant activity, idebenone exerts inhibitory activity on the function of lung fibroblasts, with the former activity being preventative and the latter therapeutic for bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Thus, we propose that idebenone may be more therapeutically beneficial for IPF patients than current treatments."
