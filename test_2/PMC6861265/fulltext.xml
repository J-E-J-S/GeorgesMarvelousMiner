Compared with alveolar epithelial cells, lung fibroblasts, especially myofibroblasts, exhibit an apoptosis-resistance phenotype (apoptosis paradox) that appears to be involved in IPF pathogenesis. Thus, we screened for chemicals eliciting preferential cytotoxicity of LL29 cells (lung fibroblasts from an IPF patient) compared with A549 cells (human lung alveolar epithelial cell line) from medicines already in clinical use. We identified idebenone, a synthetic analogue of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ<sub>10</sub>, an antioxidant) that has been used clinically as a brain metabolic stimulant. Idebenone induced cell growth inhibition and cell death in LL29 cells at a lower concentration than in A549 cells, a feature that was not observed for other antioxidant molecules (such as CoQ<sub>10</sub>) and two IPF drugs (pirfenidone and nintedanib). Administration of idebenone prevented bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and increased pulmonary ROS levels. Importantly, idebenone also improved pulmonary fibrosis and lung function when administered after the development of fibrosis, whereas administration of CoQ<sub>10</sub> similarly prevented bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, but had no effect after its development. Administration of idebenone, but not CoQ<sub>10</sub>, suppressed bleomycin-induced increases in lung myofibroblasts. In vitro, treatment of LL29 cells with idebenone, but not CoQ<sub>10</sub>, suppressed TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;induced collagen production. These results suggest that in addition to antioxidant activity, idebenone exerts inhibitory activity on the function of lung fibroblasts, with the former activity being preventative and the latter therapeutic for bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Thus, we propose that idebenone may be more therapeutically beneficial for IPF patients than current treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Respiratory tract diseases</kwd><kwd>Drug development</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and devastating chronic lung disease with an ultimately poor prognosis: the average survival time from diagnosis is 2.8&#x02013;4.2 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Although steroids and immunosuppressants have long been used for treatment of IPF, it has been determined that these treatments cannot improve the prognosis of IPF patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Recently, two drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, have been shown to significantly improve the reduction of forced vital capacity (FVC) in clinical trials of IPF patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, both of these drugs have serious adverse effects, especially within the gastrointestinal tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Thus, safer drugs eliciting a therapeutic effect equal to or higher than that of these two approved drugs are necessary.</p><p id="Par3">IPF appears to be triggered by lung epithelial injury resulting from increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the subsequent repair and remodelling process, such as collagen synthesis, induced to address this injury. However, in IPF patients this process is excessively stimulated, resulting in abnormal fibrosis (abnormal wound repair and remodelling) characterised by collagen deposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. As ROS can stimulate collagen synthesis, it is believed that ROS play a pivotal role in IPF pathogenesis. Supporting this notion, a number of antioxidant molecules, such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), have shown beneficial effects in IPF patients and animal models of IPF, such as bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Myofibroblasts produce and secrete excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, and are involved in abnormal wound repair and remodelling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Myofibroblasts are primarily produced by transdifferentiation of peribronchiolar and perivascular fibroblasts in response to various stimuli, especially transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2;1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Thus, compounds that suppress myofibroblast production or inhibit myofibroblast activity are good candidates for drugs to treat IPF patients. In fact, both pirfenidone and nintedanib reportedly suppress the transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and collagen production in activated fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">One possible mechanism for abnormal fibrosis in IPF patients is the &#x0201c;apoptosis paradox&#x0201d;. In IPF patient lungs, apoptosis is preferentially observed in alveolar epithelial cells rather than fibroblasts, and this unbalance of apoptosis is believed to be involved in IPF pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. This characteristic is reproduced in vitro, as compared with lung epithelial cells, lung fibroblasts (especially those from IPF patients) showed resistance to apoptosis by various stressors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Thus, chemicals that improve this balance are also good candidates for drugs to treat IPF patients.</p><p id="Par6">As unexpected adverse effects of potential drugs are often revealed at later clinical trial stages, the number of newly developed drugs is decreasing. Thus, we are implementing a breakthrough strategy for drug discovery and development, focusing on the use of drugs in current clinical use for new indications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. A major advantage of this strategy is that the safety of these drugs is already well understood, which substantially reduces the risk of unexpected side effects in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In previous studies, we screened drugs against IPF, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and functional dyspepsia according to this strategy and found effective drugs for each disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Therefore, we believe that this strategy is useful for discovering new candidates for treating human diseases.</p><p id="Par7">In this study, we screened for compounds capable of inhibiting the growth of lung fibroblasts (LL29 cells) more potently than lung alveolar epithelial cells (A549 cells), and identified idebenone from a library of medicines already in clinical use. Intratracheal administration of idebenone, which has previously been used clinically as a brain metabolic stimulant, suppressed bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, alteration of lung mechanics and increases in pulmonary ROS levels. These results suggest that in addition to antioxidant activity, idebenone has inhibitory activity on the function of lung fibroblasts, with both of these activities contributing to its inhibitory effect on pulmonary fibrosis. Thus, we propose that idebenone may be therapeutically beneficial for IPF patients and have fewer side effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals and animals</title><p id="Par8">Idebenone, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ<sub>10</sub>), edaravone, &#x003b1;-tocopherol and pirfenidone were from Tokyo Chemical Industry (Tokyo, Japan), and nintedanib was from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI).

To develop a new IPF drug, it is important to examine not only its preventive effect but also its therapeutic effects in an animal model of IPF. Further, two recently developed IPF drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, have been reported to have therapeutic effects on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Moreover, as the diagnosis of IPF in human patients is confirmed by a decrease in FVC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, it is important to examine the effect of a candidate drug on BLM-dependent respiratory failure, especially a decrease in FVC. Thus, we examined the therapeutic effect of idebenone and the effect of idebenone on bleomycin-induced decreases in FVC in this study (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). As mentioned in the Results section, idebenone clearly showed both therapeutic and improving effects against BLM-dependent decreases in FVC. We therefore assume that idebenone may have therapeutic benefit for IPF patients in addition to pirfenidone and nintedanib.</p><p id="Par38">While both pirfenidone and nintedanib significantly improved the reduction of FVC in clinical trials of IPF patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and were already approved, they were also reported to have severe adverse effects, such as dyspepsia and diarrhoea in clinical setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.

In contrast, neither pirfenidone nor nintedanib showed preferential cytotoxicity for lung fibroblasts over lung alveolar epithelial cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

As we did not examine the detailed mechanism by which idebenone suppressed ROS levels or preferentially inhibited the growth of lung fibroblasts in this study, these mechanisms need to be clarified to identify the primary target of idebenone.

Moreover, idebenone directly suppressed glycerophosphate-dependent ROS production in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. We suggest that idebenone suppresses bleomycin-dependent ROS increases by these mechanisms. In contrast, the mechanism by which idenenone preferentially inhibited the growth of lung fibroblasts is unknown. A recent study suggested that syndecan-2 attenuates radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis and inhibits fibroblast activation by regulating the PI3K/Akt/ROCK pathway via CD148<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Tsukui et al. have identified osteopontin as the most highly expressed gene in fibroblasts, and suggested that osteopontin may serve as a useful marker of profibrotic fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Moreover, Goodwin et al. showed that targeting the HIF-1&#x003b1;/PDK1 axis suppresses bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis by suppressing myofibroblast differentiation and fibroblast progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.

Based on these reports, we assume that these mechanisms are involved in preferential inhibition of lung fibroblasts by idebenone.</p><p id="Par40">Considering the clinical application of idebenone, it is important to examine the route of administration of idebenone in IPF animal models. Both pirfenidone and nintedanib are administered orally in tablets for treating IPF patients. Idebenone was approved for use as an orally administered drug as a brain metabolic stimulant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In contrast, we examined the effect of intratracheally administered idebenone on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in this study because idebenone is likely to directly suppress the action of pulmonary fibroblasts. In addition, clinical trials have been conducted to investigate the administration of several drugs (such as NAC and interferon) directly to the lungs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Based on this background and because examining the route of administration is highly worthwhile, we hope to examine the route of idebenone administration in IPF animal models in future experiments.</p><p id="Par41">Based on all findings in this study, we propose that idebenone may be therapeutically beneficial for IPF patients, as safety for use in humans has already been clinically confirmed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec16"><p>
