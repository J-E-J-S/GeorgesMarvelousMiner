In crop plants, these compounds provide pest resistance but can also pose risks to human and animal health. One such class of compounds are cyanogenic glycosides, amino acid-derived plant natural products which defend against herbivory. When plant tissue is damaged, hydrolysis of cyanogenic glycosides by plant &#x003b2;-glycosidases produces an unstable cyanohydrin, which releases toxic cyanide on decomposition. Cyanogenic glycosides are found in a wide variety of plants, including many crop plants (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gleadow and M&#x000f8;ller, 2014</xref>). In particular, the staple crop sorghum (<italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic>) produces a cyanogenic glycoside known as dhurrin. Cyanogenic glycosides enhance plant resistance to insects (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gleadow and Woodrow, 2002</xref>), and they can pose a risk to humans (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Tokpohozin et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>) and to livestock as well.</p><p id="p0030">Dhurrin biosynthesis begins with the tyrosine N-monooxygenase SbCYP79A1 (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Koch et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>), which converts L-tyrosine into an oxime derivative, (E)-<italic>p</italic>-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime. This intermediate is then&#x000a0;converted into <italic>p</italic>-hydroxymandelonitrile by the 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime monooxygenase SbCYP71E1 (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bak et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>), and&#x000a0;lastly stabilized by glucosylation by the UDP-glucose:p-hydroxymandelonitrile-O-glucosyltransferase SbUGT85B1 (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Jones et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>), yielding dhurrin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A). The genes encoding these three enzymes form a biosynthetic gene cluster, wherein CYP79A1, CYP71E1, and UGT85B1 appear adjacent to one another in the sorghum genome, along with a transporter which acts to sequester this potentially autotoxic compound in the plant cell vacuole (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Darbani et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>).<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p><bold>A heterologous metabolic pathway for dhurrin biosynthesis in yeast.

In contrast to plants, which grow slowly and are difficult to genetically manipulate, their rapid growth and genetic tractability makes microbes convenient heterologous hosts. In baker's yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>), rapid genetic engineering is facilitated by efficient homology-guided repair, which enables integration of multiple genes into the genome simultaneously (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Shao et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). More recently, the sequence-guided endonuclease Cas9 has been used to increase the efficiency of homologous integration in yeast by inducing double-stranded DNA breaks at the target site in the chromosome (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Ryan et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). <italic>S.&#x000a0;cerevisiae</italic> is a well-established host for plant pathways involving cytochrome P450 enzymes, which must interact with cytochrome P450 reductase partners (CPRs) at the endoplasmic reticulum, an organelle only found in eukaryotes.

However, to our knowledge, no complete cyanogenic glycoside pathway has yet been reconstituted in a microbial system.

Additionally, we used the dhurrin-producing strain as a platform to investigate the function of previously uncharacterized putative enzymes located near the dhurrin cluster in the <italic>S.&#x000a0;bicolor</italic> genome.

While we were unable to demonstrate activity for the previously uncharacterized enzymes Sb120 and Sb121 in the dhurrin gene cluster, our untargeted metabolomics workflow may be applied to characterize other putative cyanogenic glucoside-producing enzymes in heterologous hosts.</p><p id="p0175">Cyanogenic glycoside pathways have independently evolved in a wide range of plants. As initiatives like the 1000 Plant Genomes Project produce more plant genomes and automated pipelines for identifying putative plant biosynthetic pathways are developed (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Medema and Osbourn, 2016</xref>), more candidate cyanogenic glycoside clusters are likely to be identified. Our work demonstrates that enzymes from classes commonly implicated in cyanogenic glycoside production can be functionally expressed in yeast. The capability to rapidly test these clusters in a genetically tractable microbial host free of potentially confounding plant enzyme activities will be a valuable tool for future studies of cyanogenic glycoside biosynthesis.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alberti</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gitler</surname><given-names>A.D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lindquist</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A&#x000a0;suite of Gateway cloning vectors for high-throughput genetic analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</article-title><source>Yeast</source><volume>24</volume><year>2007</year><fpage>913</fpage><lpage>919</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17583893</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Pon</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Greiner</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Wishart</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>CFM-ID: a web server for annotation, spectrum prediction and metabolite identification from tandem mass spectra</article-title><source>Nucleic Acids Res.</source><volume>42</volume><year>2014</year><fpage>W94</fpage><lpage>W99</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24895432</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bak</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kahn</surname><given-names>R.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Nielsen</surname><given-names>H.L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Moller</surname><given-names>B.L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Halkier</surname><given-names>B.A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cloning of three A-type cytochromes P450, CYP71E1, CYP98, and CYP99 from Sorghum bicolor (L.)
