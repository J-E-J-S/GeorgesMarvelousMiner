Synthetic biology, which can be used to design and integrate new biological functions into a cell, provides a powerful way to engineer a microbe for a sustainable bio-industry. Its broad applications can incorporate desirable bio-processes into a designer host to convert biomass to valuable bio-products such as biofuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Moreover, producing multiple bio-products simultaneously in a single microbe, such as co-production of biofuel and valuable natural products, can achieve competitive advantages for a multipurpose biorefinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the toxic effects from precursors, intermediate products or end products can cause a physiological imbalance to the host. Exposure to xenobiotics may lead to an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals intracellularly, which can cause cellular damages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The cellular membrane is an important boundary to protect cells from external stresses, but excessive free radicals can attack the membrane by lipid peroxidation. Previously, metallothioneins, which are the membrane-targeted antioxidative proteins, were demonstrated to improve the cell tolerance against <italic>n</italic>-butanol by scavenging intracellular or extracellular ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, n-butanol production was increased via co-expression of metallothioneins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The results implied that the ROS scavenging capacity of the host cell is important for cell factory development.</p><p id="Par14">In this study, the yeast <italic>Kluyveromyces marxianus</italic> was used as the host because it has several desirable characteristics for industrial applications. First, <italic>K. marxianus</italic> is a Crabtree-negative yeast that exhibits enhanced biomass production when supplementing with excessive glucose. Second, <italic>K. marxianus</italic> is capable of fermentation at a broad range of temperatures (25 to&#x02009;~&#x02009;45&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C). Third, <italic>K. marxianus</italic> can utilize various carbon sources, including lactose, xylose, arabinose, cellobiose, and inulin. Finally, <italic>K. marxianus</italic> is GRAS (generally regarded as safe) and QPS (qualified presumption of safe) and has been widely employed in various biotechnological applications and food industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">In our previous study, a carotenoid biosynthesis pathway was integrated into <italic>K. marxianus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Carotenoids are superior antioxidants, which have an ability to neutralize singlet oxygen and to protect cellular membranes from ultraviolet (UV) light and toxic oxidative stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, carotenoids have been used in the prevention of various human diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and may act as value-added products.</p><p id="Par16">In this study, we tested if our carotenoid-producing <italic>K. marxianu</italic> strains can tolerate toxic compounds that may appear in biofuel production. As consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) provides a simple way to integrate biomass hydrolysis and fermentation in one process, furfurals are often generated from lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysis and inhibit yeast growth. In addition, heavy metals may be present when utilizing biomass harvested from polluted environment. Increasing the tolerance of the host to heavy metals may enhance its ability to utilize biomass from phytoremediation. Phytoremediation may provide a cost-effective way to cleanup heavy metals in contaminated soil and water by plants, and the biomass can then be a source for renewable energy and bio-products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, tolerance assays were conducted to evaluate the potential of carotenoids producing strain for biofuel production that may face ethanol, furfurals and heavy metals. In addition, we also tested the tolerance of the carotenoid-producing strain to ethanol dissolved with 10-deacetylbaccatin III, which is a precursor to paclitaxel, an anti-cancer medicine. Thus, this study explored the potential of using a carotenoid-producing strain as a chassis for constructing multipurpose cell factories.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characterization of two engineered strains</title><p id="Par17">Our carotenoid-biosynthesis pathway includes the truncated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl -coenzyme A reductase (<italic>tHMG1</italic> gene) from <italic>Kluyveromyces marxianus</italic>, the geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (<italic>crtE</italic> gene) from <italic>Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous</italic>, the <italic>crtYB</italic> gene (phytoene synthase/lycopene cyclase) of <italic>X. dendrorhous</italic>, the <italic>crtI</italic> gene (phytoene desaturase) of <italic>X. dendrorhous</italic>, the &#x003b2;-carotene ketolase (<italic>bkt</italic> gene) from <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,</italic> and the &#x003b2;-carotene hydroxylase (<italic>chyb</italic> gene) from <italic>Chlorella zofingiensis</italic>.

The metabolite10-deacetyl baccatin III (10-DB III) is the natural precursor of baccatin III, and it has a high concentration (0.1%) in needle extracts of the common ornamental yew (<italic>Taxus baccata</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and therefore has been considered a cost-efficient and eco-friendly source.

Thus, carotenoid-producing yeast strains can help the conversion of 10-deacetylbaccatin III to paclitaxel or its derivatives.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Survival assays under 10-deacetylbaccatin III and ethanol. <bold>a</bold> The survival of the colonies of WT and Cz30 strains under 10 deacetylbaccatin III (10-DB III) and ethanol. <bold>b</bold> The cell densities of WT and Cz30 strains after growth for 36&#x000a0;h in various concentrations of ethanol mixed with/without 10-DB III. <bold>c</bold>, <bold>d</bold> The cell growth assays under 0.8&#x000a0;mM 10-DB III (+4% EtOH) and 1.2&#x000a0;mM 10-DB III (+6% EtOH), respectively.

However, the host may confront more stresses. The tolerance to multiple stresses and/or toxins is a key challenge to improve the performance of bioconversion. Carotenoids are natural antioxidants that can help tolerate stresses and provide benefits to human health. This concept has here been shown by constructing a carotenoid-production yeast. By using the PGASO method, the target genes were integrated into the genome by homologous recombination that was targeted to the region of Lac4 promoter. The homologous sequence was modified from the Lac4 promoter, so that the integration did not disrupt the landing site but could create one more copy of the Lac4 promoter for further integration. This characteristic provided an opportunity for simultaneous multiple-integrations. Thus, different transgenic lines may carry different copy numbers of the transgenes. Based on the color, we screened strains with higher levels of carotenoids productivity in this study. CZ30 showed a stronger red color than Cz5 and indeed produced more carotenoids than Cz5. Though the transcriptional levels were higher at 30&#x000b0;Cthan at 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, the carotenoid amount was higher at 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The reason is unclear, but carotenoids productivities may depend on not only the expression levels of carotenoid-biosynthesis genes, but also reaction dynamics between enzymes and substrates, which could be temperature dependent. According to HPLC profile, some new peaks were found and may belong to carotenoids family or carotenoids derivatives for further characterization (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: figure S2).</p><p id="Par25">Biorefinery provides a way to efficiently convert renewable biomass to sustainable products, such as biofuels, biochemicals, and biodegradable materials. Plant biomass is considered an abundant resource. However, to facilitate the bioconversion of biomass, pretreatment processes are conducted for lignocellulose destruction, which release various toxic substances and stresses, such as furfurals, which reduce the host performance of bio-alcohol fermentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We showed that an engineered carotenoid-producing <italic>K. marxianus</italic> improved the ability to scavenge free radicals and tolerance to UV damage, furfurals, and ethanol. The enhancement of ethanol tolerance also increased the production of ethanol. In a previous study, <italic>K. marxianus</italic> showed higher tolerance to harsh environment including furfural stress than <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and could be applied to pretreated lignocellulose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Our study supported the potential application of carotenoid producing <italic>K. marxianus</italic> to biofuel production. It also proved the concept of biorefinary to produce ethanol and carotenoid simultaneously. Compared to common industrial yeasts including <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Pichia kluyveri, K. marxianus</italic> can produce higher branched alcohol, such as isobutanol. The tolerance to isobutanol could make carotenoid producing <italic>K. marxianus</italic> more competitive to produce this next generation biofuel. Furthermore, the tolerance to heavy metal provides an attractive way to utilize phytoremediation biomass from contaminated areas. Improvement of cell tolerance by carotenoids increased the potential of multiple-product conversion and multiple resource utilization.</p><p id="Par26">Carbon flux diversion is an inevitable issue when constructing a host to produce multiple products. In general, minimizing flux diversion of byproducts should be made for maximizing the main production. However, as the tolerance may also enhance the productivity or bio-conversion efficiency, it really depends on what kind of product that a cell factory is intended to produce. As we focused on the protection effect at this stage, we used Cz30 because it yielded 250.5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/g of carotenoids whereas Cz5 only yielded 137.2&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/g. In fact, we found that Cz30 was more ethanol tolerant than Cz5 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d&#x02013;f).</p><p id="Par27">Natural secondary metabolites have broad pharmaceutical applications, but the yields are usually very low. In order to obtain a sufficient amount of compounds, chemical semi-synthesis provides a way to convert abundant precursors to the valuable products. However, the chemical process often incurs laborious manipulations and organic pollution. Bio-based production through engineered microorganisms provides a sustainable, reliable and efficient way for green production. To convert natural abundant intermediates to functional products could be faster than synthesis from central carbon flux. However, solvent plays a key role to deliver the hydrophobic intermediate to bioprocess, and the cell tolerance to solvent could be a limitation to bioconversion. For instance, paclitaxel has been used for cancer therapy for a long time and bioconversion is thought to be an efficient way for mass production of paclitaxel from abundant 10-deactylbaccatin III. Our carotenoid-producing strain not only improved the tolerance to ethanol but also to the paclitaxel precursor 10-deactylbaccatin III. It could be applied for improving bio-ethanol production and also for paclitaxel bioconversion. This discovery could be potentially applied to paclitaxel biopharmaceuticals industry.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par28">The engineered carotenoids-producing strain Cz30 showed an enhanced survival rate under the stresses of different toxins such as furfural, arsenate, ethanol, and isobutanol. In addition, the increased tolerance to ethanol allowed the host to deliver more 10-deacetylbaccatin III into the paclitaxel bioconversion process. Thus, our engineered strain Cz30 has great potential to serve as a chassis cell for bio-refinery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>RT-qPCR quantification</title><p id="Par29">The RNA was purified by HiQ-Column 12 automated DNA/RNA Purification System (Protech, Taiwan) with an AccuPure Yeast RNA mini kit (AccuBioMed, Taiwan).
