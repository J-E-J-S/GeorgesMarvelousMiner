    "BACKGROUND:A microorganism engineered for non-native tasks may suffer stresses it never met before. Therefore, we examined whether a Kluyveromyces marxianus strain engineered with a carotenoid biosynthesis pathway can serve as an anti-stress chassis for building cell factories. RESULTS:Carotenoids, a family of antioxidants, are valuable natural products with high commercial potential. We showed that the free radical removal ability of carotenoids can confer the engineered host with a higher tolerance to ethanol, so that it can produce more bio-ethanol than the wild type. Moreover, we found that this engineered strain has improved tolerance to other toxic effects including furfurals, heavy metals such as arsenate (biomass contaminant) and isobutanol (end product). Furthermore, the enhanced ethanol tolerance of the host can be applied to bioconversion of a natural medicine that needs to use ethanol as the delivery solvent of hydrophobic precursors. The result suggested that the engineered yeast showed enhanced tolerance to ethanol-dissolved hydrophobic 10-deacetylbaccatin III, which is considered a sustainable precursor for paclitaxel (taxol) bioconversion. CONCLUSIONS:The stress tolerances of the engineered yeast strain showed tolerance to several toxins, so it may serve as a chassis for cell factories to produce target products, and the co-production of carotenoids may make the biorefinary more cost-effective."
