    "BACKGROUND:Circadian rhythm, regulated by both internal and external environment of the body, is a multi-scale biological oscillator of great complexity. On the molecular level, thousands of genes exhibit rhythmic transcription, which is both organ- and species-specific, but it remains a mystery whether some common factors could potentially explain their rhythmicity in different organs. In this study we address this question by analyzing the transcriptome data in 12 mouse organs to determine such major impacting factors. RESULTS:We found a strong positive correlation between the transcriptional level and rhythmic amplitude of circadian rhythmic genes in mouse organs. Further, transcriptional level could explain over 70% of the variation in amplitude. In addition, the functionality and tissue specificity were not strong predictors of amplitude, and the expression level of rhythmic genes was linked to the energy consumption associated with transcription. CONCLUSION:Expression level is a single major factor impacts the behavior of rhythmic genes in mouse organs. This single determinant implicates the importance of rhythmic expression itself on the design of the transcriptional system. So, rhythmic regulation of highly expressed genes can effectively reduce the energetic cost of transcription, facilitating the long-term adaptive evolution of the entire genetic system."
