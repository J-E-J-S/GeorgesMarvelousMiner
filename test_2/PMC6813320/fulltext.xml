Genetic variation of enhancer sequences is known to influence phenotypes, but the effect of enhancer variation upon enhancer functional activity and downstream phenotypes has barely been examined in any species. In the African malaria vector, <italic>Anopheles coluzzii</italic>, we identified candidate enhancers in the proximity of genes relevant for immunity, insecticide resistance, and development. The candidate enhancers were functionally validated using luciferase reporter assays, and their activity was found to be essentially independent of their physical orientation, a typical property of enhancers. All of the enhancers segregated genetically polymorphic alleles, which displayed significantly different levels of functional activity. Deletion mutagenesis and functional testing revealed a fine structure of positive and negative regulatory elements that modulate activity of the enhancer core. Enhancer polymorphisms segregate in wild <italic>A. coluzzii</italic> populations in West Africa. Thus, enhancer variants that modify target gene expression leading to likely phenotypic consequences are frequent in nature. These results demonstrate the existence of naturally polymorphic <italic>A. coluzzii</italic> enhancers, which may help explain important differences between individuals or populations for malaria transmission efficiency and vector adaptation to the environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Gene regulation</kwd><kwd>Evolutionary biology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The European Commission, Horizon 2020 Infrastructures #731060 Infravec2; European Research Council, Support for Frontier Research, Advanced Grant #323173 AnoPath; and French Laboratoire d&#x00026;apos;Excellence "Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious Diseases&#x00026;quot; #ANR-10-LABX-62-IBEID.</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Enhancers are short cis-acting regulatory elements in noncoding DNA that amplify transcriptional levels of target genes by tens to hundreds fold over the basal level of core promoter elements at the transcription start site.

The standard test for enhancer activity is by cloning the candidate in a plasmid carrying a basal promoter and a luciferase reporter gene in an episomal assay. An active enhancer will augment the rate of transcription from the basal promoter, thus elevating the expression level of the luciferase gene. Luciferase expression is measured by adding luciferase substrate to cell extract and detecting light output as relative light units (RLU).

For this, alleles of the enhancers were amplified and sequenced from <italic>A. coluzzii</italic> colonies initiated from the populations in Cameroon, Mali or Burkina Faso. For each of the six enhancers, at least two distinct genetic variants were chosen for tests of enhancer activity. The goal was to identify and test a range of genetic variants, not the mosquito colonies. Therefore, a given colony may or may not be represented for a given enhancer, depending on the variation it segregates. The enhancer alleles were cloned and sequenced, and neighbor joining (N-J) trees depict the evolutionary relatedness and degree of sequence difference of the alleles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

For five of the six enhancers, alleles displayed significantly different levels of enhancer activity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). For a given enhancer, alleles with the greatest difference in activity tended to be the most genetically different from each other (see also Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). For example, the alleles of the KLF enhancer cloned from colonies Fd05 and Fd03 are the most closely related genetically, and do not display a difference in luciferase activity as compared to the allele from colony Fd09. For two enhancers (LRIM1 and ACE1), at least one genetic variant displayed activity levels that were not significantly different from background, which effectively represents a naturally occurring functionally inactive null enhancer allele. Genetic variation segregating at the enhancer of Ovo did not display a significant influence on luciferase activity, and the Ovo enhancer appears to display the consistently highest luciferase activity over all alleles tested for any of the six enhancers. These results indicate that genetic alleles of validated enhancers can display significantly different levels of functional activity. The large observed differences in enhancer activity are expected to be translated into differential expression of the target genes that are regulated by the polymorphic enhancer alleles, likely leading to phenotypic differences in the organism related to the target gene functions. Enhancer allele outcomes for phenotype will need to be tested in manipulative experiments.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Genetic variation influences enhancer functional activity.

The deletion results indicate that enhancer activity is not directly correlated with sequence length, that there is a complex structure of functional elements and modifiers within the enhancer interval, and that different alleles of the same enhancer are comprised of distinct combinations of modular regulators that differentially influence transcription.</p><p id="Par16">The density of variable sites between Fd03_#3 and Fd05_#1 varies across the interval, such that there were 60 variable nucleotide sites in the integral 100% length alleles, 37 variable sites in the 50% derivatives and 22 sites in the 25% derivatives (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>).

The currently examined enhancers were chosen because they were located near known functional genes, which were used to name the enhancers for convenience, but further work will be required to determine the actual influence, if any, of these enhancers upon the nearby genes, which is not known. Moreover, enhancer function is also controlled on spatial and temporal scales within the organism, and understanding <italic>Anopheles</italic> enhancers and their effects on phenotypes in detail will ultimately require incorporating this information.</p><p id="Par19">Here we identify and validate candidate enhancer noncoding regulatory elements in the malaria vector, <italic>A. coluzzii</italic>. We show that naturally segregating genetic variation significantly influences enhancer activity levels. By modifying the level of enhancer activity, genetic variation in enhancers can cause quantitative changes in expression of the target genes regulated by the enhancers, leading to differences in biological function and ultimately mosquito phenotype. Different from mutations in protein coding genes, enhancers are typically located in noncoding DNA, and there is no sequence pattern to aid interpretation of noncoding variants. Most mosquito studies to date have focused solely on genes and proteins, rather than regulatory elements controlling the genes, in part due to the limited information available for the noncoding portion of the genome.</p><p id="Par20">We detected variant alleles with significant difference in their functional enhancer activity, including functional null alleles that lack enhancer activity above background. For example, the LRIM1 enhancer Fd05_#1 allele or the ACE1 Fd03_#1 allele likely represent the ablation of an important transcription factor binding site, resulting in the absence of enhancer activity above background, which likely has downstream functional consequences. The range in functional enhancer activity that we observed is likely to affect phenotypes produced by the genes they transcriptionally regulate. Moreover, we demonstrate that variant alleles tested by luciferase activity in laboratory colonies also segregate in the wild population, and are therefore subject to natural selection. Thus, it is intriguing that selection has apparently generated a wide range of natural allelic forms of enhancers, including alleles that lack functional activity. This is consistent with the observation that genetic variation for enhancer function offers powerful raw material for adaptation and evolutionary change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The members of the Gambiae species complex, including <italic>A. coluzzii</italic>, are highly adaptable to a range of ecological conditions, and durable to vector control measures. This is thought to be associated with their high genetic diversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The current study is novel in that it addresses standing genetic variation for noncoding regulatory function, which is a poorly understood but likely important contributing factor influencing the success of this mosquito and its relatives.</p><p id="Par21">We functionally dissected two alleles of the LRIM1 enhancer, high and low activity variants, respectively, by deletion mutagenesis. By measuring functional activity of integral, 50% and 25% length derivatives of the intervals, we detected a modular structure of positive and negative regulators within the enhancer. Interestingly, deletion derivatives of the two alleles behaved differently, indicating that the outcome was not a simple consequence of sequence length. The high-activity allele Fd03_#3 appears to carries a negative regulator in the terminal one-quarter of its length on one or both ends, because removal of these sequences led to significantly elevated activity in the remaining 50% derivative as compared to the integral enhancer. However, removal of an additional one-quarter again of the sequence from both ends of the 50% derivative then diminished activity to a level below that of the integral enhancer, suggesting that the positive regulator(s) revealed in the 50% length derivative were no longer present in the 25% length derivative.</p><p id="Par22">That the low activity of the smallest derivative of Fd05_#1 was not a simple consequence of sequence length is made clear by a similar examination of the low-activity allele Fd05_#1. In this case, each incremental length decrease of the tested sequence led to increased enhancer activity. The Fd05_#1 allele result suggests that the integral enhancer displayed low activity because it carried multiple negative regulators, which were removed by each successive deletion, revealing a highly active core enhancer element within the smallest interval tested. This latter minimal derivative of the low-activity Fd05_#1 allele carries an enhancer with, in fact, higher enhancer activity than the integral 100% sequence of the high-activity Fd03_#3 allele.</p><p id="Par23">The LRIM1 deletion mutagenesis results suggest that that large functional allelic diversity can be generated for a given enhancer interval by the combinatorial effect of positive and negative modifiers.

From the current results, we do not know whether the specific positive and negative modifiers found within the LRIM1 alleles are reused and combined to fine-tune the activity of different enhancers. If so, such regulator modules should be recognizable with enough genomic and functional data. Finally, the phenotypic implications of enhancer alleles will require determination of the target genes regulated by an enhancer, as well as the protein-DNA interactions underlying differential enhancer allele activity.</p><p id="Par24">Vector control has been central to the malaria control effort by use of indoor residual spraying and long-lasting insecticide impregnated bednets.

The noncoding regulatory genome in <italic>Anopheles</italic> has the potential to provide novel new targets for vector control, but until now has not been interpretable or exploitable. For example, noncoding variants genetically associated with phenotypic traits could be interpreted by their functional enhancer activity. Consequently, enhancer variants could serve as markers for traits such as insecticide resistance, parasite susceptibility, behavior or adaptation to ecological conditions. Understanding the genomic enhancer landscape could improve the choice of insertion sites for exogenous transgenes for proper expression, and enhancers themselves could be genetically modified in order to alter transcription of immune or disease important genes with phenotypic consequences. The current work presents a necessary first step towards establishing an efficient, effective method for associating noncoding variation with important mosquito phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Wild mosquito samples and DNA library</title><p id="Par25">Mosquito larvae were collected in Goundry village, Burkina Faso (latitude 12.5166876, longitude &#x02212;1.3921092) using described methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, reared to adults, and were typed for species by the SINE200 X6.1 assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.
